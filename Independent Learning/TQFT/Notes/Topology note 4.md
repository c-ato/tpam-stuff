> [!theorem|*]- Compactness is Invariant on a Continuous Function
> If $f$ is a continuous function, then the image of the compact set under $f$ is also compact.
 ^thm-top-inv-comp-cont-func

> [!theorem|*]- Transitivity of Compactness on Closed Subsets
> Any closed subset $C$ of a compact space $K$ is also compact.
 ^thm-top-trans-clos-subset

> [!theorem|*]- One-point
> For any non-compact space $X$ the one-point compactification of $X$ is obtained by adding one extra point $∞$ and defining the open sets of the new space to be the open sets of $X$ together with the sets of the form $G ∪ ∞$, where $G$ is an open subset of $X$ such that $X \setminus G$ is compact.
