Interesting points, kinda relevant to TQFT aspect as well:
- $\mathbb{R}^{2}=\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$
- $Cyl=S^{1}\times I$ where $I\in z$ and $S^{1}\in(x,y)$
- $Tor=S^{1}\times S^{1}$

> [!theorem|*]- Projection Properties of Product Topology
> When $X × Y$ is equipped with the product topology, the projections $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ are continuous functions and are open maps. In addition, the product topology on $X × Y$ is the smallest topology for which the projections are continuous.
