You may attempt as many questions as you wish, but any marks in excess of 28% will be disregarded. 1. Give one reason why the photoelectric effect cannot be explained in terms of the classical wave picture of light. Electrons with a maximum kinetic energy of 1.7eV are emitted when a metal is illuminated by light of frequency 1.0⇥1015 Hz. Calculate the longest wavelength of light for which photoelectrons can be ejected from the metal. [5] 2. Light travelling through air is incident on a piece of optical glass. Explain what happens, and why, when the light is reﬂected at the angle called Brewster’s angle. Derive an expression for Brewster’s angle in terms of the refractive index of glass (you may assume that the refractive index of air, nair =1). What is Brewster’s angle for optical glass with a refractive index of 1.4? [5] 3. When electrons in He+ ions (helium atoms with one electron removed) are excited to the n =3 level, photons are emitted with wavelengths 1.67⇥10−7 m, 2.57 ⇥ 10−8 m and 3.05 ⇥ 10−8 m. Estimate the ionisation energy of the electron in the ground state of He +. [5] 4. Use the method of phasors to derive the intensity variation of the diffraction pattern for ﬁve slits of negligible width, each separated by a distance d. [5] A22500 Page 2 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 5. A particle conﬁned to a one-dimensional potential well between 0  x  L is described by the normalised wave function Ψ(x, t)= r 2 L sin ✓πx L ◆ exp (−iωt) . Find the probability of ﬁnding the particle in the region 0  x  L 4 . How does this result differ from the classical expectation? [5] 6. A police radar gun operating at a frequency of 30 GHz is used to detect the speed of an approaching car. If a beat frequency between the transmitted waves and those reﬂected from the car of 2 kHz is observed, at what speed was the car moving in units of km/h? [You may use the fact that the Doppler shift for v ⌧ c is given by ∆f/f0 = v/c.] [5] A22500 Page 3 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR SECTION 2 Answer both questions from this Section. Note that each question has two parts, of which only one part should be answered. If you answer both parts, credit will only be given for the best answer. 7. EITHER (Part A) (a) Brieﬂy describe the key features of the Davisson and Germer experiment and explain how it provided evidence for the wave nature of electrons. [5] (b) When 100 eV electrons are incident upon a crystal, peaks in scattered intensity are observed as the crystal is rotated. If the largest angle between the incident and scattered beams at which a peak is observed isdegrees, calculate the angles at which all further peaks in the scattered intensity will be observed. [9] (c) What energy of X-rays would give rise to peaks in reﬂected intensity at the same angles as those found in part (b)? [2] (d) Use the Bohr model of the atom to obtain an expression for the approximate energy of Kα X-rays as a function of atomic number, Z. State any assumptions that you make. Hence show that the energy of Kα X-rays from copper (Z =29) is approximately 8keV. [6] (e) The X-ray absorption spectrum of copper has L absorption edges clustered around 950 eV. If a sample of copper is bombarded with electrons, approximately what is the minimum electron energy required to observeα X-rays? Explain whether or not you would also expect to observe Kβ X-rays. [3] A22500 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 7. OR (Part B) (a) The time-independent Schr ¨odinger equation (TISE) in one dimension is − ~2 2m d2ψ(x) dx2 + V (x)ψ(x)= Eψ(x). Using the TISE as an example, explain what is meant by the term eigenvalue equation in quantum mechanics. Identify the operators in the TISE and explain what they represent physically. [5] (b) A particle of mass, m, is conﬁned in an inﬁnite one-dimensional potential well in the region 0  x  L. The non-zero potential inside the well is V (x)= V0. Show that the wave function ψ(x)= Aeikx + Be−ikx is a solution to the TISE in this case and ﬁnd an expression for the wavenumber, k, in terms of E, V0 and m. [4] (c) State and explain the boundary condition that the wave function must satisfy at the boundaries of the well. Hence show that A = −B and show that the allowed values of k in this problem are k = nπ L , where n is a positive non-zero integer. [5] (d) Use the answer to part (c) to show that expectation value for the momentum in any state is equal to zero. (Hint: You do not need to normalise the wave [7] (e) Explain why the momentum of the particle inside the well cannot be equal to zero. Explain how your answer to this question is consistent with the expectation value for the momentum of the particle from part (d). [4] A22500 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 8.

[Note that (1 + x)n =1 + nx + n(n − 1)x2/2! + .. .] For the wave in part (a) deduce the kinetic and potential energies associated with an element dx, in terms of x, t, T and µ. [10] (c) For the wave in part (a) deduce the average power transmitted along a string of mass per unit length µ =0.02 kg/m, held under a tension of 0.02 N. [6] (d) The wave passes from the string with mass per unit length of µ =0.02 kg/m to a connected string of µ =0.04 kg/m. What are the amplitudes of the reﬂected and transmitted waves?

[8] (b) Two thin lenses are placed 20 cm apart. They both have a focal length of 10 cm. An object 2mm tall is placed 50 cm in front of the ﬁrst lens. Where is the image produced by the second lens formed? What is the size of this [7] (c) A thin ﬁlm of oil (refractive index = 1.4) ﬂoats on the surface of water (refractive index = 1.3). Light is reﬂected from the ﬁlm at normal incidence. The reﬂected light is observed to be red in colour (λ =650 nm). What is the minimum thickness of the ﬁlm?
