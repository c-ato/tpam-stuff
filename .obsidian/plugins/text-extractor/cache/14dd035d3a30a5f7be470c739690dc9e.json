(a) Deﬁne what is meant by the terms stable ﬁxed point, unstable ﬁxed point, stable 2-cycle and unstable 2-cycle of an iterated map, xn+1 = f (xn). State the conditions for stability and instability of a ﬁxed point. Deduce from these the corresponding conditions for stability and instability of a 2-cycle. [4] Consider the iterated map deﬁned by xn+1 = f (x) = rxn − x3 , where r ≥ 0 is a variable parameter. (b) Find the three ﬁxed points of this map, and analyse their existence and stabil- ity as the parameter r is varied. [3] (c) Given that the equation f (f (x)) = x can be rewritten in the form x(x2 − r + 1)(x2 − r − 1)(x4 − rx2 + 1) = 0, deduce all the 2-cycles of the map. For what values of r are they stable? [3] [Hint: You may ﬁnd useful the identities [√r + 2 ± √r − 2 2 ]2 = r ± √r2 − 4 2 [√r + 2 + √r − 2 2 ] [√r + 2 − √r − 2 2 ] = 1.] 2 (TURN OVER) A19919 Any Calculator 2. A competition model is given by the differential equations dR dt = f (R, S) = r1R(1 − R) − r1a1RS dS dt = g(R, S) = r2S(1 − S) − r2a2RS, where R(t) and S(t) are the (suitably scaled) rabbit and sheep populations at time t, and r1, r2, a1, a2 are positive constants. (a) Explain the biological meaning of the terms r1R, −r1R2, −r1a1RS, r2S, −r2S2, and −r2a2RS, which occur on the right hand side of the differential equations. What is the nature of the scaling which has been applied to reduce the equations to the above form? [2] (b) Explain what is meant by a ﬁxed point, (R∗, S∗), and deduce the four ﬁxed points of the above system, and the values of parameters a1 and a2 for which they are biologically sensible. [3] A linear stability analysis about a ﬁxed point of the above dynamical system leads to solutions of the form R − R∗ = heλt, S − S∗ = keλt, where the λ are solutions of the quadratic equation λ2 − (A + D)λ + AD − BC = 0, and A, B, C, D, are given by A = ∂f ∂R(R∗, S∗), B = ∂f ∂S (R∗, S∗), C = ∂g ∂R(R∗, S∗), D = ∂g ∂S (R∗, S∗). (c) What conditions must the two solutions, λ1,2, of the above quadratic equation satisfy for the ﬁxed point to be: (i) a stable node; (ii) an unstable node; (iii) a saddle point? [2] (d) Deduce the nature of the four ﬁxed points as a function of the parameters a1 and a2. [Hint: If either B = 0 or C = 0, the two solutions of the quadratic equation are λ = A and λ = D.] [3] 3 (TURN OVER) A19919 Any Calculator 3. (a) Deﬁne what is meant by self-similarity, and give an example of where it may be seen in a system that also exhibits chaos. [2] (b) Show that a square has fractal dimension 2, using a method which may also be used for non-integer dimensions. Carefully explain the steps in your calcu- [2] (c) The Cantor set can be constructed by taking the line 0 < x < 1, and remov- ing the middle third. This is repeated at each iteration. Draw the process, and ﬁnd the associated fractal dimension. [2] (d) By considering their base 3 representation, show that the elements of the Cantor set may be put into one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the original line 0 < x < 1. [2] (e) Show that 4/13 is a member of the Cantor set, and deduce the element of the original line, 0 < x < 1, which it may be put into one-to-one correspondence with.
