The is a degeneracy of 2 (we can fit two electrons) in the n=1 subshell, 8 in the n=2 etc Boltzmann factor changes accordingly: 𝑃𝑟 𝐸𝑖 ∝ 𝑔 𝐸 ⅇ− 𝐸𝑖 𝜅𝐵𝑇 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 n = 1, g(E) = 2; n = 2, g(E) = 8… g(E) represents the degeneracy Boltzmann factors meet an ideal gas Most important assumption for an ideal gas (in terms of energy): Internal energy all comes from the average kinetic energy of the molecules, 𝐸𝐾 (i.e. temperature) Boltzmann factor for an ideal gas hence takes the form 𝑃𝑟 𝐸𝑖 ∝ ⅇ− 𝐸𝐾 𝑘𝐵𝑇 Boltzmann factors meet an ideal gas Other assumptions for an ideal gas: • Thermal equilibrium (average KE does not change) and no gravity • Molecules are much smaller than their average separation • Huge number of molecules (~ 1023) • Molecules have the same mass and size • Directions of molecules are essentially “random” • Molecules can collide, but do so infrequently and elastically (no energy loss) • The molecules are non-relativistic (we can say that 𝐸𝐾 = 0.5 𝑚𝑣2) “1 dimensional” ideal gas The velocity of a gas can be split into three components in each cartesian direction: 𝑣2 = 𝑣𝑥 2 + 𝑣𝑦 2 + 𝑣𝑧 2 Easiest to start just considering the 𝑥 direction 𝑥 𝑦 𝑧 Boltzmann factor for the 𝑥 direction Need to consider the probability of having a velocity somewhere between 𝑣𝑥 and 𝑣𝑥 + ⅆ𝑣𝑥: 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑥 → 𝑣𝑥 + ⅆ𝑣𝑥 = න 𝑣𝑥 𝑣𝑥+ⅆ𝑣𝑥 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑥 ⅆ𝑣𝑥 𝑥 𝑦 𝑧 Boltzmann factor for the 𝑥 direction ׬𝑣𝑥 𝑣𝑥+ⅆ𝑣𝑥 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑥 ⅆ𝑣𝑥 = ඲ 𝑣𝑥 𝑣𝑥+ⅆ𝑣𝑥 𝐶ⅇ− 0.5𝑚 𝑣𝑥 2 𝑘𝐵𝑇 ⅆ𝑣𝑥 (which we should normalise) Standard integral: ධ −∞ ∞ ⅇ−𝑎𝑥2 ⅆ𝑥 = 𝜋 𝑎 𝐶 = 𝑚 2𝜋𝑘𝐵𝑇 and therefore 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑥 = 𝑚 2𝜋𝑘𝐵𝑇 ⅇ− 0.5𝑚 𝑣𝑥 2 𝑘𝐵𝑇 Boltzmann factor for the 𝑥 direction 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑥 = 𝑚 2𝜋𝑘𝐵𝑇 ⅇ− 0.5𝑚 𝑣𝑥 2 𝑘𝐵𝑇 A distribution centred around 0 is expected, as velocity can be either positive or negative As we increase temperature, we increase the chance of occupying higher energy states (higher 𝑣𝑥) Interesting cases: 1) 𝑇 → 0 : 𝑃𝑟 𝐸0 = 1, 𝑃𝑟 𝐸1 = 0 2) 𝑇 → ∞ : 𝑃𝑟 𝐸0 = 0.5, 𝑃𝑟 𝐸1 No degeneracy in this distribution: only one way to have a specific 𝑣𝑥 Logically, 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑥 = 𝑚 2𝜋𝑘𝐵𝑇 ⅇ− 0.5𝑚 𝑣𝑥 2 𝑘𝐵𝑇 𝑃𝑟 𝑣 = 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑥 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑦 𝑃𝑟 𝑣𝑧 Hence , 𝑃𝑟 𝑣 = 𝑔 𝑣 𝑚 2𝜋𝑘𝐵𝑇 Τ3 2 ⅇ− 0.5𝑚(𝑣𝑥 2+𝑣𝑦 2 +𝑣𝑧 2) 𝑘𝐵𝑇 Say that 𝑣2 = 100… Boltzmann factor for 3D space 𝑣𝑥 = 10 𝑣𝑦 = 0 𝑣𝑧 = 0 𝑣𝑥 = 0 𝑣𝑦 = 10 𝑣𝑧 = 0 𝑣𝑥 = 0 𝑣𝑦 = 0 𝑣𝑧 = 10 𝑣𝑥 = 5 𝑣𝑦 = 8 𝑣𝑧 = 11 etc Degeneracy!
