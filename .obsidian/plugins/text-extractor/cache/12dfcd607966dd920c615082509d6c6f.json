Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. No calculator is permitted in this examination. Page 1 Turn over No Calculator Section A 1. (a) Let X and Y be sets. Define what it means for f to be a function from X to Y . [3] (b) Let f : R → R be a function and α, ℓ ∈ R. [8] (i) Define what it means that lim x→α f (x) = ℓ.

(a) We want to construct a cylindrical can with a bottom but no top that will have a volume of 27π cm3. Determine the dimensions (the radius and height) of the can that will minimize the amount of material needed to construct the can. Justify the assertion that you make. You can use any of the results discussed in lectures, provided you clearly state what you are using. [8] (b) Determine whether the following limits exist, and if so find their values. Justify your an- swers. You can use any of the results discussed in lectures, provided you clearly state what you are using. [10] (i) lim x→0 ex cos x + 5√ 1 − x 1 + arctan x + ln(1 − x) .

Use Riemann’s Criterion or otherwise to prove that f is integrable. [8] (b) Suppose that R = {0, 1, 3, 4}, S = {2, 3} and g : [0, 4] → [5, 10]. Prove directly, without using the Partition Lemma, that L(g, R) ≤ L(g, R ∪ S). [5] (c) Suppose that h : (0, 1) → R is given by h(x) := ∫ 2x+1 0 √ 100 − t4 dt for all x ∈ (0, 1). Prove that h is differentiable and find an expression for the derivative h′(x), for all x ∈ (0, 1), that does not contain the integral or antiderivative symbol ∫ . [6] (d) A soft drink company has a 10, 000 litre (L) industrial mixing tank filled with pure water. The tank is drained at a rate of 12 litres per minute (L min−1) whilst a syrup solution containing 10 kilograms per litre (kg L −1) of sugar is pumped into the tank at a rate of 10 L min −1. Assuming that the mixture is instantly and uniformly mixed, formulate and solve an initial value problem to model the mass of sugar y(t) in the tank after t minutes of mixing for all t ∈ [0, 5000].
