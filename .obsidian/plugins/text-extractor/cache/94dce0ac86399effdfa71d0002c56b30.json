Recap from last time What is the relationship between heat energy, ΔQ, transferred to a system and its corresponding increase in temperature, ΔT? Δ𝑄 = 𝐶Δ𝑇 → 𝐶 = ⅆ𝑄 ⅆ𝑡 Varies depending on the amount of material, so can define Specific heat capacity (J kg-1 K-1) -> C = mc Molar heat capacity (J mol-1 K-1) Higher heat capacity, smaller increase in temperature for a given heat Heat capacity of the system (J/K) Recap from last time Take any three systems, A, B and C If A is in thermal equilibrium with B and is also in thermal equilibrium with C, then B and C must also be in thermal equilibrium All systems in equilibrium with one another share a common temperature This is the zeroth law of thermodynamics A B A C B C Boyle’s law Constant temperature (isotherm) Data for these plots taken from https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/40/jresv40n6p457_A1b.pdf “The absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies, if the temperature and amount of gas remains unchanged within a closed system” 𝑃 ∝ 1 𝑉 Charles’ law “When the pressure on a sample of [an ideal gas] is held constant, the Kelvin temperature and volume will be in direct proportion” 𝑇 ∝ 𝑉 Constant pressure (isobar) Data for these plots taken from https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/40/jresv40n6p457_A1b.pdf Equation of state: Ideal gas law 𝑃 ∝ 1 𝑉 (for a fixed 𝑇) and 𝑇 ∝ 𝑉 (for a fixed 𝑃) Thus, we can write that 𝑃𝑉 = 𝑘𝑇 𝑃𝑉 = 𝑛𝑅𝑇 (for moles) 𝑃𝑉 = 𝑁𝑘𝐵𝑇 (for molecules) n: number of moles R: gas constant (8.314 J mol-1 K-1) N: number of molecules = 𝑁𝐴 x n 𝑘𝐵: Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 x 10-23 J K-1) = R/𝑁𝐴 Equation of state 𝑃𝑉 = 𝑛𝑅𝑇 An equation of state allows us to describe the macroscopic state of our gas – we usually do this on a 𝑃𝑉 diagram – a point on this plot represents a specific state With two of the three variables, we can always determine the third Constant temperature (isotherm) Data for these plots taken from https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/40/jresv40n6p457_A1b.pdf Q: If the two curves T1 and T2 are obtained for the same gas through changing P and V at a fixed T and n, is 1) T1 < T2? 2) T1 = T2? 3) T1 > T2? What is an ideal gas? A collection of molecules (or atoms, for a monatomic gas) that are non- interacting (no inter-atomic forces) that collide elastically The internal energy of the gas is dependent on the velocities (kinetic energies) of the molecules, and hence on the temperature, and not on pressure and volume Joule’s second law V/2 V/2 V BEFORE AFTER Ideal gas Vacuum Impermeable membrane The membrane separating the volumes is removed laterally, so no work is done on the gas Temperature of the gas did not change in this case! 𝜕𝑈 𝜕𝑉 = 0 and so the internal energy only depends on temperature! https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_general-chemistry-principles-patterns-and-applications-v1.0/section_14/5431a0c57cd814bf3cef509aa88634d1.jpghttps://saylordotorg.github.io/text_general-chemistry-principles-patterns-and-applications-v1.0/section_14/e524c43ad0c0149af3325f4909df3025.jpg What is an ideal gas? A collection of molecules (or atoms, for a monatomic gas) that are non- interacting (no inter-atomic forces) that collide elastically The internal energy of the gas is dependent on the velocities (kinetic energies) of the molecules, and hence on the temperature, and not on pressure and volume For high KE (and hence T), interatomic forces are negligible For low pressure, space between molecules increases (and hence interatomic potential decreases – think LJ potential) We will be dealing with classical (Maxwell-Boltzmann) gases – other examples include Fermi and Bose gases Changing temperature of an ideal gas How do we go from T1 to T2? Need to change the internal energy of the gas somehow Constant temperature (isotherm) Data for these plots taken from https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/40/jresv40n6p457_A1b.pdf 1) Transfer heat to the gas Force 2) Do some work on the gas Work done on a gas Pressure on the gas = force/area Δ𝑊 = force x Δ𝐿 Δ𝑊 = pressure x area x Δ𝐿 Δ𝑊 = pressure x Δ𝑉 𝑊on = ׬ ⅆ𝑊 = ׬ 𝑃 ⅆ𝑉 is therefore the work done on the gas 𝑊by = − ׬ 𝑃 ⅆ𝑉 is the work done by the gas (conservation of energy) Force Area Δ𝐿 Relationship of work and heat Mass drops, doing work as potential energy is converted to kinetic energy (mgh) Paddles are spun by falling mass, raising the temperature of the water Heat energy and mechanical work must be related Thermometer Mass, m h https://www.jstor.org/stable/108427?seq=2 The 1st law of thermodynamics From Joule’s experiments (and logic), it is clear that the change in internal energy of a system, Δ𝑈, is increases with increasing heat transferred into the system, 𝑄𝑖𝑛, as well as work done on the system, 𝑊on Δ𝑈 = 𝑄𝑖𝑛 + 𝑊on We can also use this to define internal energy of a system… Just an expression showing conservation of energy! Summary Discussed what an ideal gas is (a non-interacting collection of molecules that collide elastically) and how we can describe it (using any two of the state variables P, V and T) Learnt that the internal energy of an ideal gas is entirely dependent on the temperature (average kinetic energy of its constituent molecules) Found that Δ𝑈 = 𝑄𝑖𝑛 + 𝑊on, and that in this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
