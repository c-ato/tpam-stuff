Model solutions will only be released for questions Q1-Q4. Q1. (a) Suppose that X ⊆ R is not empty and that N ∈ R is an upper bound for X. Prove that if for each ϵ > 0, there exists x in X such that N − ϵ < x, then N = sup X. (b) Find, with proof, the infimum of the set A := {x : 3 < |x − 2| < 5} (c) Suppose that P = {0, 4, 12, 17, 20} and g : [0, 20] → R is given by g(x) := 3x + 7. (i) Calculate the Riemann–Darboux sums L(g, P ) and U (g, P ). (ii) For each n ∈ N, let Pn denote the partition of [0, 20] into n subintervals of equal width. Find a natural number N such that U (g, PN ) − L(g, PN ) < 1 1,000 . The Riemann–Darboux sums calculator (Spring Week 1 Materials on Canvas) may be helpful in part (c). Solution. (a) Proof. We know that N is an upper bound for X, we only need to prove that N is the least upper bound for X (recall (3)(b) in Definition 1.1.1 in the Lecture Notes). To that end, suppose that M is an upper bound for X. Assume for a contradiction that N > M , so then ϵ := N − M > 0, and by the assumption in the question there exists x in X such that N − ϵ < x. Now observe that N − ϵ = M , but M < x ∈ X is in contradiction with the fact M is an upper bound for X. This shows that N ≤ M whenever M is an upper bound for X, hence N = sup X, as required. □ (b) Observe that A = {x : 3 < (x − 2) < 5} ∪ {x : 3 < −(x − 2) < 5} = {x : 5 < x < 7} ∪ {x : −3 > (x − 2) > −5} = {x : 5 < x < 7} ∪ {x : −1 > x > −3} = (−3, −1) ∪ (5, 7) We claim that inf A = −3. To prove this, observe that x ≥ −3 for all x ∈ A, so −3 is a lower bound for A. Next, if ϵ ∈ (0, 1), then −3 + ϵ ≥ −3 + ϵ 2 ∈ A, so −3 + ϵ is not a lower bound for A. Finally, if ϵ ≥ 1, then −3 + ϵ ≥ −3 + 1 = −2 ∈ A, so −3 + ϵ is not a lower bound for A. This show that −3 is the greatest lower bound for A, hence inf A = −3. (c)(i) Using the notation P = {0, 4, 12, 17, 20} =: {x0, x1, x2, x3, x4}, we calculate L(g, P ) = 4∑ i=1 mi(xi − xi−1) = g(0)(4 − −0) + g(4)(12 − 4) + g(12)(17 − 12) + g(17)(20 − 17) = 7(4) + 19(8) + 43(5) + 58(3) = 28 + 152 + 215 + 174 = 569 1 2 and U (g, P ) = 4∑ i=1 Mi(xi − xi−1) = g(4)(4 − −0) + g(12)(12 − 4) + g(17)(17 − 12) + g(20)(20 − 17) = 19(4) + 43(8) + 58(5) + 67(3) = 76 + 344 + 290 + 201 = 911. Alternatively, these calculations can be done using the Riemann–Darboux Sums Calculator on Canvas, but a screenshot as in Figure 1 below must be provided. Figure 1. Two graphs of g(x) := 3x + 7 showing the areas covered by L(g, Q) = 569 and U (g, Q) = 911 for Q = {0, 4, 12, 17, 20}. 3 (c)(ii) The Riemann–Darboux Sums Calculator does not provide the required accuracy. Instead, the key point is to recognise that the function g is increasing. Suppose that n ∈ N and consider the equal-width partition Pn := {x0, x1, . . . , xn} of [0, 20] into n sub-intervals of width 20/n. The majority of the terms in U (g, Pn) − L(g, Pn) cancel, as we find that U (g, Pn) − L(g, Pn) = n∑ i=1 Mi(xi − xi−1) − n∑ i=1 mi(xi − xi−1) = n∑ i=1 g(xi) 20 n − n∑ i=1 g(xi−1) 20 n = 20 n [(g(x1) + · · · + g(xn)) − (g(x0) + · · · + g(xn−1))] = 20 n [g(xn) − g(x0)] = 20 n [g(20) − g(0)] = 1, 200 n . Therefore, we need a natural number n such that 1,200 n < 1 1,000 , which is the same as requiring that n > 1, 200, 000. Now choose N := 1, 200, 001. The preceding computation shows that U (g, PN ) − L(g, PN ) = 1,200 N = 1,200 1,200,001 < 1 1,000 , as required. Of course, there is no need to be so precise with the choice of N , as any natural number larger than 1,200,000 is an equally valid choice to answer this question, provided the justification above is given. Alternatively, replacing x with 3x + 7 and setting b = 20 in Exercise 1.2.7 of the Lecture Notes, we can compute L(g, Pn) = n∑ i=1 mi(xi − xi−1) = n∑ i=1[3 (i−1)b n + 7] b n = 3 n−1 n b2 2 + 7b n n∑ i=1 1 = 3 n−1 n b 2 2 + 7b and U (g, Pn) = n∑ i=1 Mi(xi − xi−1) = n∑ i=1[3 ib n + 7] b n = 3 n+1 n b2 2 + 7b n n∑ i=1 1 = 3 n+1 n b 2 2 + 7b, so that U (g, Pn) − L(g, Pn) = 3b2 2 ( n+1 n − n−1 n ) = 3b 2 n = 1,200 n and we can then proceed as above. □ Q2. (a) Calculate the Riemann–Darboux sums L(f, P ) and U (f, P ) for each of the following functions f and partitions P : (i) f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = x2, P = {0, 2, 7, 10} (ii) f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = e−x, P = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10} (iii) f : [0, π] → R, f (x) = sin(x), P = {0, π 2 , 3π 4 , π} (b) Use the Riemann–Darboux sums calculator (Spring Week 1 Materials on Canvas) to visualize and check your answers above (note that 3π 4 is entered as 3*Pi/4). (c) For each of the functions f above, use the Riemann–Darboux sums calculator to calcu- late L(f, Pn) and U (f, Pn) when n = 5, n = 10 and n = 100, where Pn is the partition of the domain of f into n subintervals of equal width. (d) For each δ ∈ (0, 1/10), find an expression for the sums L(f, Pδ) and U (f, Pδ) when f : [−2, 2] → R, f (x) = {5, x ∈ N 3, x /∈ N and Pδ = {−2, 1 − δ, 1 + δ, 2 − δ, 2}. 4 Solution. (a)(i) For f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = x2, P = {0, 2, 7, 10}, we calculate L(f, P ) = ∑3 i=1 mi(xi − xi−1) = 0(2 − 0) + 4(7 − 2) + 49(10 − 7) = 167 and U (f, P ) = ∑3 i=1 Mi(xi − xi−1) = 4(2 − 0) + 49(7 − 2) + 100(10 − 7) = 553. (a)(ii) For f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = e−x, P = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10}, we calculate L(f, P ) = ∑5 i=1 mi(xi − xi−1) = e−1(1 − 0) + e −5(5 − 1) + e−8(8 − 5) + e−9(9 − 8) + e−10(10 − 9) = e−1 + 4e−5 + 3e−8 + e−9 + e −10 and U (f, P ) = ∑5 i=1 Mi(xi − xi−1) = e−0(1 − 0) + e−1(5 − 1) + e−5(8 − 5) + e−8(9 − 8) + e−9(10 − 9) = 1 + 4e−1 + 3e−5 + e−8 + e−9. (a)(iii) For f : [0, π] → R, f (x) = sin(x), P = {0, π 2 , 3π 4 , π}, we calculate L(f, P ) = ∑3 i=1 mi(xi − xi−1) = sin(0)( π 2 − 0) + sin( 3π 4 )( 3π 4 − π 2 ) + sin(π)(π − 3π 4 ) = √2 2 π 4 and U (f, P ) = ∑3 i=1 Mi(xi − xi−1) = sin( π 2 )( π 2 − 0) + sin( π 2 )( 3π 4 − π 2 ) + sin( 3π 4 )(π − 3π 4 ) = π 2 + π 4 + √2 2 π 4 = (3 + √2 2 ) π 4 . (b)(i) For f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = x2, P = {0, 2, 7, 10}, the Riemann–Darboux Sums Calculator depicts the areas covered by L(f, P ) and U (f, P ) in Figure 2 below. 5 Figure 2. Two graphs of f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = x2, showing the areas covered by L(f, P ) and U (f, P ) for P = {0, 2, 7, 10}. (b)(ii) For f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = e−x, P = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10}, the Riemann–Darboux Sums Calculator depicts the areas covered by L(f, P ) and U (f, P ) in Figure 3 below. Figure 3. Two graphs of f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = e−x, showing the areas covered by L(f, P ) and U (f, P ) for P = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10}. (b)(iii) For f : [0, π] → R, f (x) = sin(x), P = {0, π 2 , 3π 4 , π}, the Riemann–Darboux Sums Calculator depicts the areas covered by L(f, P ) and U (f, P ) in Figure 4 below. 6 Figure 4. Two graphs of f : [0, π] → R, f (x) = sin(x), showing the areas covered by L(f, P ) and U (f, P ) for P = {0, π 2 , 3π 4 , π}. (c) Table 1 shows the values (correct to three decimal places) for L(f, Pn) and U (f, Pn) when n = 5, n = 10 and n = 100 for each function f from part (a). These values were found using the Riemann–Darboux Sums Calculator: L(f, P5) L(f, P10) L(f, P100) Area U (f, P100) U (f, P10) U (f, P5) (i) 240 285 328.35 333.333 338.35 385 440 (ii) 0.313 0.582 0.951 1.000 1.051 1.582 2.313 (iii) 1.336 1.669 1.968 2 2.030 2.298 2.193 Table 1. The values of L(f, Pn) and U (f, Pn) when n = 5, n = 10 and n = 100 for each function f from part (a). (d) For f : [−2, 2] → R, f (x) = {5, x ∈ N 3, x /∈ N and Pδ = {−2, 1 − δ, 1 + δ, 2 − δ, 2}, we calculate L(f, Pδ) = ∑4 i=1 mi(xi − xi−1) = 3(3 − δ) + 3(2δ) + 3(1 − 2δ) + 3(δ) = 12 and U (f, Pδ) = ∑4 i=1 Mi(xi − xi−1) = 3(3 − δ) + 5(2δ) + 3(1 − 2δ) + 5(δ) = 12 + 6δ for each δ ∈ (0, 1/10). □ 7 Q3. It is proved in Lecture 2.1 of the Integration Lecture Notes that if f : [a, b] → [0, ∞) is a bounded function, where −∞ < a < b < ∞, and P , Q are partitions of [a, b] such that P ⊆ Q, then L(f, P ) ≤ L(f, Q). List the changes that are needed to prove that U (f, P ) ≥ U (f, Q), and in particular, explain how the inequalities m1 ≤ m ′ 1 and m1 ≤ m ′′ 1 need to be modified. Solution. We follow the same procedure as in the Lecture Notes, except instead of consid- ering the quantities m1, m ′ 1, and m ′′ 1 , we introduce M1 := sup{f (x) : x ∈ [x0, x1]}, M ′ 1 := sup{f (x) : x ∈ [x0, y]}, M ′′ 1 := sup{f (x) : x ∈ [y, x1]}. The inequalities m1 ≤ m ′ 1 and m1 ≤ m ′′ 1 are then reversed in that M1 ≥ M ′ 1 and M1 ≥ M ′′ 1 to obtain M1(x1 − x0) ≥ M ′ 1(y − x0) + M ′′ 1 (x1 − y) and thus ultimately U (f, P ) ≥ U (f, Q). □ Q4. Let f : [0, b] → [0, ∞) be defined by f (x) = x2, where b ∈ (0, ∞): (a) For each n ∈ N, let Pn = {xi : i = 0, 1, . . . , n} denote the partition of [0, b] into n subintervals of equal width. Express xi in terms of i and b. (b) Use the formula ∑k j=1 j2 = 1 6 k(k + 1)(2k + 1) to prove that L(f, Pn) = b 3 6n3 (n − 1)n(2n − 1) and U (f, Pn) = b3 6n3 n(n + 1)(2n + 1). (c) Find, with proof, the values sup{L(f, Pn) : n ∈ N} and inf{U (f, Pn) : n ∈ N}. (d) Find, with proof, the lower integral ∫ b 0 f and the upper integral ∫ b 0 f . (e) Prove that f is bounded and integrable, then find ∫ b 0 f (without using calculus). Solution. (a) For each n ∈ N, we have Pn = {0, b n , 2b n , . . . , (n−1)b n , 1} = { ib n : i = 0, 1, . . . , n}, so xi = ib n for each i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}. (b) For each i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}, we have mi = inf{x2 : x ∈ [ (i−1)b n , ib n ]} = ( (i−1)b n )2 , Mi = sup{x2 : x ∈ [ (i−1)b n , ib n ]} = ( ib n )2 . We use these to obtain L(f, Pn) = ∑n i=1 mi(xi − xi−1) = ∑n i=1 ( (i−1)b n )2 b n = b3 n3 ∑n−1 j=0 j2 = b3 n3 ∑n−1 j=1 j2 = b 3 6n3 (n − 1)n(2n − 1), 8 where we used the given sum with k = n − 1 in the penultimate equality, and U (f, Pn) = ∑n i=1 Mi(xi − xi−1) = ∑n i=1 ( ib n )2 b n = b3 n3 ∑n i=1 i2 = b3 6n3 (n + 1)n(2n + 1), where we used the given sum with k = n in the penultimate equality. (c) We can now calculate sup{L(f, Pn) : n ∈ N} = sup{ b 3 6 (2 − 3 n + 1 n2 ) : n ∈ N} = b3 3 and inf{U (f, Pn) : n ∈ N} = inf{ b3 6 (2 + 3 n + 1 n2 ) : n ∈ N} = b3 3 . To prove these facts, it suffices to observe that an := b3 6 (2 − 3 n + 1 n2 ) is an increasing sequence with limn→∞ an = b3 3 , whilst bn := b3 6 (2 + 3 n + 1 n2 ) is a decreasing sequence with limit limn→∞ bn = b3 3 . (d) Now, as {L(f, Pn) : n ∈ N} ⊆ {L(f, P ) : P is a partition of [0, b]}, we have ∫ b 0 f := sup P L(f, P ) ≥ sup n∈N L(f, Pn) = b3 3 . Moreover, as {U (f, Pn) : n ∈ N} ⊆ {U (f, P ) : P is a partition of [0, b]}, we have ∫ b 0 f := inf P U (f, P ) ≤ inf n∈N U (f, Pn) = b3 3 . We also know from Proposition 2.2.2 in the Lecture Notes that the lower integrals is always less than or equal to the upper integral, hence b3 3 ≤ ∫ b 0 f ≤ ∫ b 0 f ≤ b3 3 , which implies that b3 3 = ∫ b 0 f = ∫ b 0 f = b 3 3 . (e) The preceding equality proves that f is integrable with ∫ b 0 f = b3 6 . □ Extra Questions EQ1. (a) Find, with proof, the infimum and supremum of each of the following sets: (i) A = (0, 1] ∪ (2, 3] (ii) B = {x2 − 4x + 5 : x ∈ (1, 3]} (iii) C = {(2n + 3)/n : n ∈ N} (iv) D = {n2 − 6n + 10 : n ∈ N} (b) Let X denote a nonempty bounded subset of R. Prove that for each ϵ > 0, there exists x in X such that inf X ≤ x < inf X + ϵ. EQ2. For each n ∈ N, let Pn denote the partition of [0, 1] into n subintervals of equal width. Find an expression, possibly involving summation notation, for the sums L(f, Pn) and U (f, Pn) for f : [0, 1] → R in each of the following cases: (a) f (x) = x2 + x (b) f (x) = cos(x) 9 (c) f (x) = { 5, x ∈ Q 3, x /∈ Q (d) f (x) = { 1, x ∈ {0, 1}, 0, x /∈ {0, 1}. EQ3. Let P1 denote a partition of [a, b] and P2 = P1 ∪ {c}, where −∞ < a < c < b < ∞. Use results from lectures to prove that U (f, P2) − L(f, P2) ≤ U (f, P1) − L(f, P1). EQ4. Let f : [a, b] → R be defined by f (x) = x3, where 0 ≤ a < b < ∞. Use the procedure outlined in Q4 and the formula ∑k j=1 j3 = 1 4 k4 + 1 2 k3 + 1 4 k2 to prove that f is integrable with ∫ b a f = 1 4 b4 − 1 4 a 4.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
