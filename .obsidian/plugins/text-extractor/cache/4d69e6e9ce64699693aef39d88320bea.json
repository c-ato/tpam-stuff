Model solutions will only be released for the Questions (Q1–Q4). Questions Q1. (a) State the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. (b) Use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to prove that each of the following functions is differentiable and find its derivative in terms of elementary functions: (i) F : [3, 5] → R, F (x) := ∫ x 2 3t2t dt, x ∈ [3, 5] (ii) G : (π, 2π) → R, G(x) := ∫ 3 sin 2(x)+1 1 e−t t dt, x ∈ (π, 2π) (iii) H : [0, 1 10 ] → R, H(x) := ∫ 2x x √1 − 9t2 √1 − t2 dt, x ∈ [0, 1 10 ] Solution. (a) The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is stated below. This is Theorem 5.1.1 in the Lecture Notes. It is good practice, although not essential, to use a theorem environment to express the result. Theorem. Let f : [a, b] → R denote a bounded integrable function and suppose that F : [a, b] → R is given by F (x) := ∫ x a f for all x ∈ [a, b]. If f is continuous at c, where c ∈ [a, b], then F is differentiable at c with derivative F ′(c) = f (c). (b)(i) Let f : [2, 4] → R be given by f (x) := 3x2x for all x ∈ [2, 5]. This is a continu- ous function because the exponential function is continuous on R. The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus applies at each point c in the interval [3, 5], because f is continuous at each such point, so F is differentiable with F ′(x) = f (x) = 3x2x for all x ∈ [3, 5]. (b)(ii) Let f : [1, 4] → R be given by f (x) := e−x/x for all x ∈ [1, 4]. The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus does not apply directly here because 3 sin 2(x)+1 appears in upper endpoint of the integral. Instead, let F : [1, 4] → R be given by F (x) := ∫ x 1 e−t t dt = ∫ x 1 f (t) dt for all x ∈ [1, 4]. The function f is continuous, since it is the quotient of an exponential function and a nonzero polynomial on the interval [1, 4], so the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus implies that F is differentiable with F ′(x) = f (x) = e−x/x for all x ∈ [1, 4]. Next, let g : (π, 2π) → R be given by g(x) := 3 sin2(x)+1 for all x ∈ (π, 2π). The function g is differentiable with derivative g′(x) = 6 sin(x) cos(x) for all x ∈ (π, 2π). Moreover, 1 2 we have G = F ◦ g, where F is also differentiable, so the Chain Rule implies that G is differentiable with derivative G ′(x) = (F ◦ g) ′(x) = F ′(g(x))g′(x) = e−(g(x)) g(x) (6 sin(x) cos(x)) = e−(3 sin2(x)+1) 3 sin 2(x) + 1 (6 sin(x) cos(x)) for all x ∈ (π, 2π). (b)(iii) Let f : [0, 1 5 ] → R be given by f (x) := √1 − 9x2/√1 − x2 for all x ∈ [0, 1 5 ]. The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus does not apply directly here because the variable x appears in the lower endpoint of the integral. Instead, let F : [0, 1 5 ] → R be given by F (x) := ∫ x 0 √1 − 9t2 √1 − t2 dt = ∫ x 0 f (t) dt for all x ∈ [0, 1 5 ]. The function f is continuous, since the square-root function is continuous on [0, ∞) and the polynomials in the definition of f are positive on [0, 1 5 ], so the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus implies that F is differentiable with F ′(x) = f (x) = √1 − 9x2/√1 − x2 for all x ∈ [0, 1 5 ]. Next, we use the restriction and extension properties of the integral in Theorem 4.2.1 of the Lecture Notes to write H(x) = ∫ 2x x √1 − 9t2 √1 − t2 dt = ∫ 2x 0 √1 − 9t2 √1 − t2 dt − ∫ x 0 √1 − 9t2 √1 − t2 dt = F (2x) − F (x) for all x ∈ [0, 1 10 ]. The linearity of derivatives and the Chain Rule thus imply that H is differentiable with H ′(x) = F ′(2x)(2x) ′ − F ′(x) = 2 √ 1 − 9(2x)2 √1 − (2x)2 − √1 − 9x2 √1 − x2 = 2 √1 − 36x2 √1 − 4x2 − √1 − 9x2 √1 − x2 for all x ∈ [0, 1 10 ]. □ Q2. (a) State the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. (b) Suppose that −∞ < a < b < ∞. Use the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to prove that ∫ b a |x| dx =    1 2 (b2 − a2), a ≥ 0; 1 2 (a 2 + b2), a < 0 ≤ b; 1 2 (a 2 − b2), b < 0. You must verify all hypotheses required to apply the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In particular, if you use the fact that a certain function is an antideriva- tive of the absolute value function, then you must prove this fact (be careful proving differentiability at the origin). 3 (c) Let f : R \\ [−3, −2] → R be defined by f (x) := |x| for all x ∈ R \\ [−3, −2]. Find two antiderivatives F1 and F2 of f such that F1(x) − F2(x) = { 9, x > −2; 3, x < −3. You must prove that your choices for F1 and F2 are antiderivatives of f . Solution. (a) The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is stated below. It is good practice, although not essential, to use a theorem environment to express the result. Theorem. If f : [a, b] → R is a bounded integrable function, and there exists a differentiable function g : [a, b] → R such that f = g′, then ∫ b a f = g(b) − g(a). (b) The function f : [a, b] → R given by f (x) := |x| for all x ∈ [a, b] is continuous, hence it is integrable by Theorem 4.1.5 in the Lecture Notes. An antiderivative of f is any differentiable function g such that f = g′. We claim that g : [a, b] → R given by g(x) := { 1 2 x2, if x ≥ 0; − 1 2 x2, if x < 0, is differentiable with g′(x) = |x| = f (x) for all x ∈ [a, b]. To prove this, we consider the following three cases: • If a ≥ 0, then g(x) = 1 2 x2 for all x ∈ [a, b], so g is a polynomial around each point in its domain, and which is differentiable with derivative g′(x) = x = |x| for all x ∈ [a, b]. • If b < 0, then g(x) = − 1 2 x2 for all x ∈ [a, b], so g is a polynomial around each point in its domain, and which is differentiable with derivative g′(x) = −x = |x| for all x ∈ [a, b]. • If a < 0 ≤ b, then g is differentiable on [a, 0) and on (0, b] as in the above two cases. We must check if it is differentiable at the origin, however, because in this case g is not given by a single polynomial expression in any open interval containing the origin. To do this, we calculate lim h→0+ g(0 + h) − g(0) h = lim h→0+ 1 2 h 2 − 0 h = lim h→0+ 1 2 h = 0 and lim h→0− g(0 + h) − g(0) h = lim h→0− − 1 2 h 2 − 0 h = lim h→0− − 1 2 h = 0. The equality of these limits proves that g is differentiable at 0 with g′(0) := lim h→0 g(0 + h) − g(0) h = 0 = f (0). It is important to recognise here that differentiability away from the origin is immediate from the differentiability of polynomials on R. Around the origin, however, the function g is not given by a single polynomial, so we must instead argue directly using the definition of differentiability. To conclude, since f is integrable, and we have found an antiderivative g (i.e. f = g′), we can apply the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Theorem 5.2.1 in the Lecture Notes) to obtain ∫ b a |x| dx = ∫ b a f = ∫ b a g′ = g(b) − g(a) =    1 2 (b 2 − a 2), a ≥ 0; 1 2 (a 2 + b 2), a < 0 ≤ b; 1 2 (a 2 − b 2), b < 0, as required. (c) Now suppose that f : R\\[−3, −2] → R is defined by f (x) := |x| for all x ∈ R\\[−3, −2]. The domain of f is the set R \\ [−3, −2] = (−∞, −3) ∪ (−2, ∞), which consists of two disconnected intervals (−∞, −3) and (−2, ∞). It is this property which allows us to obtain 4 antiderivatives, F1 and F2, which do not differ by an additive constant. For example, the functions F1 : R \\ [−3, −2] → R defined by F1(x) :=    1 2 x2 + 9, if x ∈ [0, ∞); − 1 2 x2 + 9, if x ∈ (−2, 0); − 1 2 x2 + 3, if x ∈ (−∞, −3), and F2 : R \\ [−3, −2] → R defined by F2(x) :=    1 2 x2, if x ∈ [0, ∞); − 1 2 x2, if x ∈ (−2, 0); − 1 2 x2, if x ∈ (−∞, −3), are both antiderivatives of f with F1(x) − F2(x) = { 9, x > −2; 3, x < −3, as required. In particular, the functions F1 and F2 are both differentiable with F ′ 1 = F ′ 2 = f , as in part (b). It is enough to reference the analogous discussion and computations in part (b) for justification here, but the details are included below for completeness. The functions F1 and F2 are each given by a single polynomial around each point in their domain (−∞, −3) ∪ (−2, ∞), except at the origin. The differentiability of F1 at the origin is proved by computing lim h→0+ F1(0 + h) − F1(0) h = lim h→0+ ( 1 2 h 2 + 9) − 9 h = lim h→0+ 1 2 h = 0 and lim h→0− F1(0 + h) − F1(0) h = lim h→0− (− 1 2 h 2 + 9) − 9 h = lim h→0− − 1 2 h = 0, to deduce that F ′ 1(0) = 0 = f (0). The differentiability of F2 at the origin is proved likewise by computing lim h→0+ F2(0 + h) − F2(0) h = lim h→0+ 1 2 h 2 − 0 h = lim h→0+ 1 2 h = 0 and lim h→0− F1(0 + h) − F1(0) h = lim h→0− − 1 2 h 2 − 0 h = lim h→0− − 1 2 h = 0, to deduce that F ′ 2(0) = 0 = f (0). More generally, we could choose F1(x) :=    1 2 x2 + c1, if x ∈ [0, ∞); − 1 2 x2 + c1, if x ∈ (−2, 0); − 1 2 x2 + c2, if x ∈ (−∞, −3), and F2(x) :=    1 2 x2 + c3, if x ∈ [0, ∞); − 1 2 x2 + c3, if x ∈ (−2, 0); − 1 2 x2 + c4, if x ∈ (−∞, −3), for any real numbers c1, c2, c3 and c4, such that c1 − c3 = 9 and c2 − c4 = 3. □ Q3. Find the following antiderivatives and integrals (henceforth log(x) := loge(x)): (a) ∫ e 1 x2 log(x) dx 5 (b) ∫ (log(x)) 2 dx (c) ∫ π 0 ex cos(x) dx Solution. (a) We apply Integration by Parts with {u(x) = log(x) v(x) = 1 3 x3 and { u′(x) = x−1 v′(x) = x2 to obtain ∫ e 1 x2 log(x) dx = [ 1 3 x3 log(x) ]e 1 − ∫ e 1 x−1( 1 3 x3) dx = 1 3 e3 − 0 − [ 1 9 x3]e 1 = 1 3 e3 − 1 9 e3 + 1 9 = 2 9 e3 + 1 9 . (b) After recalling that ∫ log(x) dx = x(log(x) − 1) by Example 6.1.2 in the Lecture Notes, we apply Integration by Parts with { u(x) = log(x) v(x) = x(log(x) − 1) and { u ′(x) = x−1 v′(x) = log(x) to obtain ∫ (log(x))2 dx = (log(x))x(log(x) − 1) − ∫ x−1x(log(x) − 1) = (log(x))x(log(x) − 1) − ∫ (log(x) − 1) = (log(x))x(log(x) − 1) − x(log(x) − 1) + x = (log(x) − 1)x(log(x) − 1) + x = x(log(x) − 1)2 + x = x(log(x))2 − 2x log(x) + 2x. (c) We apply Integration by Parts twice. First with u(x) = ex and v(x) = sin(x), so u ′(x) = ex and v′(x) = cos(x), to obtain ∫ π 0 ex cos(x) dx = [ex sin(x)] π 0 − ∫ π 0 ex sin(x) dx. Next, with u(x) = ex and v(x) = − cos(x), so u ′(x) = e x and v(x)′ = sin(x), to obtain ∫ π 0 e x sin(x) dx = [−ex cos(x)] π 0 − ∫ π 0 ex(− cos(x)) dx = [−ex cos(x)] π 0 + ∫ π 0 ex cos(x) dx. We combine the previous two identities to obtain ∫ π 0 ex cos(x) dx = [e x sin(x)] π 0 − ([−ex cos(x)] π 0 + ∫ π 0 ex cos(x) dx) , hence ∫ π 0 ex cos(x) dx = 1 2 [ex(sin(x) + cos(x))] π 0 = − 1 2 (eπ + 1). 6 Q4. Find the following antiderivatives and integrals: (a) ∫ x − 4 x2 − 5x + 6 dx (b) ∫ 2 1 x5 + x − 1 x3 + 1 dx (c) ∫ x2 + 2x − 1 x3 − x dx Solution. (a) The integrand is a rational function so we use the method of partial fractions. The denominator x 2 − 5x + 6 = (x − 3)(x − 2) has two linear factors, so the appropriate form of the partial fraction expansion is x − 4 x2 − 5x + 6 = A x − 3 + B x − 2 . After finding a common denominator, we obtain x − 4 = A(x − 2) + B(x − 3) = (A + B)x + (−2A − 3B). We equate the coefficients of both x and x0 to obtain the simultaneous equations A + B = 1 and (−2A − 3B) = −4 with the solution A = −1 and B = 2, hence ∫ x − 4 x2 − 5x + 6 dx = ∫ −1 x − 3 dx + ∫ 2 x − 2 dx = − log |x − 3| + 2 log |x − 2|. (b) The integrand is a rational function so we use the method of partial fractions. The degree of the numerator is larger than degree of the denominator, so we use polynomial long division to obtain x5 + x − 1 x3 + 1 = x 2 + −x 2 + x − 1 x3 + 1 . The denominator x3 + 1 = (x + 1)(x2 − x + 1) has a linear factor and an irreducible quadratic factor, so the appropriate form of the partial fraction expansion is −x2 + x − 1 (x + 1)(x2 − x + 1) = A x + 1 + Bx + C x2 − x + 1 . After finding a common denominator, we obtain −x2 + x − 1 = A(x2 − x + 1) + (Bx + C)(x + 1) = (A + B)x 2 + (−A + B + C)x + (A + C). We equate the coefficients of x2, x and x0 to obtain the simultaneous equations A + B = −1 −A + B + C = 1 A + C = −1 with the solution A = −1, B = 0 and C = 0, hence ∫ 2 1 x5 + x − 1 x3 + 1 dx = ∫ 2 1 x2 dx + ∫ 2 1 −1 x + 1 dx = [ 1 3 x3 − log |x + 1| ]2 1 = 7 3 + log( 2 3 ). (c) The integrand is a rational function so we use the method of partial fractions. The denominator x3 − x = x(x + 1)(x − 1) has three linear factors, so the correct form of the partial fraction decomposition is x2 + 2x − 1 x3 − x = A x + B x + 1 + C x − 1 . 7 After finding a common denominator, we obtain x2 + 2x − 1 = A(x2 − 1) + B(x2 − x) + C(x2 + x) = (A + B + C)x2 + (−B + C)x + (−A). We equate the coefficients of x2, x and x0 to obtain the simultaneous equations A + B + C = 1 −B + C = 2 −A = −1 with the solution A = 1, B = −1 and C = 1, hence ∫ x2 + 2x − 1 x3 − x dx = ∫ 1 x dx + ∫ −1 x + 1 dx + ∫ 1 x − 1 dx = log |x| − log |x + 1| + log |x − 1|.
