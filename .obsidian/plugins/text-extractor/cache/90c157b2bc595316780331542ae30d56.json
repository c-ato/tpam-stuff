P S1 S2 l1 l2 suppose two sound sources S1 and S2 oscillate in phase and emit harmonic waves of the same frequency and wavelength. Now consider at the point P in space for which the path lengths differ.

How many beats will be heard in one second? If 2 forks are sounded together then the number of beats heard will be equal to the difference of their frequencies. But I don't know how to calculate the beat frequency if 3 forks are sounded together. If you sound the 100 together with the 102, you will get a beat frequency of 2 beats/sec on a frequency of 101 Hz. When the 101 Hz is sounded there are no further beats added. So I would say, 2 beats. It is a little more complicated to analyse it by sounding the 100 and 101 first and then adding the 102. But if you pair 100 and 101, you get a 100.5 frequency and with 101 and 102 you get 101.5, each with one beat/sec. These two then beat down to 101 with another beat/sec. The beat frequency ends up 2/sec Now put the space and time components together! a bhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity Radio signal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting - /media/File:Amfm3-en-de.gif Which of the two velocities is higher? If wave speed is independent of frequency In general, wave speed depends on frequency Vphase can be greater or smaller than vGroup If wave speed depends on frequency, the medium is called dispersive. Does sound speed in air depends on frequency? Does speed of light in glass depends on frequency? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlM9vq-bepA http://resource.isvr.soton.ac.uk/spcg/ tutorial/tutorial/Tutorial_files/Web- further-dispersive.htm If you are really into the physics of group and phase velocities: visit: Coherence Two sources that are in phase or have a constant phase difference, are said to be coherent.

(Alexander Graham Bell) 0 dB does not mean zero sound intensity! I is the intensity of the source I0 is a reference level defined as 10-12 W/m2 (approx. threshold of hearing) At threshold of hearing How much is the displacement on the eardrum? 10 -5 m for 120 dB, and 10-11 m for 0 dB. 10 -11 m is smaller than an atom! How to calculate the intensity I?Doppler effect (for sound) If a wave source and receiver are moving relative to each other, the frequency detected by the receiver is different from that emitted by the source. Two scenarios (1) moving source (2) moving observer Source movingDoppler 1) moving source (receiver at rest) Source has frequency: fs (period Ts=1/fs) speed of source: us velocity of waves in medium: v vTs usTs b f Case 2) receiver moving: If moving towards source of the wave, encounters more wave crests per second and thus higher frequency. Speed of receiver: ur. To the receiver, wave with wavelength  appears to travel at v+ur 1 1 sin x( ) 1010 x ur  v If receiver moves away from source Doppler for light (relativity): Doppler shift in freq. depends on if source or receiver is moving relative to the medium. For light, for which there is no medium (propagates in vac), absolute motion cannot be detected; only relative motion of source and receiver can be determined. Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who proposed it in 1842 in Prague. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ File:Redshift.png Shock waves: is what happens when the velocity of the source is faster than the velocity of waves in the medium Speed boat phenomenon u = 0 0 < u < v v: Velocity of sound u: velocity of source u = v Shock wave u > v, supersonic S h o c k w a v e S h o c k w a v e u v ut vt sin Shock wave Mach cone angle:  Mach number=u/v Along the path of the plane, the sound waves produced later are heard first.
