So we should write Note before we had 2 2 22 2 1 t y vxy      So  T v  Wave on a string travels faster at higher T, lower . The speed of mechanical waves has a general form: Speed of sound in a gas: B is the bulk modulus r is the density of the gas T is the absolute temperature R is the ideal gas constant= 8.31J/mol. K g is the ratio of heat capacities, equals Cp/Cv M is the molar mass, in kg/mol. Find the relevant values for air molecules and thus verify that the speed of sound in air at room temperature (293 K) is about 344 m/s Reflection and transmission of waves reflectionhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-e66Ds8rW8 - reflection What happens when light and heavy strings are joined? Consider a travelling wave is incident from the left At the junction of the strings the displacement must be continuous 1 2 x=0 1 1  T v  2 2  T v  x=0 A sharp corner means large curvature. Force is proportional to curvature, so curvature must be finite because force cannot be infinite. ALL wave functions, including transverse, longitudinal, acoustic, EM, satisfy the wave Eq. For waves on a string Mini summary Any wave can be described by a wave function. For sinusoidal waves: The frequency with which the waves travel down the string is the same for both parts (depends on the frequency with which the waves are generated) So this is not really a solution! i.e. cannot satisfy the boundary conditions in this way. Need to consider a transmitted wave in medium 2 (heavy string) a reflected wave in medium 1 (light string) x=0 incident reflected transmitted y1 y2 Incident Wave: Transmitted Wave: Reflected Wave: k1: wave number in the medium where the incident wave comes from; k2: wave number in the medium where the transmitted wave goes into. negative is then and left thefrom comes wave theif :Note 12 12 C kk    T k T k v       A kk kk C 21 21    1 2 x=0 positive is then and right thefrom comes wave theIf 21 21 C kk    1 2 x=0 2 1 If the second string is massless then k2= 0 and C = A. “massless” is another way to say that the second string does not exist, so the first string has a “free” end. T k T k v       if the second string has infinite mass then k2 =  and C = –A. Infinite mass is another way to say that the end of the first string is fixed and hence unable to move. What happens at the ends of the string? reflection of waves 1 20 x=0 If k1 and k2 are the same, then there is no reflection. Different k means different velocity because frequency is the same. When light is incident onto an air-glass interface, reflection takes place in a similar manner. Reflection Incident light Transmitted light/refraction","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
