Introduction to Data Analysis and Error HandlingThe expectation value of a function f (x), where x comes from the probability distribution p(x), is deﬁned by E[ f (x)] = ∫ b a f (x)p(x)dx. The mean of the distribution is the expectation value of x, µ = E[ x] = ∫ b a xp(x)dx. The variance, σ2, a measure of the spread of the distribution, is the expectation value of (x − µ)2, the squared distance of x from the mean µ, σ2 = E[ (x − µ)2] = ∫ b a (x − µ)2p(x)dx. σ is known as the standard deviation. From the linearity property of expectation values, E[ c1f (x) + c2g(x)] = c1E[ f (x)] + c2E[ g(x)] , it follows that σ2 = E[ x2 − 2µx + µ2] = E[ x2] − 2µE[ x] + µ2E[ 1] = E[ x2] − µ2 = E[ x2] − E[ x]2. Sample Mean and Variance It follows that E[ Median and ModeExercise 1: An optical system measures length by counting electronically the number of light fringes passing a slit.
