Understand the conditions for maximum power transfer to an external circuit by a practical generator. 2. Quote Thevenin’s theorem and understand how to derive the Thevenin’s equivalent circuit. 3. Apply Thevenin’s theorem in order to simplify the analysis of complex networks when only the current in part of the circuit (usually the load) is required.
