In the later case it was the principle that time is the same in all inertial frames that had to be abandoned. Albert Einstein proposed to give up (or rather modify) Galilean transformation and its idea of universal time. He argued that in order to measure time in diﬀerent locations we need to use a procedure of clock synchronisation. This is only possible by sending information about clocks in these locations. The universal time would only make sense if the information had travelled inﬁnitely fast, i.e. instantaneously. This is not the case. The maximum speed of information propagation is speed of light c, and it has to be the same at every point in space. The following two statements were proposed as postulates of special relativity: ˜ ˚ ˝ ˛ 1. All inertial frames are equivalent to all laws of physics. 2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same (invari- ant) in all inertial frames. Thus a new transformation law of coordinates and time must replace Galilean Trans- formation law. This new transformation should lead to a new law of velocity composition preserving the speed of light. Dutch scientist Hendrik Lorentz discovered such transformations even before Einstein formulated his postulates, by studying Maxwell equations. These transformations are known to us as Lorentz transformations, even though they were formulated in the ﬁnal form by French mathematician Henri Poincar´e. Below we will derive them by exploiting idea of simaltaneity. Imagine three equidistant points, A, B, C which are at rest in some inertial frame K. We send a signal (light) from B towards A and C. The signal arrives to these points at the same time, i.e. simultaneously, as shown graphically in Fig. . Figure 1: Left: light arrives to points A and C at the same time in stationary frame K. Right: for points A,B, C moving with constant velocity v the light from B arrives to points A and C at diﬀerent times tA < tC. Galilean transformation to the moving frame K ′ in which all points are at rest predicts t ′ A < t ′ C as well. Now imagine that the system of three points A, B, C is moving in the pos- itive x-direction with ve- locity v. The light start- ing in B at t = 0 ar- rives to point A earlier than to point C as shown in Fig. . Of course this is expected. What is not expected is that in the moving frame K′ in which the points are stationary the Galilean transforma- tion also predicts t′ A < t′ C. Indeed, from the point of view of an observer moving with B, the light should reach the points A and C at the same time! Thus something must be done to the way time is DM Gangardt 1 University of Birmingham SR Lecture 03 Einstein postulates of special relativity and Lorentz transformations transformed so that the transformation predicts t′ A = t′ C. Graphically this means that the line t′ = t′ A = t′ C must be parallel to to the new ˆx′-axis, so the latter must be tilted as shown in a modiﬁed diagram Fig. 2 We see that simultaneity is relative notion and depends on the frame chosen. Of course it contradicts the universal time t′ = t of Galilean transformation. Therefore we are led to a general transformation which includes both space and time, x = ax ′ + bt ′ (1) t = f x ′ + gt ′ , (2) where the coeﬃcient a, b, f, g depend on velocity v. To ﬁnd these coeﬃcients we note ﬁrst, that the trajectory of the origin of K, x = 0 Figure 2: In order to make the times of arrival to points A and C equal in the moving frame, t ′ A = t′ C, the ˆx′-axis must be tilted. for any t, corresponds to x′ = −vt′, i.e. viewed from the moving frame K′ the origin moves to the left with velocity v. This gives the relation: b = av . Next we look at the trajectory of a light beam starting from the origin at time t = t′ = 0. We have in both frames: x = ct , x′ = ct ′ (3) These equations can be rewritten using the transformation (1) as ct = x = ax ′ + bt′ = act ′ + avt ′ = a(c + v)t ′ ct ′ = x ′ = a(c − v)t , where the last equation follows from the fact that the inverse transformation (from K′ to K) can be obtained simply by changing (x, t) → (x′, t′) and v → −v. We have ct = a(c + v)t ′ = a(c + v)(c − v)t/c ⇒ a 2 = c2 c2 − v2 . It is clear that a > 0, so the ﬁrst line of Lorentz transformation is x = x′ + vt′ √ 1 − v2/c2 = γ(v)(x′ + vt ′) , (4) where we renamed the relativistic factor γ(v) = a = 1/√ 1 − v2/c2. To ﬁnd the second line of Lorentz transformation we use x′ = ax − bt so that t = ax − x′ b = (a2 − 1)x′ + abt′ b = √ 1 − v2/c2 v ( 1 1 − v2/c2 − 1 ) x ′ + t′ √ 1 − v2/c2 = vx′/c2 √ 1 − v2/c2 + t′ √ 1 − v2/c2 = t′ + vx′/c2 √1 − v2/c2 = γ(v)(t′ + vx ′/c 2) . DM Gangardt 2 University of Birmingham SR Lecture 03 Einstein postulates of special relativity and Lorentz transformations This provides the second line of Lorentz transformation. The coordinates perpendicular to the direction of motion are unaﬀected: y = y′ , z = z′ . By changing (x, t) → (x′, t′) and v → −v we get the inverse transformation1 x′ = x − vt √ 1 − v2/c2 = γ(v)(x − vt) t′ = t − vx/c2 √ 1 − v2/c2 = γ(v)(t − vx/c 2) . We see that for v/c → 0 Lorentz transformations reduce to Galilean transformations, in particular t′ = t. 1We used the convention that the primed frame K ′ moves in positive x direction with respect to K. In this case a simple rule can be used to memorise the signs in Lorentz transformation: “either prime or minus” (V.I. Nikolaev, professor of physics at Moscow State University who taught me in my ﬁrst year there). DM Gangardt 3 University of Birmingham","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
