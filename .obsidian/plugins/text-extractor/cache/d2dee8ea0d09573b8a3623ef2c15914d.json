We want to know the potential energy per unit length of this cylinder of charge as measured from a radial distance R > a from the cylinder. You are asked to compute this in two ways (and they should give the same answer!) Method 1. You can compute the electrostatic energy by computing the work that is needed to build up the cylinder step by step, from a distance R, in this case by bringing in cylindrical shells of charge ∆q with the same density. 1. Consider ﬁrst the set up at an intermediate stage when you have already built a cylinder with a radius r < a, and charge density ρ. (a) What is the electric ﬁeld E of this cylinder at radius x > r? Express the result as a function of x and ρ. [1] (b) What is the work, ∆W , done in bringing charge ∆q from a radius R > r down to the radius r? [2] 2. As we build up the cylinder in steps, using cylindrical shells of inﬁnitesimal width δr and length ℓ, write down an expression for ∆q in terms of r, δr, ℓ and ρ. [1] 3. Compute now the total work per unit length done in building up the full cylinder of radius a by integrating the work ∆W . [3] You may use the following integral result: ∫ A 0 x3 ln B x dx = A 4 16 + A 4 4 ln B A Method 2. You should obtain the same result if you compute the energy per unit length by applying the known result that the energy density of the electrostatic ﬁeld is dU dV = 1 2ϵ0 E2 . 6. Compute the energy per unit length uins inside the cylinder. [2] 7. Compute the energy per unit length uext external to the cylinder up to a radius R > r. [1] You should ﬁnd that uins + uext is equal to the result of point (3). If it isn’t, check your work.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
