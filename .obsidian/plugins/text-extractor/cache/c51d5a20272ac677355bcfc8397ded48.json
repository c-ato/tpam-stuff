Model solutions will only be released for questions Q1-Q4. Q1. (a) Suppose that X ⊆ R is not empty and that N ∈ R is an upper bound for X. Prove that if for each ϵ > 0, there exists x in X such that N − ϵ < x, then N = sup X. (b) Find, with proof, the infimum of the set A := {x : 3 < |x − 2| < 5} (c) Suppose that P = {0, 4, 12, 17, 20} and g : [0, 20] → R is given by g(x) := 3x + 7. (i) Calculate the Riemann–Darboux sums L(g, P ) and U (g, P ). (ii) For each n ∈ N, let Pn denote the partition of [0, 20] into n subintervals of equal width. Find a natural number N such that U (g, PN ) − L(g, PN ) < 1 1,000 . The Riemann–Darboux sums calculator (Spring Week 1 Materials on Canvas) may be helpful in part (c). Q2. (a) Calculate the Riemann–Darboux sums L(f, P ) and U (f, P ) for each of the following functions f and partitions P : (i) f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = x2, P = {0, 2, 7, 10} (ii) f : [0, 10] → R, f (x) = e−x, P = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10} (iii) f : [0, π] → R, f (x) = sin(x), P = {0, π 2 , 3π 4 , π} (b) Use the Riemann–Darboux sums calculator (Spring Week 1 Materials on Canvas) to visualize and check your answers above (note that 3π 4 is entered as 3*Pi/4). (c) For each of the functions f above, use the Riemann–Darboux sums calculator to calcu- late L(f, Pn) and U (f, Pn) when n = 5, n = 10 and n = 100, where Pn is the partition of the domain of f into n subintervals of equal width. (d) For each δ ∈ (0, 1/10), find an expression for the sums L(f, Pδ) and U (f, Pδ) when f : [−2, 2] → R, f (x) = { 5, x ∈ N 3, x /∈ N and Pδ = {−2, 1 − δ, 1 + δ, 2 − δ, 2}. Q3. It is proved in Lecture 2.1 of the Integration Lecture Notes that if f : [a, b] → [0, ∞) is a bounded function, where −∞ < a < b < ∞, and P , Q are partitions of [a, b] such that P ⊆ Q, then L(f, P ) ≤ L(f, Q). List the changes that are needed to prove that U (f, P ) ≥ U (f, Q), and in particular, explain how the inequalities m1 ≤ m ′ 1 and m1 ≤ m ′′ 1 need to be modified. 1 2 Q4. Let f : [0, b] → [0, ∞) be defined by f (x) = x2, where b ∈ (0, ∞): (a) For each n ∈ N, let Pn = {xi : i = 0, 1, . . . , n} denote the partition of [0, b] into n subintervals of equal width. Express xi in terms of i and b. (b) Use the formula ∑k j=1 j2 = 1 6 k(k + 1)(2k + 1) to prove that L(f, Pn) = b3 6n3 (n − 1)n(2n − 1) and U (f, Pn) = b 3 6n3 n(n + 1)(2n + 1). (c) Find, with proof, the values sup{L(f, Pn) : n ∈ N} and inf{U (f, Pn) : n ∈ N}. (d) Find, with proof, the lower integral ∫ b 0 f and the upper integral ∫ b 0 f . (e) Prove that f is bounded and integrable, then find ∫ b 0 f (without using calculus). Extra Questions EQ1.

Prove that for each ϵ > 0, there exists x in X such that inf X ≤ x < inf X + ϵ. EQ2. For each n ∈ N, let Pn denote the partition of [0, 1] into n subintervals of equal width. Find an expression, possibly involving summation notation, for the sums L(f, Pn) and U (f, Pn) for f : [0, 1] → R in each of the following cases: (a) f (x) = x2 + x (b) f (x) = cos(x) (c) f (x) = {5, x ∈ Q 3, x /∈ Q (d) f (x) = {1, x ∈ {0, 1}, 0, x /∈ {0, 1}. EQ3. Let P1 denote a partition of [a, b] and P2 = P1 ∪ {c}, where −∞ < a < c < b < ∞. Use results from lectures to prove that U (f, P2) − L(f, P2) ≤ U (f, P1) − L(f, P1). EQ4. Let f : [a, b] → R be defined by f (x) = x3, where 0 ≤ a < b < ∞. Use the procedure outlined in Q4 and the formula ∑k j=1 j3 = 1 4 k4 + 1 2 k3 + 1 4 k2 to prove that f is integrable with ∫ b a f = 1 4 b 4 − 1 4 a4.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
