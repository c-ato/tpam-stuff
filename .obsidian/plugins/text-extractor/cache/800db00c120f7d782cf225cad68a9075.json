Common lab X-ray sources: Cu: Kα = 1.54 Å Kβ = 1.39 Å (In fact, as always in atomic physics, there is more complexity and another splitting and the Kα is actually two lines, Kα1 and Kα2 very close together..) So if use this for crystallography, every peak from a crystal’s d-spacing becomes 2: Commonly use a filter to remove the Kα2 Mo Kα = 0.7 Å (this wavelength isn’t absorbed by diamonds!) 6 Mo X-Ray spectra 1 angstrom (Å) = 0.1 nm (useful unit for crystal structures) 7 Absorption Edges 8 Moseley’s Law","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
