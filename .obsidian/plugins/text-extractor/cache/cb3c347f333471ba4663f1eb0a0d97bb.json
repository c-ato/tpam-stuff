A space telescope is monitoring a very faint star. The telescope counts the photons that it receives from that star only and there is no background noise. In a single 5 minute exposure, the telescope detects 7 photons. 1.1 Part 1 State which distribution is most appropriate for modelling the photons recieved by the telescope. [1 Mark] 1.2 Part 2 State the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution and deine the variables. Using the same notation state the mean and the variance of the Poisson distribution. [3 Marks] 1.3 Part 3 Calculate the probability of detecting 7 photons assuming the mean number of expected events is[2 Marks] 1.4 Part 4 Calculate the probability of detecting 7 photons assuming the mean number of expected events is[1 Mark] 1.5 Part 5 State, and justfy you answer, which number of mean events (5 or 12) is more likely to be observed in subsequent 5 minute exposures. [1 Mark] (you should assume that the faint star is not a variable star) Estimate the most likely number of photons detected in further observations. [2 Marks] 1 Special Relativity Assessed problem 2 Two spaceships have their velocities v = (vx, vy) = (−u, 0) and w = (wx, wy) = (u, u) in some reference frame Σ. Only the relevant x− and y− components are used. The velocity u = c/2. Calculate the velocities v′ = (v′ x, v′ y) and w′ = (w′ x, w′ y) in the reference frame Σ ′ moving in the x−direction in which the second spaceship moves vertically, w′ x = 0.
