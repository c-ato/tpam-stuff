First we illus- trate the intimate connection between Z3-symmetric “spin” chains and one-dimensional parafermion lattice models, highlighting how the latter host a topological phase featuring protected edge zero modes. We then tour several blueprints for the laboratory realization of parafermion zero modes— focusing on quantum Hall/superconductor hybrids, quantum Hall bilayers, and two-dimensional topological insulators—and describe striking experimental ﬁngerprints that they provide. Finally, we discuss how coupled parafermion arrays in quantum Hall architectures yield topological phases that potentially furnish hardware for a universal, intrinsically decoherence-free quantum computer. I. INTRODUCTION The theoretical and experimental search for topologi- cally nontrivial condensed-matter systems with fraction- alized excitations continues to attract widespread at- tention. One reason for the excitement is fundamen- tal, as fractionalization brilliantly illustrates the rich emergent long-distance behavior that many-body sys- tems can exhibit. Another reason is more practical: certain ‘non-Abelian’ fractionalized excitations form the bedrock of topological quantum computers that tantaliz- ingly promise inherent immunity against errors1,2. Although fractionalized topological phases appear quite exotic, several fundamental examples of such states share a profound relationship with the very well known Ising quantum spin chain. One facet of this relationship arises from the Jordan-Wigner transformation, a non- local map between the bosonic Ising spins and fermions. While this mapping has long been known to provide a useful tool for solving the two-dimensional classical Ising model and its quantum-chain limit3,4, great insights arise by treating the fermions themselves as physical degrees of freedom. With the latter viewpoint the quantum Ising chain corresponds to an electronic model for a one- dimensional (1D) p-wave superconductor. Remarkably, conventional spin ordering for the Ising chain yields a topological superconducting phase in fermionic language. 5 The degenerate ‘up’ and ‘down’ or- dered spin conﬁgurations of the former translate into even- and odd-fermion-parity superconducting states. However, the degeneracy in the latter is resilient; a local magnetic ﬁeld that readily splits the energy of the spin polarizations becomes non-local in fermionic language. The p-wave superconductor thus exhibits a ground-state degeneracy immune to physical perturbations—one of the hallmarks of a topological phase. Because of their inherent robustness, the supercon- ducting ground states can encode fault-tolerant ‘topo- logical qubits’. The qubits arise from Majorana zero modes that bind to the superconductor’s edges.5 (Zero modes in the Ising spin chain with open boundary con- ditions were found long ago 6, but their topological sig- niﬁcance not appreciated until Kitaev’s seminal work.) More interestingly still, the superconductor supports the remarkable phenomenon of non-Abelian exchange statis- tics; that is, swapping pairs of zero modes rotates the sys- tem’s quantum state—and hence the topological qubits— in exquisitely precise ways. 7–9 These highly attractive properties have inspired enormous activity; recent re- views of this fast-moving ﬁeld appear in Refs. 10–15. The close connection between spin systems and topo- logical phases extends in interesting and often sur- prising ways to ‘clock models’ with Zn symmetry16. These models admit a non-local mapping to chains of parafermions that comprise Zn generalizations of Majo- rana operators17. Our goal here is to review the fan- tastically rich physics that has emerged through recent studies of these more exotic objects. In many ways the story parallels the Ising/Majorana problem highlighted above, but certainly not trivially so; throughout we will encounter numerous features unique to parafermions. An immediately glaring distinction is that all of condensed matter arises from conventional bosons and fermions, so that explorations of parafermions might naively seem purely academic. We stress that this is far from the case. A substantial fraction of our discus- sion will survey plausible experimental routes to trap- ping parafermionic excitations even in well understood, presently available systems. Although more challenging to implement, these platforms give rise to topological qubits that are both better protected against environ- mental noise and allow for richer fault-tolerant qubit ro- tations compared to Majorana-based architectures. In fact we will eventually describe methods for leveraging systems with parafermions to synthesize fully universal topological quantum computing hardware!arXiv:1504.02476v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 9 Apr 2015 2 II. PARAFERMIONS IN CHAINS In this section we review the basics of spin chains with Z3 symmetry and their description in terms of parafermions. While some of the analysis straightfor- wardly generalizes the Z2 Ising/Majorana case, we high- light several facets not present there. Our discussion both lays the groundwork for the novel experimental propos- als discussed in subsequent sections and also illuminates several problems of more formal interest. A. Lattice parafermions Clock models provide a natural Zn-symmetric gener- alization of the Ising model. They exhibit similar or- dered and disordered phases, and also admit a non-local representation wherein symmetry-breaking states map to topological phases supporting local zero modes 16. Addi- tionally, for n > 2 a variety of interesting behavior not present in the n = 2 Ising case emerges, especially when the interactions are chiral18–21. The corresponding topo- logical phases have been classiﬁed 22,23. We focus primarily on the 1D three-state clock model since it contains almost all the physics of interest. The Hilbert space consists of a three-state “spin” on each site. The usual Pauli matrices σz and σx respectively gener- alize to σ and τ , deﬁned by σ =  1 ω ω2   , τ =   1 1 1   , ω = ei2π/3. (1) Then the “clock” operator σa = 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 ⊗ σ ⊗ 1 . . . measures the spin on site a, while the “shift” operator τa = 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 ⊗ τ ⊗ 1 . . . winds its value by ω. These operators obey the algebra σ3 a = 1 , τ 3 a = 1 , σaτa = ωτaσa (2) and commute on diﬀerent sites, e.g., σaτb = τbσa for a ̸= b. The most general nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian for the three-state clock model on an open L-site chain is H = −J L−1∑ a=1 (eiφσ† a+1σa + h.c.) − f L∑ a=1 (eiθτ † a + h.c.) . (3) Throughout we assume purely real couplings J, f, φ and θ, with f and J non-negative. The Hamiltonian preserves several symmetries; see Ref. 24 for a detailed discussion. As a particularly important example, there is a global Z3 symmetry corresponding to a uniform shift of all spins generated by Q = ∏ a τ † a, which satisﬁes Q 3 = 1. The Hamiltonian also possesses duality symmetries when f = J and φ = θ that strongly constrain the phase diagram. The ferromagnetic case φ = 0 mod 2π/3—usually called the three-state Potts model—has been exception- ally well-studied from many viewpoints 25; some recent ef- forts motivated by the connection to topological physics include Refs. 22, 26, and 27. The model exhibits a self- dual critical phase transition at f = J separating ordered (f < J) and disordered (f > J) phases. In the ordered phase the system admits three degenerate ground states characterized by ⟨σa⟩ ̸= 0. Acting with the generator Q cycles through these ground states, indicating sponta- neous Z3 symmetry breaking. The disordered phase, by contrast, yields a unique, symmetric ground state with ⟨σa⟩ = 0. When φ ̸= 0 mod π/3, the clock model model is chi- ral, breaking spatial parity and time-reversal symme- tries. The chiral case exhibits a much more intricate phase structure than the ferromagnetic limit. Some in- formation can be obtained by exploiting integrability on the two-parameter manifold J cos(3φ) = f cos(3θ), where for example an incommensurate phase with ground-state level crossings appears21. A systematic numerical anal- ysis was (ﬁnally!) performed recently, ﬁnding accurate phase boundaries between ordered, trivially disordered, and incommensurate phases 28. Interestingly, there is evi- dence that incommensurability occurs along the self-dual f = J, φ = θ line all the way up to the ferromagnetic limit. Broken symmetry states of the clock model deeply re- late to exotic topologically nontrivial phases of matter—a remarkable correspondence that becomes manifest upon exploiting the Fradkin-Kadanoﬀ mapping17 that rewrites the Hamiltonian in terms of parafermions. As with Ma- jorana fermions in the Ising chain, parafermions are de- ﬁned via products of ‘order operators’ σa and ‘disorder operators’ built from τ -strings that create kinks by wind- ing a macroscopic set of spins. Precisely, one set of parafermion operators reads α2a−1 = (ωσ† aτ † a)τ † a+1τ † a+2 · · · , α2a = (σ† a)τ † a+1τ † a+2 · · · , (4) which obey α3 b = 1 , αb αc = ωsgn(c−b) αc αb . (5) Notice that the parafermions do not commute at diﬀerent sites; this important property reﬂects their non-locality in clock variables. Equally importantly, they do not an- ticommute either, unlike fermions. Instead exchanging parafermion operators yields a complex phase of ω—a situation reminiscent of anyons. In terms of parafermions, the Hamiltonian is H = −Jeiφ ∑ b evenω2α† b+1αb − f e iθ ∑ b odd ω2α† b+1αb + h.c. (6) Even though H is bilinear in parafermions, the factor of ω±1 in the algebra (5) means that the model cannot 3 be solved simply by Fourier transformation (contrary to the Ising case). It is worth noting however that the en- tire spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian found by omitting ‘+h.c.’ in Eq. (6) is in a precise sense that of “free” parafermions29,30. At this point an interesting question arises: exactly how is the physics of the ordered and disordered clock- model phases encoded in the parafermion representa- tion? The answer directly relates to the existence of parafermion zero modes, which play an essential role throughout this review. B. Edge zero modes One important signal of a topological phase in 1D is the existence of robust edge zero modes, the analogue of gapless modes in higher dimensions. To be precise, consider a system with a discrete symmetry generated by an operator Q. We will say that the system pos- sesses a ‘strong zero mode’ if there exists an operator that commutes with the microscopic Hamiltonian up to terms falling oﬀ exponentially with system size, but does not commute with Q. The energy levels for each eigenvalue of Q must then be identical (modulo exponentially small corrections), resulting in degeneracies across the entire spectrum. Strong edge zero modes have the same prop- erty but additionally localize with exponential fall-oﬀ to the boundaries of an open system. As a famous example, the topological phase in the Majorana-chain representa- tion of the Ising model supports strong edge Majorana zero modes, which one can readily construct explicitly and exactly. 5,6 We emphasize that strong edge zero modes impose an extraordinarily strong constraint on the spectrum that propagates to arbitrarily high energies. In glaring con- trast, a 1D topological phase in general requires only ground-state degeneracy—a much weaker condition. It is thus useful to introduce the notion of a ‘weak edge zero mode’ that only commutes with the Hamiltonian projected into a low-energy subspace, thus encoding the minimal degeneracy necessary for a topological phase. While harder to ﬁnd, strong zero modes do oﬀer poten- tial advantages, since one in principle could exploit the excited-state degeneracies to build a fault-tolerant qubit that works even at high temperatures. 31 With these preliminaries in place, let us return to the parafermion representation of the clock chain. To estab- lish a baseline we ﬁrst examine two limits, illustrated in Figs. 1(a) and (b), where the model is trivially solv- able. In the ﬁgure circles within each box represent the two parafermions α2a−1 and α2a associated with a single clock site a; recall Eqs. (4). In the maximally disordered limit J = 0, spins on dif- ferent sites simply decouple, and so parafermions interact only with their partner on the same clock site as indicated by the bonds in Fig. 1(a). The parafermion chain then generically realizes a gapped trivial phase with a unique (a) (trivial) (topological) (critical) (b) (c) J = f> 0, φ = θ =0 J > 0,f =0 J =0,f > 0 FIG. 1. Schematic representation of the parafermion chain [Eq. (6)] deep in the (a) trivial and (b) topological phases, and (c) at the intervening critical point. ground state, consistent with the physics in the spin rep- resentation. When f = 0 the model maximally orders in spin lan- guage; accordingly, parafermions on adjacent clock sites strongly couple as represented by the bonds from one box to the next in Fig. 1(b). Here too the bulk of the parafermion chain generically acquires a gap, though now the edges behave more interestingly. In particu- lar, a novel feature at f = 0 is that the parafermions α1 and α2L on the ends disappear from the Hamilto- nian and thus commute with it. They do not, however, commute with the Z3 symmetry generator Q. The sys- tem therefore exhibits a pair of strong edge parafermion zero modes α1, α2L that signify the onset of a topologi- cal phase. When acting on any mutual eigenstate of H and Q, the zero modes yield a distinct eigenstate with the same energy. (The states must diﬀer because if q denotes the initial eigenvalue of Q, acting with α1 or α2L cycles the eigenvalue to ωq.) Thus the ground states and all ex- cited states assume at least threefold degeneracy in the f = 0 limit. While the degeneracy has a topological ori- gin in the parafermion representation, in spin language it arises from the three sectors of symmetry-breaking states with ⟨σa⟩ ̸= 0 and their excitations. The fate of the strong parafermion zero modes away from this trivial limit raises an important question: are there modiﬁed operators α1 + · · · and α2L + · · · that commute with the Hamiltonian even when f ̸= 0? A natural guess is that strong zero modes persist pro- vided the bulk gap remains ﬁnite so that the topologi- cal phase is intact; this intuition indeed proves correct in the Ising/Majorana case. The interesting answer here, however, is that the strong zero modes require chirality (i.e., φ ̸= 0 mod π/3) to survive! 16 This result is particu- larly surprising given that the topological phase is most robust (i.e., has the largest gap) in the ferromagnetic limit and, more broadly, always remains for suﬃciently 4 small f as long as the system orders ferromagnetically in spin language. 22,27,32. (Any topological signiﬁcance of the incommensurate phase is a so-far unexplored issue.) Instead, the topological phase in the non-chiral ferromag- netic φ = 0 limit generically supports only weak edge parafermion zero modes of the form α1,2L+· · · that nicely shift between three degenerate ground states but are not especially meaningful when acting on excited states. 27 There are several ways of seeing why strong parafermion zero modes require chirality. One method utilizes an iterative procedure16. Namely, split the Hamiltonian in Eq. (6) into two pieces H = JV + f F in the obvious way, so that [α1, V ] = 0 (and similarly for α2L). Because [H, α1] = f [F, α1] is non-vanishing, the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd some X satisfying [F, α1] = [V, X]. If such an X exists, then [H, α1 − (f /J) X] is of order f 2. One can attempt to repeat this procedure to con- struct strong zero modes as a power series in f /J. This exercise is straightforward for the Ising/Majorana case5; however, one ﬁnds16 for the Z3 parafermion chain that X is proportional to 1/ sin(3φ). Thus the iteration im- mediately breaks down for the non-chiral ferromagnetic limit—despite the robust topological bulk gap—implying the demise of strong edge zero modes at arbitrarily small but ﬁnite f /J. Conversely, Ref. 16 proved that the it- erative procedure can be implemented at all orders for sin(3φ) ̸= 0. Strong edge zero modes therefore exist for suﬃciently small f /[J sin(3φ)], although an explicit all- orders expression is not known. As in the Ising/Majorana case, the uniform couplings considered here are not ac- tually necessary; the above arguments still work when f and J vary spatially. Perturbation theory in f provides a complementary and illuminating way of understanding this curious result.32 First, we verify that the ground states in the topological phase remain exponentially degenerate for suﬃciently small f /J, as required for weak parafermion zero modes and hence topological behavior to exist. For the following it proves convenient to revert back to the equivalent clock-model representation and label the three spin orientations at each site by A, B, and C. At f = 0 and |φ| < π/3 the system exhibits three ground states given simply by |AAA . . . ⟩, |BBB . . . ⟩, and |CCC . . . ⟩. Since the f perturbation winds single spins, its action on, say, the A ground state gives a sum over excited states of the form f e iθ(|BAA . . . ⟩ + |ABAA . . . ⟩ + . . . ) + f e −iθ(|CAA . . . ⟩ + |ACAA . . . ⟩ + . . . ), all having an ex- citation energy of order J. The ﬁrst perturbative cor- rection to the ground-state energies then arises at order f 2/J, but crucially, Z3 symmetry requires it be identical for all three ground states. The energy splitting between diﬀerent ground states occurs only at order L in per- turbation theory because mixing ground states requires shifting all L spins. This yields a splitting proportional to (f /J)L, indeed exponentially small in system size. Such degeneracy is all that is necessary for the persistence of a topological phase in the parafermion chain. Qualitatively diﬀerent behavior appears for the ex- citations. Consider the ferromagnetic φ = 0 limit. The lowest-lying excitations arise from six ﬂavors of ‘one-kink’ states of the form | . . . AAABBB . . . ⟩, | . . . BBBAAA . . . ⟩, etc., all exactly degenerate at f = 0. Winding of single spins induced by the f perturbation not only allows the kinks to hop, but in an open chain also enables eﬃcient conversion of one ﬂavor to another. More precisely, sequential actions of f terms can produce the following sequence: (i) An | . . . AAABBB . . . ⟩ kink moves to the right end of the system where it becomes | . . . AAAB⟩, (ii) winding the rightmost spin changes kink ﬂavor to | . . . AAAC⟩, and (iii) hopping the kink leftward similarly allows |ACCC . . . ⟩ → |BCCC . . . ⟩ → | . . . BBBCCC . . . ⟩. The key is that we connected states related by a global Z3 transformation—precisely those linked by strong parafermion zero modes at f = 0— without leaving the degenerate subspace. These exci- tations thus acquire power-law splitting at any ﬁnite f , implying the immediate demotion of strong to weak zero modes. 32 In the chiral case, broken spatial parity causes the en- ergy of the intermediate | . . . AAACCC . . . ⟩ kink states to diﬀer from that of the initial | . . . AAABBB . . . ⟩ state. An enormous energy barrier consequently develops that sharply suppresses the above process and drives expo- nential instead of power-law splitting for the low-lying excitations. Thus chirality naturally favors the revival of strong zero modes, consistent with the iterative con- struction above. Intriguingly, a sharp transition (tuned, e.g., by the chi- ral phase φ) appears to separate couplings that produce strong vs. weak edge zero modes. Detailed numerics, for instance, do indeed see abrupt changes between expo- nential and power-law splitting among excited states. 32 Even more interestingly, the numerics suggest a contin- uous transition, in the sense that the splittings conform well to a scaling ansatz with ‘critical’ exponents. A par- ticularly striking feature worth emphasizing is that this transition is purely a property of excited states; indeed the ground states in the topological phase always exhibit exponential splitting and show no signs of ‘criticality’. In this sense the physics is reminiscent of transitions dis- cussed in the context of many-body localization 31,33. C. Parafermions in conformal ﬁeld theory Conformal ﬁeld theory enters the physics of topolog- ical phases in multiple ways. It provides a way of clas- sifying all the operators and characterizing their opera- tor products—i.e., their “fusion”—in many 1D quantum critical points. Such theories, for instance, describe con- tinuous transitions out of topological phases, including in the parafermion chain. They also describe the gapless edges of many two-dimensional topological phases. Re- markably, the same underlying mathematical structure remains important even away from quantum criticality. In fact it also characterizes the fusion and braiding of 5 anyons in the gapped 2D topological phase that we will construct in Sec. IV by coupling critical chains together. Parafermionic conformal ﬁeld theory, introduced and described in depth by Zamolodchikov and Fateev34, gov- erns the scaling limit of the three-state Potts ferromag- netic critical point [f = J and θ = φ = 0 in Eqs. (3) and (6)] that separates the topological and trivial phases of the parafermion chain; see Fig. 1(c) for an illustra- tion. Not surprisingly, there are parafermionic ﬁelds— conventionally labeled ψL and ψR—related to the lattice parafermion operators. The former left-moving ﬁeld de- pends on the space-time coordinates x and t solely via the combination x + vt for some velocity v, while the latter right-mover depends solely on x − vt. Each exhibits scal- ing dimension 2/3. Like their lattice counterparts, they obey the operator products ψL × ψL ∼ ψ† L and ψ3 L ∼ 1, and likewise for ψR. More surprisingly, taking the continuum limit of the lattice operator αb does not give the parafermion ﬁelds ψL and/or ψR as the leading pieces; other more relevant operators mix in as well 24,35. It is both formally inter- esting, and essential for the construction of 2D topolog- ically ordered phases reviewed in Sec. IV, to ﬁnd lattice operators that admit exclusively ψL or ψR as their domi- nant contribution in the long-distance limit, i.e., to ﬁlter out unwanted terms. Fortunately this is indeed possi- ble. A detailed analysis utilizing the problem’s discrete symmetries24 shows that the continuum limit of αb yields the combination αb ∼ c1ψL + c2(−1)bΦ , (7) where c1 and c2 denote unimportant numerical constants and Φ is the unwanted ﬁeld (which carries dimension 1/15 + 2/5 = 7/15 < 2/3). Because of the alternat- ing sign in the last term, a simple linear combination successfully isolates the parafermion ﬁeld: α2a−1 + α2a ∼ ψL . (8) Finding a lattice analog of ψR requires introduc- ing another—though not independent—set of lattice parafermion operators, β2a−1 = · · · τ † a−2τ † a−1(σ† a), β2a = · · · τ † a−2τ † a−1(ω2τ † aσ† a) . (9) Compared to Eqs. (4) these operators simply have τ strings running in the opposite direction. The α’s and β’s are hence related by spatial parity, which immedi- ately implies that β2a−1 + β2a ∼ ψR (10) as desired. A short overview of the parafermion conformal ﬁeld theory’s fusion algebra, geared toward the present con- text, appears in Ref. 35. One feature worth noting is the Fibonacci structure inherent in the “energy” ﬁeld E of scaling dimension 4/5. This Z3-invariant ﬁeld describes the scaling limit of the perturbation that moves the criti- cal parafermion chain into either the topological or trivial phases. In notation introduced in Sec. II B, the pertur- bation corresponds to the lattice operator F − V with θ = φ = 0. Fusion of the energy ﬁeld takes the form E × E = 1 + E, which underlies the appearance of ‘Fi- bonacci anyons’ that we will encounter in Sec. IV. III. EXPERIMENTAL BLUEPRINTS FOR PARAFERMION ZERO MODES We turn now to the crucial question of how one can experimentally realize parafermion zero modes. In what follows we focus exclusively on weak zero modes, though for brevity we hereafter drop the ‘weak’ qualiﬁer. Even for this case the problem poses a signiﬁcant challenge— certainly more so compared to the pursuit of their Ma- jorana cousins. For one, the parafermion chain Hamilto- nian constructed in Sec. II A involves neither bosons nor fermions as elementary constituents; thus at a minimum parafermion zero modes require a strongly correlated host featuring nontrivial emergent degrees of freedom. The Majorana chain, by contrast, caricatures a p-wave super- conductor built from electrons and admits a simple free- particle description. Further subtlety awaits even after we abandon the comforts of free particles: rigorous classi- ﬁcations of 1D bosonic and fermionic systems36–39 (sub- ject to a restricted set of symmetries) capture phases sup- porting Majorana zero modes but nothing more exotic— even with strong interactions! Fortunately loopholes exist. A recurring theme of this section will be the use of ‘anomalous’ edge states in 2D systems as a cradle for 1D phases that host parafermion zero modes. By deﬁnition such edge states can not appear in strictly 1D media and hence fall outside of the aforementioned classiﬁcations. Below we survey sev- eral candidate platforms, focusing on those built upon presently available physical systems. We stress that other interesting, often very closely related proposals exist in- cluding an important early work that invokes lattice de- fects in fractional Chern insulators40; generalized rotor models 41; and fractionalized topological insulators and superconductors 42–44 (among others). A. Quantum Hall/superconductor hybrids 1. Setup and physical origin of zero modes The ‘anyonic’ commutation relation exhibited by the zero modes of interest [recall Eq. (5)] spotlights fraction- alized 2D systems with anyons as natural parafermion hosts. Fractional quantum Hall phases provide many ex- perimentally relevant examples, and luckily one can trap parafermions even in the simplest varieties. For peda- gogical purposes we will ﬁrst examine in some detail a 6 (b) (c) Direct tunneling Direct tunneling“Crossed” tunneling α2α1 ν = 1 3 + 1 3 (a) Tunneling Spin-unpolarized bilayer TunnelingCooper pairing Superconductor 2e α2 ν =2/3 Two-electron backscattering Two-electron backscattering 2D topological insulator Cooper pairing Superconductor 2e α2α1 2e/3 1 -2e/3 2 -2e/3 3 α1 Domain wall 4e/3 pair 2e/3 dipole FIG. 2.

Earlier discussions of other fractions—which closely inform our treatment below— appear in Refs. 48 and 49. Figure 2(a) sketches the setup. A trench carved into the ν = 2/3 ﬂuid creates a fractionalized ‘wire’ consisting of edge states that, importantly, support gapless avatars of the anyons living in the adjacent bulk. Since an identi- cal set of counterpropagating modes appear opposite the trench, physical perturbations can always gap them out. Electron tunneling across the divide provides one mecha- nism that simply fuses the two ﬂuids together. Filling the trench with an ordinary s-wave superconductor allows a second, intuitively quite diﬀerent possibility: generat- ing a gap through proximity-induced spin-singlet Cooper pairing of electrons from the two edges. These tunneling and pairing mechanisms gap the trench’s spin sector in the same way but yield topologically distinct 1D gapped phases for the charge sector. Domain walls separating the two phases as in Fig. 2(a) bind zero-energy modes that, owing to the system’s fractionalization, correspond to Z3 parafermions. (For a detailed analysis see Refs. 35 and 50.) This setup bears the remarkable feature that the spin- singlet Cooper pairs induced by the parent supercon- ductor arise more fundamentally from conglomerates of 2e/3 charges present in the quantum Hall edges. The proximity eﬀect therefore not only condenses charge-2e bosons at the trench, but crucially also catalyzes ‘anyon condensation’ 51. To make this precise, we deﬁne ψ2e/3 to be the spin-conserving quasiparticle operator that adds charge 2e/3 symmetrically to the trench, with e/3 on each end. Then in a pairing-gapped region ⟨ψ2e/3⟩ ∼ ei 2π 3 p2e/3, (11) where p2e/3 takes on integer values. Thus ⟨ψ3 2e/3⟩, which essentially yields the expectation value of an ordinary charge-2e Cooper pair, becomes ∼ 1. A further remark- able implication follows: although the parent supercon- ductor can only absorb paired electrons, the trench can subsume fractional 2e/3 charges without energy penalty! An analogous situation emerges in tunneling-gapped regions. Electron hopping—which also involves multiple fractional charges—catalyzes a diﬀerent ﬂavor of anyon condensation with ⟨ψdipole⟩ ∼ e i 2π 3 pdipole, (12) where ψdipole creates a charge diﬀerence of 2e/3 across the trench and pdipole ∈ Z. Tunneling-gapped regions ac- cordingly can absorb e/3 dipoles with energetic impunity. Incidentally, this is how tunneling fuses the quantum Hall ﬂuids together; bulk anyons can then move coherently across the trench (leaving behind ‘invisible’ dipoles) even though the intervening region supports only electrons. To correctly count the degeneracy encoded by the zero modes, it is essential to observe that the above quasipar- ticle operators do not commute, [ψ2e/3(x), ψdipole(x′)] ̸= 0, (13) reﬂecting the fractional statistics of the corresponding bulk anyons. One therefore can not simultaneously spec- ify a unique phase for both ⟨ψ2e/3⟩ and ⟨ψdipole⟩ even though the condensates appear in diﬀerent spatial re- gions. In a basis where the pdipole integers lock to speciﬁc values the p2e/3 integers ﬂuctuate wildly. The dipole charges on tunneling-gapped regions correspond- ingly ﬂuctuate through the allowed low-energy conﬁgura- tions while each paired region realizes degenerate states with well-deﬁned total charge of 0, 2e/3, or 4e/3 (mod 2e). Conversely, specifying p2e/3 requires pdipole to ﬂuc- tuate, and in this basis the charges on paired regions ﬂuc- tuate while each tunneling-gapped region takes on one 7 of three degenerate conﬁgurations characterized by well- deﬁned dipole charges. In short, we can label ground states by charge conﬁgurations of either the tunneling or pairing regions, but not both. Introducing 2N do- mains walls then yields a degeneracy of √3 2N (neglecting Hilbert-space constraints). It follows that the ground- state degeneracy per domain wall—also known as the quantum dimension—equals √3. The Z3 parafermion zero-mode operators [denoted α1,2 in Fig. 2(a)] simply cycle the system through the ground- state manifold. To gain further intuition for these modes, consider adding charge 2e/3 to one end of the trench. Doing so within a pairing-gapped region costs energy (because of the ensuing dipole moment) and similarly for the tunneling regions (due to the net excess charge created). Within a domain wall, however, the following nontrivial process can uniquely arise: (i) The added 2e/3 charge propagates chirally until it hits a superconduct- ing region and Andreev reﬂects into a −2e/3 hole on the opposite side of the trench. The paired condensate ab- sorbs the deﬁcit 4e/3 charge. (ii) The −2e/3 hole hops back across the trench upon impinging on a tunneling- gapped region, whose condensate absorbs the resulting change in dipole charge. Figure 2(a) sketches both pro- cesses. (iii) Repeating the preceding steps converts the hole back into a 2e/3 charge. Parafermion zero-mode operators essentially create a uniform superposition of these conﬁgurations, which costs no energy.52 This phys- ical picture shows that the zero modes indeed localize to domains walls, add fractional charge of 2e/3, and thus in- herit their nontrivial commutation relations directly from the anyons native to the setup—consistent with the in- tuition laid out at the beginning of this subsection. 2. Zero-mode detection Armed with these insights, one can anticipate several sharp experimental signatures of parafermions. Imag- ine bringing a domain wall to the outer boundary of the host ν = 2/3 quantum Hall ﬂuid as in Fig. 3(a), thus allowing gapless fractionalized edge states to hybridize with a parafermion zero mode. In the asymptotic low- energy limit, the zero mode mediates ‘perfect Andreev conversion’:50 Incident 2e/3 quasiparticles convert with unit probability into −2e/3 holes at the domain wall, with the adjacent superconducting region absorbing the deﬁcit 4e/3 charge. Two-terminal transport from the edge through the superconductor is thus characterized by a quantized zero-bias conductance G = 2νe 2/h—twice the value obtained when current passes between two nor- mal leads. Perfect Andreev conversion represents a chiral analogue of the well-studied Majorana-induced perfect Andreev reﬂection53–56 and provides a conceptually sim- ple ﬁngerprint of parafermion zero modes. This eﬀect also oﬀers practical utility, as one can exploit its chiral nature to build exotic circuit elements including transis- tors for fractional charge and ﬂux capacitors. 50 A variant of Fig. 3(a) further enables detection of the domain wall’s quantum dimension through tunneling spectroscopy. In particular, introducing a second domain wall near the outer edge couples a pair of zero modes, thereby reducing the degeneracy. The zero-bias conduc- tance peak noted above consequently splits into g ﬁnite- voltage resonances57 with g the square of the quantum dimension. Consider next Fig. 3(b) where parafermion modes α1,2 hybridize across a Josephson junction with phases φL/R on the left/right superconductors.42,48,49,58 Here the parafermions yield an anomalous Josephson current mediated not by tunneling of ordinary Cooper pairs, but rather fractional 2e/3 charges. This eﬀect is actually quite natural given the aforementioned anyon condensa- tion present in the paired regions. Viewing eiφL/R as a charge-2e Cooper-pair creation operator, we see that the anomalous current (in the weak hybridization limit) takes the form I ∝ sin ( φL − φR 3 + θ) , (14) where the oﬀset phase θ depends on the precise state of the barrier. The Josephson current, in stark contrast to ordinary junctions, thus exhibits 6π periodicity in the phase diﬀerence φL − φR! This phenomenon general- izes Kitaev’s 4π-periodic ‘fractional Josephson eﬀect’ for Majorana systems, where supercurrent can arise via sin- gle electron tunneling. 5 The present setup, however, of- fers a potential advantage. Namely, whereas stray un- paired electrons spoil the unconventional periodicity in the Majorana case, the parafermionic Josephson eﬀect is immune to environmental electronic noise since ﬁner fragments carry the anomalous supercurrent. 3. Non-Abelian statistics One can proﬁtably view the superconducting region of the trench in Fig. 2(a) as an extrinsic line defect em- bedded brute force into the quantum Hall ﬂuid. The endpoints—where parafermion zero modes localize— represent topological point defects with the key prop- erty that a bulk anyon encircling one of the ends swaps the sign of its charge. [The sign change occurs via an Andreev-like process similar to Fig. 3(a) when the anyon crosses the paired region.] Such topological defects are conﬁned since they clearly incur an energy cost that grows linearly with their separation. Nevertheless it is valuable to view them as ‘particles’, particularly since it is often possible to devise schemes for controllably nucleating and mobilizing parafermion zero modes; see, e.g., Refs. 48 and 49. The theory of extrinsic defects in fractionalized media (whose properties intimately relate to symmetries of the topological ﬁeld theory describing the host platform) has been developed in great detail, e.g., in Refs. 41, 42, 48, 49, 51, 59–70. Here we will simply address the following important question: What 8 Superconductor Superconductor (b)(a) α2α1 φRφL 2e/3 Super- conductor 2e/3 -2e/3 4e/3 pair 1 2 α FIG. 3. Detection schemes for parafermion zero modes, illustrated using the ν = 2/3 setup from Fig. 2(a). (a) Hybridizing a zero mode with the gapless edge states generates ‘perfect Andreev conversion’. (b) Coupling Z3 parafermions across a Josephson junction yields a current (mediated by 2e/3 tunneling) 6π-periodic in the phase diﬀerence φL − φR. kind of ‘particle’ is the topological defect that binds a Z3 parafermion zero mode in our ν = 2/3 setup? Suppose that we introduce a set of 2N well-separated topological defects into the quantum Hall ﬂuid, generat- ing √3 2N ground states (again neglecting Hilbert-space constraints). Importantly, this degeneracy does not arise from a local property of the defects, consistent with their non-integer quantum dimension, but instead reﬂects the degenerate global charge conﬁgurations on the supercon- ducting regions linking parafermion zero modes. Hence provided the zero modes maintain their distance no lo- cal perturbation can split the ground states; they enjoy topological protection. Even more interestingly, adiabat- ically exchanging pairs of defects noncommutatively ro- tates the system’s quantum state within the degenerate manifold. In other words, the defects binding parafermion zero modes eﬀectively realize non-Abelian anyons—a fas- cinating conclusion given that the host ν = 2/3 system comprises a prototypical Abelian quantum Hall state. To demystify this seemingly paradoxical statement it is use- ful to think of the ν = 2/3 state as descending from a parent non-Abelian quantum Hall phase [closely related to SU(2)4]35,71 upon a phase transition that conﬁnes the non-Abelian anyons. By introducing superconducting re- gions into the ﬂuid, we simply provide the energy nec- essary to pull apart these conﬁned non-Abelian excita- tions, whose exotic properties we can still, remarkably, harness.72 Widespread interest in non-Abelian anyons stems partly from their potential utility for inherently fault- tolerant topological quantum computing.1,2 The key idea is that the degenerate ground-state manifold non-locally encodes topological qubit states that can be controllably manipulated through defect braiding by virtue of their non-Abelian exchange statistics. Braiding Majorana zero modes imparts only 90◦ qubit rotations, thus en- abling somewhat restricted fault-tolerant quantum infor- mation processing.2 It is therefore natural to ask whether our more exotic parafermion zero modes oﬀer compara- tive advantages. While in the parafermion case braid- ing provides additional gates that become trivial with Majoranas,49 their exchange statistics remains insuﬃ- cient for fully universal topological quantum computa- tion. We note as a teaser that it is possible to leverage closely related setups to achieve bona ﬁde computational universality (see Sec. IV), but ﬁrst we explore promising alternative settings for realizing parafermion zero modes. B. Quantum Hall bilayers Zooming out slightly, we saw in Sec. III A 1 that parafermion zero modes arise at the interface between two ‘incompatibly’ gapped regions of a trench in a frac- tionalized medium. The Cooper pairing exploited above provides one gapping mechanism that diﬀers fundamen- tally from ordinary electron backscattering, but inter- estingly is not always necessary. Certain quantum Hall phases admit multiple charge-conserving gap-opening processes that allow parafermion zero modes to emerge even without superconductivity. Figure 2(b) depicts an important example consisting of a quantum Hall bilayer with ν = 1/3 ﬁlling per layer. 60,73 A trench through the system can acquire a gap via (i) ‘di- rect’ tunneling, with electrons backscattering top-to-top and bottom-to-bottom and (ii) ‘crossed’ tunneling where electrons backscatter by moving between layers. Viewing the layer index as a pseudospin, these mechanisms gap the charge sector in the same fashion (inevitably, because charge is conserved) but produce distinct gapped phases in the pseudospin channel. Domain walls separating these incompatibly gapped phases once again trap Z3 parafermion zero modes. The associated ground-state degeneracy arises because the hopping perturbations catalyze diﬀerent ﬂavors of anyon condensation that allow the trench to freely absorb ‘hori- zontal’ intra-layer and ‘diagonal’ inter-layer e/3 dipoles in direct- and crossed-tunneling regions, respectively. Since the operators creating these two dipole types do not commute—again a reﬂection of fractional statistics of the corresponding bulk anyons—one can label ground states by the charge diﬀerences (mod 2e) on either direct- or crossed-tunneling regions but not both. The zero-mode operators cycle the system through the degenerate mani- fold by adding ‘vertical’ e/3 dipoles to one side of the trench; such dipoles cost ﬁnite energy everywhere ex- 9 cept inside of the domain walls, which explains why the parafermions localize. As in the superconducting case discussed previously, one can view the endpoints of crossed-tunneling regions as conﬁned topological point defects that carry quan- tum dimension √3 and exhibit non-Abelian statistics. A bulk anyon winding around such a defect ends up in the opposite layer from which it began (rather than reversing its charge). Given the quantum dimension, each additional crossed-tunneling region inserted into the ν = 1/3 + 1/3 bilayer increases the ground-state degener- acy threefold. Curiously, the degeneracy of a single-layer ν = 1/3 ﬂuid increases by precisely the same factor when system’s genus rises. This is no coincidence—upon rotat- ing the top layer in Fig. 2(b) by 180◦ about the trench, the crossed-tunneling region locally resembles a puncture drilled into in a ν = 1/3 system on a sphere. Barkeshli et al. 60 thus christened the topological defects in this bilayer setup ‘genons’. Parafermion zero modes bound to ‘genons’ yield trans- port ﬁngerprints similar to those arising in quantum Hall/superconductor heterostructure.57,73 For instance, hybridizing a zero mode with gapless edge states na- tive to the bilayer [in a straightforward generalization of Fig. 3(a)] generates a perfect-Andreev-reﬂection ana- logue where incoming ‘vertical’ dipoles from the edge switch polarity with unit probability.73 (The adjacent crossed-tunneling condensate readily absorbs the change in dipole moment.) More broadly, the similarity between the two setups discussed so far is quite remarkable given the total absence superconductivity in the present case. While the bilayer architecture nevertheless raises nontriv- ial fabrication challenges given the somewhat unnatural crossed-tunneling terms that we invoked, Ref. 73 suggests several plausible experimental routes to realizing the cou- plings (interestingly, not all of which are essential for the topological degeneracy). C. 2D topological insulator edges While we have now seen that fractionalized 2D systems with anyons indeed comprise natural parafermion-zero- mode hosts, fractionalization turns out, quite remark- ably, to be inessential. Two important works74,75 re- cently showed that one can instead trap parafermions us- ing a much simpler medium: a 2D topological insulator. As background, a 2D topological insulator edge supports counterpropagating electron modes described by opera- tors fR/L that form Kramers partners. These modes nec- essarily remains gapless provided the system preserves both particle-conservation and time-reversal symmetries. Conversely, adding superconductivity induces a pairing gap while introducing magnetism can gap the edge via backscattering. As shown earlier by Fu and Kane45 domain walls separating these clearly distinct gapped phases bind Majorana zero modes. More interestingly, replacing the magnetic backscattering terms with strong interactions that spontaneously break time-reversal sym- metry promotes these Majorana modes to more exotic Z4 parafermions! We can capture this result using a bosonized frame- work where the electron operators and density respec- tively become fR/L ∼ ei(ϕ±θ) and ρ = ∂xθ/π. The bosonized ﬁelds obey [ϕ(x), θ(x′)] = iπΘ(x − x′) with Θ(x) the Heaviside function and x an edge coordinate. Let us examine in this language the gapping mechanisms available in the absence of explicit time-reversal break- ing: (i) Proximity-induced Cooper pairing with strength ∆ yields a perturbation Hpair = − ∫ x(∆fRfL + H.c.) ∼ − ∫ x ∆ cos(2ϕ) (15) that gaps the edge by locking ϕ = πppair with ppair ∈ Z to minimize the energy. (ii) Time reversal forbids elas- tic single-electron backscattering but allows two-particle backscattering described by a Hamiltonian Hbs = − ∫ x(Γf † Rf † RfLfL + H.c.) ∼ − ∫ x Γ cos(4θ). (16) With suﬃciently strong density-density repulsion the coupling Γ becomes relevant and gaps the edge by pin- ning θ = π 2 pbs where pbs ∈ Z. 74–76 The system then spon- taneously breaks time reversal symmetry, as indicated by the local magnetization order parameter ⟨f † RfL⟩ ∼ (−1)pbs . Contrary to the situation with explicit sym- metry breaking, however, conﬁgurations with opposite magnetization (i.e., even vs. odd pbs) remain degenerate. This feature proves essential in what follows. Consider the setup of Fig. 2(c) where regions gapped by two-electron backscattering straddle a Cooper-paired edge segment proximate to a superconductor. 77 The backscattering terms pin θ = π 2 p l/r bs on the left/right re- gions while ϕ = πppair on the superconducting section. Similar to the situation encountered in Sec. III A 1, we can not uniquely ﬁx all of these integers since θ and ϕ do not commute. The special physics of this setup becomes most apparent in a basis where we specify pl/r bs , leaving the ppair integers wildly ﬂuctuating. The total charge (mod 2e) on the central paired segment then reads Q = e ∫ xr xl dx ∂xθ π = e θ(xr) − θ(xl) π = e 2 (pr bs − p l bs), (17) with xl/r positions just to the left/right of the super- conductor. Hence the superconducting part of the edge admits four degenerate states labeled by total charges 0, e/2, e, and 3e/2 (mod 2e). Furthermore, we see that raising p r bs or pl bs by one unit—thereby reversing the mag- netization in an adjacent backscattering region—pumps charge ±e/2 into the superconductor. Accordingly, local- ized Z4 parafermion zero-mode operators cycle the sys- tem through the degenerate manifold by adding spin and charge e/2 to the domain walls. 78 10 Hybridizing a pair of Z4 parafermions across a Joseph- son junction [similar to Fig. 3(b)] yields an anomalous 8π- periodic Josephson current reﬂecting e/2 transport across the barrier. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of this setup is that while isolated parafermion zero modes re- quire strong electron-electron repulsion—a nontrivial sce- nario to obtain in practice—the 8π-periodic Josephson ef- fect can survive even with arbitrarily weak interactions. 74 This beautiful result may be understood by adiabatic continuity: Starting from the strongly coupled limit, di- aling down the barrier’s interaction strength yields only smooth crossover behavior due to ﬁnite-size eﬀects, hence the robustness of the 8π periodicity. Since trapping parafermion zero modes does not re- quire systems with anyons, one might hope that even simpler purely 1D wires suﬃce. Several works have ex- plored this intriguing issue79–82, providing possible routes that do, however, require some amount of ﬁne-tuning—in accord with the 1D classiﬁcations discussed at the start of Sec. III. If parafermion zero modes can stably appear in strictly 1D setups they will likely require symmetry protection; ﬁnding explicit examples (or proving other- wise) remains an important open question. IV. FIBONACCI ANYONS FROM COUPLED PARAFERMIONS Braiding topological defects binding parafermion zero modes yields denser qubit rotations compared to the Ma- jorana case, but not suﬃciently dense to enable compu- tational universality. In search of universal topological quantum computing hardware we must therefore look to still more exotic non-Abelian excitations. Following the spirit of the above analysis, here we discuss a way to “engineer” the requisite topological order. For inspiration, we recall that potential “intrinsic” sources may arise from highly exotic quantum Hall phases. The Z3 Read-Rezayi state84, a natural gener- alization of the famed Moore-Read state85, provides a notable example. This phase features a gapless edge structure consisting of a charge mode together with a neutral sector described by a chiral Z3 parafermion con- formal ﬁeld theory (which comprises half of the non-chiral theory discussed in Sec. II C). As an intimately related consequence the bulk supports non-Abelian ‘Fibonacci anyons’ with the following properties: their quantum dimension is the golden mean, ϕ = (1 + √5)/2; two Fibonacci anyons brought together either annihilate or beget another Fibonacci anyon; and, most interestingly, their braiding provides a universal gate set 86,87. Fi- bonacci anyons thus constitute a holy grail for topological quantum computation. Ultimately the special physics of the Read-Rezayi state derives from a peculiar prop- erty built into the ground state: clustering correlations amongst triplets of electrons (as opposed to pairs that occur in a superconductor). The comparatively simple Abelian quantum Hall sys- tems exploited to obtain Z3 parafermion zero modes in Sec. III can, remarkably, provide close cousins of the Read-Rezayi state. As a concrete example, imagine pat- terning a 2D array of superconducting islands into a ν = 2/3 state, thereby generating a network of Z3 zero modes that encode a massive ground-state degeneracy reminiscent of the situation in a partially ﬁlled Lan- dau level. Judiciously hybridizing adjacent parafermion zero modes can then lift the degeneracy in favor of a superconducting ‘Fibonacci phase’ hosting a gapless chiral Z3 parafermion mode at its boundary and Fi- bonacci anyons in the interior.35 This outcome is actu- ally quite intuitive. As emphasized previously, the su- perconducting islands impart condensation of charge-2e Cooper pairs that derive from conglomerates of three fractionalized 2e/3 quasiparticles in the quantum Hall ﬂuid. Thus the heterostructure eﬀectively leverages pair- ing to mimic multi-particle clustering—making Read- Rezayi-like physics rather natural. The resulting corre- spondence between the superconducting Fibonacci phase and the Read-Rezayi state [summarized in Fig. 4(a)] gen- eralizes Read and Green’s7 classic work demonstrating the common non-Abelian content of a p + ip supercon- ductor and the Moore-Read state. Analytical and numerical analyses substantiate the preceding physical argument. One powerful method as- sembles the 2D Fibonacci phase from coupled chains sim- ilar to Teo and Kane’s seminal work88 that obtained non- Abelian quantum Hall phases from Luttinger liquid ar- rays. Here, however, we utilize the parafermion chains described in Sec. II instead of Luttinger liquids. Namely, we consider Z3 parafermion operators arranged on a tri- angular lattice with nearest-neighbor couplings t1, t2, and t3 sketched in Fig. 4(b) 83. The setup could arise either in a ν = 2/3 state with superconductivity or a ν = 1/3+1/3 bilayer with crossed-tunneling defects, among others. In the extreme limit t1,2 = 0 the problem reduces to decoupled Potts chains of Sec. II A, with J = f = t3 and φ = θ = 0. As Fig. 1(c) illustrates each chain therefore realizes a non-chiral Z3 parafermion critical point. The system’s gaplessness here is a great virtue since even ex- ceedingly weak interchain couplings t1,2 can profoundly impact the physics. Crucially, the relation between lat- tice parafermion operators and ﬁelds in the correspond- ing conformal ﬁeld theory is known 24; recall Eqs. (8) and (10). This relation allows a systematic analysis of the weakly-coupled-chain limit that ‘ﬁlters out’ irrele- vant lattice-scale details by projecting onto low-energy ﬁelds describing long-wavelength physics. (Reference 89 pursues a similar strategy, though we caution that their construction utilizes unphysical interchain couplings; see Ref. 24 for further discussion.) An especially desirable limit arises when t1 = t2 ≡ t, where the most relevant interchain perturbation becomes simply35,83 δH ∼ −t ∑ y ∫ x(ψ† R,yψL,y+1 + h.c.), (18) 11 ~ Read-Rezayi Fibonacci anyon parafermion parafermion Fib. phase + charge mode Z3 Z3 parafermion “unpaired” Z3 Fibonacci anyon Superconducting islands Spin-unpolarized ν =2/3 2e = 3(2e/3)e e e Z3 (a) (b) (c) t1 = t2 ≪ t3 t3 t2t1 = (1, 0, 0) ⃗t = (0, 0, 1) ⃗t = (0, 1, 0) ⃗t =(t1,t2,t3) FIG. 4.

The wavy lines on the right side of Fig. 4(b) designate the pattern of couplings, which completely gap the interior but leave behind ‘unpaired’ chiral Z3 parafermion modes at the boundary. Such a perturbation of the parafermion criti- cal point in purely 1D ﬁeld theory (i.e., if we instead cou- pled ψR to ψL in the same chain), results in a Fibonacci- type spectrum, as known exactly from integrability 90. In our coupled-chain system, the perturbation correspondly triggers precisely the Fibonacci phase anticipated above. While this analytic approach breaks down at stronger in- terchain couplings, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations allow a controlled exploration of the broader parameter space.83 Figure 4(c) sketches the numerically determined phase diagram; fortunately the Fibonacci phase enjoys a wide stability window extend- ing from weakly coupled chains to the isotropic triangular lattice limit (t1 = t2 = t3) and beyond! It is quite encouraging that a non-Abelian state suit- able for universal topological quantum computation can in principle emerge upon combining well understood com- ponents such as a ν = 2/3 state and conventional su- perconductors. Similar phases have also been predicted in various related settings including uniform quantum Hall bilayers91, quantum wire92 and spin chain 93 ar- rays, and even local bosonic models94. We also note that an interesting earlier study, Ref. 95, explored other coupled 2D parafermion lattice models and captured an Abelian topologically ordered phase that generalizes the toric code. These developments raise a number of in- triguing questions: How can the architectures reviewed here be further distilled to ease practical implementa- tion? What probes enable unambiguous detection of Fi- bonacci anyons in such setups? How might they be ma- nipulated to reveal their coveted braiding statistics? And can one pursue similar philosophies to obtain perhaps even more exotic non-Abelian phases? V. OUTLOOK Parafermions boast a more than three-decade history in condensed matter, with numerous now-classic applica- tions ranging from criticality in Potts chains to the non- Abelian Read-Rezayi quantum Hall phases. Despite this lengthy history, understanding of parafermions—both on a formal and practical level—has advanced signiﬁcantly during the past few years. Much of this progress can be viewed as extending the wildly inﬂuential Ising-model physics (in its myriad of incarnations) into more exotic territory. On the formal end we saw in Sec. II that para- fermion chains exhibit a topological phase supporting parafermion zero modes that comprise natural Majorana generalizations. While appealing parallels with the sim- pler Ising/Majorana chain do exist, we encountered sub- tle surprises owing to the inherently strongly interacting nature of parafermions. As one intriguing example, even deep within the topological phase strong parafermion zero modes (which guarantee threefold degeneracy of all eigenstates) can abruptly transform into weak zero modes due to an unusual form of quantum criticality operating solely within the excited states. The eﬀect of disorder on this transition raises an interesting issue that warrants 12 further exploration; in particular, following Refs. 31 and 33 it is tempting to anticipate a many-body localized phase that resurrects strong zero modes even when they are absent in the clean system. Another recent formal advance established the pre- cise correspondence between lattice parafermion opera- tors and continuum parafermion ﬁelds emerging in the critical chain. These relations not only clarify certain aspects of the conformal ﬁelds theory, but also underlie controlled analytical techniques that attack 2D systems built from parafermion chains. Yet another example is the identiﬁcation of a ‘free-parafermion’ limit obtained in a deformed non-Hermitian parafermion chain model.30 Might it be possible to bootstrap oﬀ of this limit to controllably attack strongly interacting parafermion sys- tems? Or can one perhaps design implementations of the free-parafermion model itself? By now many proposed experimental realizations of parafermion zero modes exist. We focused in Sec. III on three classes of systems that appear especially promis- ing in that they rely entirely on well-understood phases of matter: Abelian quantum Hall/superconductor hy- brids, simple quantum Hall bilayers with ‘genon’ defects, and strongly interacting 2D topological insulator edges coupled to superconductivity. The ﬁrst class perhaps appears a somewhat awkward marriage given the high ﬁelds usually required to observe fractional quantum Hall physics. We stress, however, that very recent experi- ments successfully induced a proximity eﬀect in GaAs quantum wells using high-critical-ﬁeld (> 10T) NbN su- perconducting contacts.96 This development bodes well for the prospects of exploring the interplay between quan- tum Hall physics and superconductivity—a largely un- tapped experimental arena ripe for discovery. Bilayer ‘genon’ proposals require controlled manipulation of edge states to selectively hybridize diﬀerent pairs of coun- terpropagating modes, which although nontrivial seems achievable with presently available gating technology.73 Such systems carry the added bonus that detecting parafermion zero modes can also reveal (albeit indirectly) the topological ground state degeneracy of quantum Hall phases on nontrivial-genus manifolds.57 Interacting 2D topological insulator edges may oﬀer the most immedi- ate prospects of detecting signatures of parafermion zero modes. Two virtues are particularly noteworthy here: First, experiments have already achieved the required coupling to superconductors, 97,98 and second, the anoma- lous 8π-periodic Josephson eﬀect that parafermions me- diate survives even in the weakly interacting limit.74 One can view arrays of coupled parafermion zero modes in such setups as new low-energy degrees of free- dom from which even more exotic higher-dimensional topological phases can emerge. Our understanding of the possibilities is certainly far from complete, though initial studies have already revealed exceptionally rich physics. Notably, networks of parafermion modes arising in the above quantum-Hall-based platforms can yield a ‘Fibonacci phase’ that represents an analogue of the cov- eted Z3 Read-Rezayi state with all but the most inter- esting non-Abelian Fibonacci anyons—which carry uni- versal braid statistics—distilled away. This insight pro- vides proof of principle that well understood components can combine to yield universal topological quantum com- puting hardware. Simplifying the requisite architectures poses an important outstanding challenge. One promis- ing avenue is to wield numerics to examine the phase diagrams of uniform quantum Hall/superconductor hy- brids and quantum Hall bilayers in search of related non- Abelian phases; studies in the latter setting have in fact recently been carried out 99–101. While experimental prospects and tantalizing long- term technological applications are certainly exciting, in our view it is worth emphasizing the inherent theoretical beauty underlying the advances in parafermions surveyed here. The physics that has so far emerged intimately links seemingly disparate areas across condensed-matter physics to an extent that rivals the reach of the Ising model. As this story continues to evolve, undoubtedly many more fundamental insights will be gained in this fascinating ﬁeld. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are indebted to D. Aasen, E. Berg, D. Clarke, A. Essin, M. P.

(15) and (16). 79 Y. Oreg, E. Sela, and A. Stern, Phys. Rev. B, 89, 115402 (2014). 80 J. Klinovaja and D. Loss, Phys. Rev. Lett., 112, 246403 (2014). 81 J. Klinovaja and D. Loss, Phys. Rev.
