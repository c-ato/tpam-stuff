In particular, it is just as natural and useful to consider defects in topological quantum ﬁeld theories as it is to consider morphisms in categories. In physics, topological defects are lower-dimensional regions in spacetime where something special is going on. They are ‘defective’ in the sense that they are dif- ferent in nature and/or substance from their surroundings. They are ‘topological’ because geometric details like metrics are not necessary to characterise them; typ- ically this goes hand in hand with a high degree of stability. This loose description of topological defects captures the common denominator of various phenomena in cosmology (cosmic strings), ﬂuid dynamics (hydrodynamic solitons), condensed 2 matter (domain walls in ferromagnets), protein folding (topological frustration), and topological quantum computing. In mathematical physics and pure mathematics, topological defects take on a more conceptual role. They relate and compare diﬀerent quantum ﬁeld theories, and they provide a unifying perspective. In particular, symmetries of a given QFT and dualities between distinct theories (such as mirror symmetry) are special examples of topological defects. The purpose of these notes is to give an introduction to topological defects in 2-dimensional topological quantum ﬁeld theory. Such ‘defect TQFTs’ are deﬁned in the spirit of Atiyah and Segal, as functors on certain decorated bordism categories. Recall that a 2-dimensional closed TQFT is a symmetric monoidal functor Z c : Bord2 → Vectk, where Bord2 has oriented circles S1 as objects and oriented bordism classes as morphisms. 1 As we will discuss in detail in the next section, a defect TQFT is obtained by enlarging the bordism category: both objects and morphisms may have submanifolds of codimension 1, decorated by certain data. An example of such a ‘defect bordism’ is the decorated surface + − + + − − + + α1 α2 α3 α4 x1 x2x3 x4 x5 (1.1) Closed TQFTs are recovered as special cases of defect TQFTs by restricting to trivial decorations only. For instance, if we forget all decorations in (1.1) we obtain the familiar pair-of-pants = . More generally, open/closed TQFTs Z oc can also be subsumed under the um- brella of defect TQFTs. As we will review independently in Section 3.2, by deﬁnition Z oc does not only act on S1, but also on intervals Iab with endpoints labelled by elements a, b of some chosen set B of ‘boundary conditions’. We will 1Throughout these notes we assume that every manifold comes with an orientation. 3 also see in which precise way open/closed TQFTs are the special cases of defect TQFTs whose only defect lines are boundaries. Hence defect TQFTs reside on top of the sequence closed TQFTs & open/closed TQFTs & defect TQFTs. (1.2) It is well-known that 2-dimensional closed TQFTs Z c are equivalently de- scribed by commutative Frobenius algebras, namely the vector space Z c(S1) with (co)multiplication coming from the (co)pair-of-pants. Similarly, open/closed TQFTs Z oc naturally give rise to a category whose objects are the boundary conditions a, b, . . . ∈ B, and whose morphism spaces are what Z oc assigns to the decorated intervals Iab, cf. Section 3.2. As a generalisation of these facts we will explain how every 2-dimensional defect TQFT Z naturally gives rise to a certain 2-category BZ [DKR]. Its objects are to be thought of as closed TQFTs, its 1-morphisms correspond to line defects, and its 2-morphisms are operators associated to intersection points of defect lines. Thus in a nutshell: closed TQFT =⇒ algebra open/closed TQFT =⇒ category defect TQFT =⇒ 2-category One motivation to consider the 2-category BZ is the following simple motto: Correlators of the theory Z are string diagrams in the 2-category BZ. Indeed, we will explain how topological correlators rigorously translate into the algebraic setting of BZ, where they can be easily manipulated and computed. As speciﬁc examples we will discuss sphere and disc correlators in detail. Another reason to adopt a higher-categorical language to study defect TQFTs is that the conceptual clarity and bird’s eye view make known symmetries and dualities appear more natural. Even better, the algebraic framework of BZ paves the way to new dualities and new equivalences of categories [FFRS, CR, CRCR, CQV]. The remainder of these notes is organised as follows. In Section 2.1 we in- troduce the 2-dimensional defect bordism category Borddef 2 (D). Then we deﬁne TQFTs as symmetric monoidal functors Z : Borddef 2 (D) → Vectk and explain how closed and open/closed TQFTs are special cases. (An independent intro- duction to open/closed TQFT is given in Section 3.2.) In Section 2.2 we review the basic notions for 2-categories which are needed for the construction of a ‘piv- otal’ 2-category BZ for every defect TQFT Z in Section 2.3. Then in Section 2.4 we discuss various examples. Section 3 takes pivotal 2-categories as the starting point and shows how to construct open/closed TQFTs from them, under two natural assumptions. The 4 purely closed case is discussed in Section 3.1, where for every object in a 2- category satisfying Assumption 3.1 we construct a commutative Frobenius alge- bra. In the parenthetic Section 3.2 we review open/closed TQFTs and discuss how they are algebraically encoded in terms of Calabi-Yau categories and the Cardy condition. Finally in Section 3.3 we extract such algebraic data from ev- ery object in a 2-category satisfying Assumption 3.1 and 3.7. Thus we make sense of the purely algebraic version of (1.2): Frobenius algebras & Calabi-Yau categories & pivotal 2-categories. Acknowledgements I thank F. Montiel Montoya, D. Murfet, P. Pandit, A.

Similarly, to describe an n-dimensional defect TQFT we need sets Dj whose elements label the j-dimensional defects in bordisms for j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. Note that for topological theories we do not require a set D0 as input data to label points; we will see how the defect TQFT itself computes the set D0. In addition to the defect label sets Dj, we also need a set of maps D be- tween them to encode how defects of diﬀerent dimensions are allowed to meet – e. g. which labels in Dn−1 may occur on domain walls between two given n- dimensional regions, or what the neighbourhood around a D1-labelled defect line can look like. We collectively refer to the sets Dj and maps D as defect data D. We will momentarily describe D in detail for the case n = 2. An n-dimensional defect TQFT naturally gives rise to an (n + 1)-layered struc- ture: The basic layer (‘objects’) is formed by the set Dn. The next layer (‘1- morphisms’) mediates between elements of Dn (via the maps D), and is com- prised of lists of elements of Dn−1. Then there is a layer (‘2-morphisms’) made of elements in Dn−2, which is between 1-morphisms. This goes on until we have (n − 1)-morphisms built from D1, and ﬁnally there are n-morphisms which are computed from the TQFT itself. Unsurprisingly, this (n + 1)-layered structure turns out to be an ‘n-category’. The case n = 2 was ﬁrst worked out in [DKR], and we will now review it in detail. 2 2The case n = 3 was worked out in [BMS]. The details for n > 3 have not been worked out. 5 We assume the reader is familiar with Atiyah’s deﬁnition of 2-dimensional closed TQFTs as symmetric monoidal functors Bord2 → Vectk as reviewed in [Koc]. Furthermore, we will exclusively consider oriented TQFTs; hence all the circles and bordisms below implicitly come with an orientation. A 2-dimensional defect TQFT is a generalisation where the bordism category Bord2 is enlarged: by deﬁnition a defect TQFT is a symmetric monoidal functor Z : Bord def 2 (D1, D2, s, t) −→ Vectk . What is Bord def 2 (D1, D2, s, t)? First of all, D1 and D2 are any two chosen sets, which will label 1-dimensional lines and 2-dimensional regions on bordisms, respectively. The source and target maps s, t : D1 −→ D2 tell us how D2-labelled regions may meet at D1-labelled lines. To wit, in the defect bordisms introduced below, the region to the right of a line labelled by x ∈ D1 must be labelled by s(x) ∈ D2, and the label on the left is t(x) ∈ D2: t(x) s(x) x We now use the chosen defect data D := (D1, D2, s, t) to decorate the objects and morphisms in Bord def 2 (D). An object in Bord def 2 (D) is a disjoint union of circles S1 with ﬁnitely many points p ∈ S1 \\ {−1} labelled by pairs (x, ε) with x ∈ D1 and ε ∈ {±}, and line segments between such points p are labelled by elements in D2. Such decorated circles are called defect circles. An example of an object in Borddef 2 (D) is the disjoint union (x1, +) (x2, +) (x3, −) α1 α2 α3 β where the second defect circle has no marked point and is decorated with β ∈ D2. A morphism in Borddef 2 (D) is either a permutation of the labels on a given defect circle, or a defect bordism class. A defect bordism is an ordinary bordism Σ in Bord2 together with an oriented 1-dimensional submanifold Σ1. This submanifold may have nonempty boundary ∂Σ1, but we require ∂Σ1 to lie in the boundary 6 of the bordism: ∂Σ1 ⊂ ∂Σ. Each connected component (‘defect line’) of Σ1 is labelled by an element in D1, while the components (‘phases’) of Σ \\ Σ1 are labelled by elements in D2 such that the phase to the right (respectively left) of an x-labelled defect line is decorated by s(x) (respectively t(x)). Defect lines may meet the boundary of Σ only transversally, and only at marked points p of the associated defect circle. If p is decorated by (x, ε) and sits on the in-going boundary, then the defect line touching p must also be labelled by x, and it must be oriented away from (respectively towards) the boundary if ε = + (respectively ε = −). If p sits on the out-going boundary then the role of the sign ε is reversed. Finally, the D2-labels of line segments in objects in Bord def 2 (D) must coincide with those of their adjacent phases in Σ \\ Σ1. Two defect bordisms belong to the same class if there exists an isotopy between them whose restriction to defect lines is a bijection, and if the defect labels are the same. The condition that marked points on defect circles cannot sit at −1 ∈ S1 ensures that rotating all marked points by 2π is disallowed and hence cannot give rise to non-trivial endomorphisms. An example of a defect bordism is the decorated surface + − + + − − + + α1 α2 α3 α4 x1 x2x3 x4 x5 (2.1) where we choose to view the two inner circles as in-coming boundaries, and the outer circle as out-going. Hence this ‘pair-of-pants’ represents a morphism (x3, −) (x2, +) (x1, +) α2 α1 α1 ⊔ (x2, −) (x3, +) α1 α2 −→ (x1, +) (x4, −) (x4, +) α1 α1 α3 . As in (2.1), we sometimes do not decorate boundaries with D1, D2 when drawing bordisms, as these decorations can be inferred from those of the interior. 7 2.1.1 Open/closed TQFTs as defect TQFTs A closed TQFT is the special case of a ‘defect TQFT without defects’. More precisely, if we choose D1 = ∅ (‘no defect lines’) and D2 = {•} (‘only a single phase’) then s, t are trivial, and forgetting the label • attached to every bordism is an equivalence Borddef 2 (∅, {•}) → Bord2. Another special case are open/closed TQFTs Bord oc 2 (B) → Vectk, where ob- jects in the bordism category may also involve intervals with endpoints labelled by elements of a set (of ‘boundary conditions’) B, cf. Section 3.2. Indeed, let us choose D1 = B , D2 = {•, ◦} with s(D1) = {◦} , t(D1) = {•} , where we interpret ◦ as the label for the ‘trivial theory’ (whose associated Frobe- nius algebra is k). Then there is a forgetful functor U : Bord def 2 (B, {•, ◦}, s, t) → Bord oc 2 (B) which erases all line segments and phases labelled by ◦, and which forgets the label • for the remaining line segments and phases. For example, a ﬂat pair-of-pants in Bord oc 2 (B) is obtained as x y y z x z x z y = U           x z y •◦           where the ◦-labelled phase may close to any bordism, e. g. the sphere. A 2-dimensional closed TQFT Z c is equivalently described by a commutative Frobenius algebra [Koc]. Similarly, an open/closed TQFT Z oc is equivalent to a commutative Frobenius algebra (what Z oc assigns to a circle) and a Calabi-Yau category (whose set of objects is B, and whose Hom spaces are what Z oc assigns to intervals), together with certain maps [Laz, AN, MS, LP1]. Below in Section 3.2 we will review this in more detail, and in Section 3.3 we will explain how all these algebraic structures are naturally obtained from the general perspective of defect TQFT. However, we ﬁrst need to bring the process closed TQFT ≈ Frobenius algebra open/closed TQFT ≈ Calabi-Yau category add boundary structure to its logical conclusion and show how the expectation defect TQFT ≈ pivotal 2-category can be made rigorous. 8 2.2 Pivotal 2-categories We start with a brief review of 2-categories and their graphical calculus; for a more detailed account we refer to [Ben, KS, Lau2]. Let us ﬁrst recall that every k-algebra A can be viewed as the endomorphism space End(∗) of a k-linear category with a single object ∗. In this sense a category generalises the idea of ‘many algebras together’. A 2-category is ‘many monoidal categories together’. The precise deﬁnition is that a 2-category is a category enriched over the category of small categories. This means that for any two objects α, β of a 2-category B, there is a category B(α, β) whose objects are called 1-morphisms from α to β, and whose morphisms are called 2-morphisms. The composition of two 2-morphisms in B(α, β) is called vertical composition. Since 1-morphisms can also be composed (being morphisms in B) there are functors ⊗ : B(β, γ) × B(α, β) −→ B(α, γ) which we refer to as horizontal composition. A good example of a 2-category is that whose objects, 1- and 2-morphisms are small categories, functors and natural transformations, respectively. The attributes ‘vertical’ and ‘horizontal’ for the two types of composition in a 2-category B derive from the graphical calculus, which allows to perform com- putations in B in terms of so-called string diagrams, according to the following rules: • Objects in B label 2-dimensional regions in the plane. • 1-morphisms X : α → β label smooth lines with α to the right and β to the left. The lines must be progressive, i. e. at no point on the line may the tangent vector have zero component in upward direction, cf. [BMS, Def. 2.8]. For example: β α X Such an X-line is also identiﬁed with the unit 2-morphism 1X ∈ End(X). • 2-morphisms Φ : X → Y label vertices on a line with label X below and label Y above the vertex, respectively: β α X Y Φ . This diagram is identiﬁed with Φ. 9 • Vertical composition of Φ : X → Y and Ψ : Y → Z really is vertical, read from bottom to top: X Y Z Φ Ψ = X Z ΨΦ . Note that as above we sometimes suppress labels for 2-dimensional regions. • Horizontal composition really is horizontal, read from right to left: γ β α X Y X ′ Y ′ ΦΨ = γ α X ′ ⊗ X Y ′ ⊗ Y Ψ ⊗ Φ ≡ γ β β α X Y X ′ Y ′ Ψ ⊗ Φ Here we used the additional rule that elements in the set of 2-morphisms Hom(X1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Xm, Y1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Yn) may be depicted as vertices with m in-coming Xi-lines and n out-going Yj-lines. Consistency with X = X ⊗ 1α then demands that the unit 1-morphisms 1α can be represented by invisible lines. Hence every progressive string diagram represents a 2-morphism by reading it from bottom to top and from right to left. For example X1 X2 X3 X4 Y1 Y2 Φ1 Φ2 Ψ = Ψ◦(Φ1⊗Φ2) : X1⊗X2⊗X3⊗X4 −→ Y1⊗Y2 . (2.2) But what if the loci of the lines or vertices vary a little? Does X1 X2 X3 X4 Y1 Y2 Φ1 Φ2 Ψ represent the same 2-morphism as (2.2)? It better should, and this is guaranteed by the following rule: 10 • String diagrams which are related by progressive isotopies represent the same 2-morphism [BMS, Sect. 2.2]. This in particular implies the interchange law (1 ⊗ Φ) ◦ (Ψ ⊗ 1) = Ψ Φ = Ψ Φ = (Ψ ⊗ 1) ◦ (1 ⊗ Φ) (2.3) which is a consequence of the functoriality of ⊗. String diagrams for 2-categories are already reminiscent of local patches on de- fect bordisms. To make this relation precise we need to enlarge the type of string diagrams we consider, by giving an orientation to every line, and by allowing them to make ‘U-turns’. In order to continue to have a 1-to-1 relation between isotopy classes of string diagrams and 2-morphisms, we need however to consider 2-categories with additional structure: 2-categories ‘with adjoints’. Given a 1-morphism X : α → β in a 2-category B, we say that X has a left adjoint if there is †X ∈ B(β, α) together with 2-morphisms evX : †X ⊗ X −→ 1α , coevX : 1β :−→ X ⊗ †X subject to the conditions ( 1X ⊗ evX ) ◦ ( coevX ⊗1X) = 1X , ( evX ⊗1†X) ◦ ( 1†X ⊗ coevX ) = 1†X . (2.4) Since the adjunction maps evX, coevX are something special, they deserve spe- cial diagrammatic notation: evX = X†X , coevX = X †X . (2.5) Here we are using our ﬁnal rule for string diagrams: • Lines for objects X with an adjoint come with an orientation. Such lines need not be progressive, but the only non-progressive parts must be dia- grams for adjunction maps as in (2.5) or (2.6). Upward-oriented line seg- ments are labelled X, downward-oriented segments are labelled †X or X †. In diagrammatic language the conditions (2.4) are easy to remember: they are called Zorro moves and state that ‘lines may be straightened out’: X X = X X , †X †X = †X †X . 11 Similarly, the right adjoint of X ∈ B(α, β) is X † ∈ B(β, α) together with adjunction maps ̃evX = X †X : X ⊗ X † −→ 1β , ˜coevX = X † X : 1α −→ X † ⊗ X (2.6) that satisfy the Zorro moves X X = X X , X † X † = X † X † . If every 1-morphism in B has a left and a right adjoint, we say that B has adjoints. While it is not diﬃcult to prove that left and right adjoints are unique up to isomorphism, †X need not be isomorphic to X † in general. However, since from the perspective of TQFT taking the adjoint corresponds to orientation reversal on defect lines, we expect †X = X † in the 2-categories we will construct from defect TQFTs. More precisely, we will encounter pivotal 2-categories, which by deﬁnition have adjoints with †X = X † for all 1-morphisms X, and where both adjoints for 2-morphisms are identiﬁed as well. This means we require the identities Z† X † Φ = †Z †X Φ , Y †X † (Y ⊗ X)† = †Y†X †(Y ⊗ X) (2.7) whenever these diagrams make sense. If the left and right adjoints of a 1-morphism X ∈ B(α, β) coincide, we can compose ˜coevX with evX, and coevX with ̃evX. These composites are called the left and right quantum dimensions: diml(X) = α β X ∈ End(1α) , dimr(X) = β α X ∈ End(1β) . (2.8) 12 More generally, in a pivotal 2-category the left and right traces of an endomor- phism Ψ ∈ End(X) are deﬁned to be trl(Ψ) = α β X Ψ ∈ End(1α) , trr(Ψ) = β α X Ψ ∈ End(1β) . (2.9) It follows from the ﬁrst identity in (2.7) that traces have the expected cyclic property, i. e. trl(ΦΨ) = trl(ΨΦ) and trr(ΦΨ) = trr(ΨΦ) for any anti-parallel pair of 2-morphisms Φ, Ψ. The above notions of adjoints, quantum dimensions and traces generalise the case of ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces V ∈ Vectk. Indeed, †V and V † are given by the dual vector space V ∗, and evV really is the evaluation V ∗ ⊗k V → k, ϕ ⊗ v ↦→ ϕ(v). Choosing a basis {ei} of V , we set coevV (λ) = λ ∑ i ei ⊗ e∗ i for all λ ∈ k, and analogously for ̃evV and ˜coevV . Then one easily veriﬁes the Zorro moves, and (2.9) reduces to the ordinary traces of linear operators (under the canonical identiﬁcation V ∗∗ ∼= V ). In particular we have diml(V ) = dimr(V ) = dimk(V ). 2.3 Pivotal 2-categories from defect TQFTs With the above preparations we can now construct, following [DKR], the pivotal 2-category BZ associated to a defect TQFT Z : Bord def 2 (D) −→ Vectk for any set of defect data D = (D1, D2, s, t). It will be convenient to switch between source and target maps depending on orientations, for which we deﬁne s(x, +) = s(x) , t(x, +) = t(x) and s(x, −) = t(x) , t(x, −) = s(x) for all x ∈ D1. Before we start with the construction of BZ, let us lead with its interpretation: objects ̂= closed TQFTs 1-morphisms ̂= line defects 2-morphisms ̂= ‘local’ operators inserted at defect junctions vertical composition ̂= operator product (2.10) horizontal composition ̂= fusion product unit 1-morphisms ̂= invisible defects adjunction ̂= orientation reversal 13 With this in mind it is no surprise that we deﬁne the objects of BZ to be the label set for 2-dimensional phases on defect bordisms: Obj(BZ) = D2 . Later in Section 3.1 we will extract a commutative Frobenius algebra from BZ for every α ∈ D2, so objects really are closed TQFTs. The set of 1-morphisms α → β is deﬁned to be {((x1, ε1), . . . , (xn, εn)) ∈ (D1 × {±})n ∣ ∣ ∣ n ⩾ 0 , s(xn, εn) = α , t(x1, ε1) = β , s(xi, εi) = t(xi+1, εi+1) for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n − 1} } . (2.11) Why? Clearly we want a defect line labelled by x ∈ D1 to be a 1-morphism between the objects s(x) and t(x): x s(x)t(x) . (2.12) But if this defect line is ‘fused’ with another one labelled y ∈ D1 whose source coincides with the target of x, y s(y) = t(x)t(y) , (2.13) there is a priori no element ‘y ⊗ x’ in D1 to label the fusion product of y and x. However, we can compose (2.12) and (2.13) to obtain xy s(x)s(y) = t(x)t(y) . (2.14) This picture should be thought of as the composite 1-morphism of y and x. And in general, any list of composable defect line labels with orientations X = ((x1, ε1), . . . , (xn, εn)) as in (2.11) is a 1-morphism from α to β: xnxn−1xn−2x1 s(xn) = αt(xn) = t(xn−1)s(xn−1) = t(xn−2). . .β = t(x1) (2.15) 14 For X = ((x1, ε1), . . . , (xn, εn)) : α → β and ̃X = ((̃x1, ̃ε1), . . . , (̃xm, ̃εm)) : β → γ we deﬁne horizontal composition to be concatenation of lists, ̃X ⊗ X = ( (̃x1, ̃ε1), . . . , (̃xm, ̃εm), (x1, ε1), . . . , (xn, εn) ) : α −→ γ . In particular, (2.14) really is the tensor product of (2.12) and (2.13). It is clear that horizontal composition in BZ is associative, and the unit 1-morphism 1α is simply the empty sequence (n = 0). The vector space(!) of 2-morphisms Hom(X, Y ) for X = ((x1, ε1), . . . , (xn, εn)) : α → β and Y = ((y1, ν1), . . . , (ym, νm)) : α → β is deﬁned to be Hom(X, Y ) = Z          (y1, ν1) (y2, ν2) . . . (ym−1, νm−1) (ym, νm) (x1, −ε1) (x2, −ε2) . . . (xn−1, −εn−1) (xn, −εn)          . (2.16) Why? First we note that it is only at this point that we make use of the functor Z. (Objects and 1-morphisms in BZ are built only from the defect data D1, D2, s, t.) Secondly, according to our interpretation (2.10), 2-morphisms should correspond to junction points such as αβ x1 x2 xn y1 y2 ym . . . . . . , (2.17) but we were not provided with a set D0 to label such points. However, we can use Z to build such a set; in fact it is precisely given by (2.16)! To see this, we cut a little hole around the vertex in (2.17) and keep track of orientations by assigning + to intersection points of lines pointing away from the hole, and − to 15 those pointing in the opposite direction: x1 x2 xn y1 y2 ym . . . . . . − − + − + − αβ Note that we have not lost any information. But now the boundary of the hole is an object in Bord def 2 (D). Applying Z as in (2.16) to it produces the label set for vertices allowed by the TQFT. Next we deﬁne vertical composition in BZ. As in the familiar case of closed TQFT, this product is obtained by applying Z to a pair-of-pants. In detail, let us consider a 2-morphism Φ ∈ Hom(X, Y ) as above, and another 2-morphism Ψ ∈ Hom(Y, Z) where Z = ((z1, µ1), . . . , (zk, µk)) : α → β. Then we deﬁne Ψ ◦ Φ = Z                             (z1, µ1) (z2, µ2) (zk, µk) (x1, −ε1) (x2, −ε2) (xn, −εn) (z1, µ1) (zk, µk) (y1, −ν1) (ym, −νm) (y1, ν1) (ym, νm) (x1, −ε1) (xn, −εn) αβ . . . . . . . . .                             ( Ψ ⊗k Φ ) ∈ Hom(X, Z) where the two inner boundary circles are in-coming, and the outer circle is out- going, and the orientations of defect lines can be inferred from those of their endpoints. Functoriality of Z implies that this composition is associative, and it 16 is unital with respect to the identity 1X = Z           (x1, ε1) (x2, ε2) (xn, εn) (x1, −ε1) (x2, −ε2) (xn, −εn) αβ . . .           (1) . Here the disc is viewed as a bordism from the empty set to the boundary circle, so applying Z gives a linear map k → End(X). To complete the construction of BZ as a 2-category, we need to deﬁne horizontal composition of 2-morphisms. Again this involves a pair-of-pants, but this time the defect decoration is diﬀerent: for Φ ∈ Hom(X, Y ) and ̃Φ ∈ Hom( ̃X, ̃Y ) where X, Y : α → β and ̃X, ̃Y : β → γ, we set ̃Φ ⊗ Φ = Z                            (̃y1, ̃ν1) (̃y2, ̃ν2) (̃ym, ̃ν ˜m) (y1, ν1) (y2, ν2) (ym, νm) (̃x1, ̃ε1) (̃x2, ̃ε2) (̃x˜n, ̃ε˜n) (x1, ε1) (x2, ε2) (xn, εn) αβγ . . . . . . . . . . . .                            (̃Φ ⊗k Φ ) . It remains to give BZ adjoints and show that it is pivotal. Since adjoints correspond to orientation reversal, adjoints are deﬁned to have opposite signs ε and reversed order: BZ(α, β) ∋ X = ((x1, ε1), . . . , (xn, εn)) =⇒ †X ≡ X † = ((xn, −εn), . . . , (x1, −ε1)) ∈ BZ(β, α) . Note that this was already implicitly used in the deﬁnition (2.16), so we have Hom(X, Y ) = Hom(1β, Y ⊗ X †). 17 To exhibit †X as the left adjoint to X we deﬁne the adjunction maps evX = X†X = Z           (x1, ε1) (x1, −ε1) (x2, ε2) (x2, −ε2) (xn, εn) (xn, −εn) α β ...           (1) : †X ⊗ X −→ 1α (2.18) and coevX = X †X = Z         (xn, −εn)(xn, εn) (x2, −ε2)(x2, ε2) (x1, −ε1)(x1, ε1) β α ...         (1) : 1β −→ X ⊗ †X . (2.19) The maps ̃evX, ˜coevX exhibiting X † as a right adjoint are deﬁned analogously, by reversing all orientations and orders in (2.18) and (2.19). Proving that the Zorro moves hold is straighforward, for example X X = Z                        β α X X †X                        (coevX ⊗k evX) 18 = Z                        β α X X †X                        (1) = Z           αβ X           (1) = X X , where in the second step we used functoriality of Z, and in the third step we used isotopy invariance in Bord def 2 (D). The pivotality conditions (2.7) are proved similarly, and we have arrived at the following result: Theorem 2.1. Every 2-dimensional defect TQFT Z gives rise to a k-linear piv- otal 2-category BZ as constructed above. By construction, string diagrams in BZ are correlators of Z. More precisely, a priori the 2-morphisms in BZ only capture the action of Z on defect bordisms that can be embedded into the plane. But what about the other bordisms for which this in not possible, such as the sphere S2? Below in Section 3.1 we will see how sphere correlators can be evaluated in BZ – under one additional assumption. Namely, in order to get from arbitrary defect bordisms Σ to string diagrams, one can project Σ onto a ﬁxed plane, and generically this leads to a string diagram.3 If this projection is not injective, then patches of diﬀerent phases of Σ will overlap on the plane. Hence one is led to a multiplicative structure on the set D2 labelling phases, i. e. the objects of BZ. More precisely, for the general procedure to consistently express defect correlators as string diagrams in BZ, i. e. to produce the same result for every generic projection, BZ should be monoidal. This is in fact true of all the examples associated to defect TQFTs 3The situation here is similar to that of knots in R3 and their knot diagrams. 19 I know of, and it is natural to conjecture that 2-dimensional defect TQFTs are equivalent to k-linear monoidal pivotal 2-categories. It is still an open problem to classify defect TQFTs, by proving a theorem along the lines of the above conjecture. Thus the situation is diﬀerent from that of closed TQFTs (which are equivalent to commutative Frobenius algebras), and that of open/closed TQFTs. The latter are basically equivalent to Calabi-Yau categories and the ‘Cardy condition’, the details of which we review in Section 3.2. Before moving on to examples, we mention that the classiﬁcation question is already settled for another, related type of ‘enhanced’ TQFTs. This however comes at the price of deﬁning such TQFTs as higher functors between higher categories, contrary to the approach discussed above where a higher category is constructed from an ordinary functor. Indeed, a 2-1-0-extended TQFT is a sym- metric monoidal 2-functor Bord2,1,0 → Algk, where roughly Bord2,1,0 has points, lines, and 2-manifolds with corners (all oriented) as objects, 1-, and 2-morphisms, respectively, while Algk consists of ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebras, bimodules, and bimodule maps. It was shown in [SP] that such extended oriented TQFTs are equivalent to separable symmetric Frobenius algebras in Algk. This is precisely as predicted by the cobordism hypothesis, as homotopy ﬁxed points of the trivial SO(2)-action on fully dualisable objects in Algk are separable symmetric Frobe- nius algebras [HSV]. 2.4 Examples In this section we sketch a number of pivotal 2-categories which are known (those in Sections 2.4.1, 2.4.7, and 2.4.8) or believed (those in Sections 2.4.2–2.4.6) to arise from defect TQFTs as described above. Presenting all details and the necessary background would inﬂate the length of the exposition exponentially. Hence we content ourselves with a rough account which mainly aims to subsume all examples under the common heading of defect TQFT, and to showcase the broad spectrum of interesting pivotal 2-categories. In fact most of the examples are not strict 2-categories, but their weak cousins called bicategories for which horizontal composition is associative and unital only up to coherent isomorphisms [Ben]. Luckily, every (pivotal) bicategory is equiva- lent to a (pivotal) 2-category, 4 so we just as well may work with the bicategories that ‘occur in nature’. 2.4.1 State sum models Separable symmetric Frobenius k-algebras also appear as special cases in defect TQFT. Indeed, they are the objects of a bicategory ssFrobk, whose 1-morphisms 4An analogous maximal ‘strictiﬁcation’ result does not hold for tricategories, which explains part of the richness of 3-dimensional TQFT. 20 from A to B are ﬁnite-dimensional B-A-bimodules, and 2-morphisms are bimod- ule maps. Horizontal composition of M : A → B and N : B → C is the tensor product N ⊗B M over the intermediate algebra, and the unit 1-morphism 1A is A viewed as a bimodule over itself.5 The left and right adjoints of a 1- morphism M are given by the dual bimodule M ∗. Thanks to the natural isomor- phism M ∗∗ ∼= M , the k-linear bicategory ssFrobk is also pivotal. It was shown in [DKR, Sect. 3] that ssFrobk is equivalent to the 2-category BZ ss associated to a special defect TQFT Z ss. To wit, Z ss : Bord def 2 ( Dss 1 , Dss 2 , s, t) −→ Vectk is a state sum model, generalising the state sum constructions of closed [FHK] and open/closed [LP2] 2-dimensional TQFTs. Here the defect data consist of the set Dss 2 of separable symmetric Frobenius algebras, the set Dss 1 of B-A-bimodules M for all A, B ∈ Dss 2 , and we have s(M ) = A and t(M ) = B. As in the closed and open/closed case, the construction of Z ss involves a choice of triangulation for objects and bordisms in Borddef 2 (D ss), a decoration of every triangulation with algebraic data, and a projection procedure that ensures that the construction is independent of the choice of triangulation. In the case of Z ss, additional technicalities arise from the compatibility of triangulation and defect lines. We refer to [DKR] for all details and only note that on objects, Z ss is deﬁned by Z ss          (Mn, εn) (Mn−1, εn−1) (M1, ε1) ... (M2, ε2)A1 An−1 An          = ⟲An(M εn n ⊗An−1 M εn−1 n−1 ⊗An−2 · · · ⊗A1 M ε1 1 ) where M + = M and M − = M ∗, and for an A-A-bimodule M , the vector space ⟲A M is deﬁned to be the cokernel of the map A ⊗ M → M , a ⊗ m ↦→ am − ma. It follows that Z ss( A ) = A/[A, A] is the 0-th Hochschild homology. Finally we note that ssFrobk naturally has a monoidal structure, given by tensoring over the ﬁeld k. The trivial Frobenius algebra k is the unit object. Invertible objects are those algebras A ∈ ssFrobk for which there exist algebras B, B′ ∈ ssFrobk such that A ⊗k B and B′ ⊗k A are Morita equivalent to k. It follows that isomorphism classes of invertible objects in ssFrobk precisely form the Brauer group of k. 2.4.2 Algebraic geometry Next we consider a more geometric example, the bicategory Var. It has smooth and proper varieties as objects, 1-morphisms are Fourier-Mukai kernels, and 2- 5It follows that invertible 1-morphisms in ssFrobk are precisely Morita equivalences. 21 morphisms are their maps up to quasi-isomorphism. Hence for U, V ∈ Var, we have that Var(U, V ) = D b(coh(U × V )) =: D(U × V ) is the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on the product space. Hor- izontal composition of kernels E, F is the convolution E ◦ F, and the unit 1U is the structure sheaf O∆U of the diagonal ∆U ⊂ U × U . Adjunctions in Var were studied in detail in [CW]. The ‘naive’ adjoint of E ∈ Var(U, V ) is E ∨ := HomD(U ×V )(E, U × V ), but by Grothendieck duality the true adjoints are obtained by ‘twisting with the Serre kernel’: we have †E = E ∨ ◦ ΣV , E † = ΣU ◦ E ∨ , where ΣU is obtained from the canonical line bundle ωU as ΣU = (∆U )∗ωU [dim U ]. It follows that Var is not pivotal ‘on the nose’, but only has polite dualities as explained in [CW]. One way to look at the failure of Var being strictly pivotal is via its interpre- tation in terms of B-twisted sigma models, whose defects were also studied in [Sar, AS]. Indeed, in theoretical physics to every object U in Var one associates a ﬁeld theory called an ‘N = (2, 2) supersymmetric sigma model’. There is a procedure called ‘topological B-twist’ [HKK+, Ch. 16] that produces a closed 2- dimensional TQFT from U if it is a Calabi-Yau variety, i. e. ωU is trivial. Indeed, in this case Hochschild homology and cohomology coincide up to shift and are isomorphic to Dolbeault cohomology H ¯∂(U ). Then together with the Mukai pair- ing H ¯∂(U ) is a commutative Frobenius algebra in the category of graded vector spaces Vect gr C . Hence H ¯∂(U ) describes a closed TQFT Bord2 → Vectgr C . The fact that H ¯∂(U ) is only graded commutative can be traced back to the supersymmetry of the original sigma model. To Var one can associate the defect data D B given by D B 2 = Obj(Var), D B 1 = {Obj(Var(U, V ))}U,V ∈DB 2 and obvious source and target maps. Then it is natural to conjecture that there is a defect TQFT Z B : Borddef 2 (D B) → Vectgr C whose associated 2-category BZ B is equivalent to Var. Furthermore, taking products of varieties gives Var a monoidal structure. 2.4.3 Symplectic geometry Another geometric example is the pivotal bicategory Symp, which is “dual” to Var in the sense that it is believed to arise from a defect TQFT that collects all A-twisted sigma models. (For the subbicategories of Calabi-Yau varieties this relation is expected to be a generalisation of mirror symmetry.) The bicategory Symp is discussed in detail in the review article [Weh, Sect. 3.5]. Objects are symplectic manifolds M ≡ (M, ω), and one writes M − = (M, −ω) for the reversed symplectic structure. 1-morphisms M → N are Lagrangian correspondences L, 22 i. e. chains of Lagrangian submanifolds Li,j ⊂ M − i × Mj of the form L1,2 L2,3 Lk−1,k M = M1 M2 M3 · · · Mk−1 Mk = N while 2-morphisms form the quilted Floer homology groups Hom(L, L ′) = HF (L, L ′). Hence the categories of 1-morphisms in Symp are Donaldson-Fukaya categories. The left and right adjoint of L = (L1,2, L2,3, . . . , Lk−1,k) is the reversed corre- spondence LT = (L T k−1,k, L T k−2,k−1, . . . , LT 1,2), where L T i,j ⊂ M − j × Mi is the image of Li,j under the transposition Mi × Mj → Mj × Mi. Taking products of sym- plectic manifolds makes Symp a monoidal 2-category. 2.4.4 Landau-Ginzburg models That left and right adjoints agree only up to a certain twist is a common phe- nomenon, which was formalised and called ‘graded pivotal’ in [CM2, Def. 7.1]. An example of such a graded pivotal bicategory is that of (aﬃne) Landau- Ginzburg models LG. Its objects are isolated singularities, i. e. polynomials W ∈ C[x1, . . . , xn] for some n ∈ N such that the Jacobi ring JacW := C[x1, . . . , xn]/(∂x1W, . . . , ∂xnW ) is ﬁnite-dimensional over C.6 A 1-morphism from W ∈ C[x1, . . . , xn] ≡ C[x] to V ∈ C[z1, . . . , zm] ≡ C[z] is a matrix factorisation X of V − W . This means that X is a free ﬁnite-rank Z2-graded C[z, x]-module X = X 0 ⊕ X 1 together with an odd map dX ∈ End 1 C[z,x](X) such that d2 X = (V − W ) · 1X. A 2-morphism between X, Y ∈ LG(W, V ) is an even C[z, x]-linear map Φ : X → Y up to homotopy with respect to the twisted diﬀerentials dX and dY . If one chooses bases of X and Y , then dX, dY and Φ are represented by odd and even matrices, respectively. Horizontal composition in LG is given by tensoring over the intermediate polynomial ring.7 The unit 1W is a deformation of the Koszul complex of (∂x1W, . . . , ∂xnW ), which in the simplest case of W = xd means that d1W is represented by the matrix ( 0 x−x′ (xd−x′d)/(x−x′) 0 ). In general one ﬁnds that End(1W ) ∼= JacW . Not only horizontal composition, but also adjunctions in LG are under very good control. Up to a shift, †X and X † are simply given by HomC[z,x](X, C[z, x]), 6In fact there is a graded pivotal bicategory LGk for any commutative ring k as explained in [CM2], but the ﬁniteness condition on its objects is more involved for k ̸= C. 7This can be algorithmically computed by splitting an idempotent [DM], which was used in [CM1] to compute the homological knot invariants of Khovanov and Rozansky [KR]. 23 but also the adjunction maps evX, coevX etc. were computed explicitly in terms of Atiyah classes in [CM2]. In this way we could show that LG is graded piv- otal. Furthermore, one obtains neat formulas for quantum dimension and traces (recall (2.8) and (2.9)), for example dimr(X) = (−1)( m+1 2 ) ResC[x,z]/C[z] [ str ( ∂x1dX . . . ∂xndX ∂z1dX . . . ∂zmdX) dx ∂x1W . . . ∂xnW ] where X ∈ LG(W, V ) is as above. Using the construction of [Shu] one may verify that LG is a monoidal bicategory, where the tensor product of W ∈ C[x] with V ∈ C[z] is W + V ∈ C[z, x], and 0 ∈ C is the monoidal unit. It is expected (but not proven) that there exists a defect TQFT Z LG : Bord def 2 (D LG) → VectZ2 k such that LGk is equivalent to the 2-category BZ LG associated to Z LG. 2.4.5 Diﬀerential graded categories Twisted sigma models and Landau-Ginzburg models ﬁt into a larger framework of diﬀerential graded (dg) categories [To¨e]. Indeed, there is a bicategory DGsat k whose objects are ‘saturated’ dg categories, and whose 1- and 2-morphisms are certain resolutions of dg functors and natural transformations, respectively. Every object U ∈ Var, M ∈ Symp, or W ∈ LG can be viewed as an object in DGsat k by taking the unique dg enhancemens of D(U ), Symp(pt, M ), or LG(0, W ), respectively. Then the bicategories Var, Symp and LG are quasi-equivalent to the (distinct) corresponding full subbicategories of DGsat k . More generally, one might think of DGsat k as the bicategory of TQFTs arising from topologically twisting N = (2, 2) supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theories. Working in the enlarged framework of DGsat k also has the advantage of com- paring sigma models and Landau-Ginzburg models in a more natural context. In particular, homological mirror symmetry is a statement internal to DGsat k , and it is tempting to speculate that there is a truly 2-categorical generalisation of mirror symmetry, taking place in a suitable enlargement of DGsat k .8 As shown in [BFK, App. A.2], DGsat k is equivalent to the more manageable bicategory DGsp k of smooth and proper dg algebras. The 1-morphisms M : A → B in DGsp k are perfect dg (A op ⊗k B)-bimodules, i. e. HomD(Aop⊗kB)(M, −) commutes with arbitrary coproducts, and 2-morphisms are maps of dg bimodules up to quasi-isomorphisms. Horizontal composition is the left-derived tensor product over the intermediate algebra. It follows from the discussion in [BFK] that DGsp k is graded pivotal, and analogously to the situation in Sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.4, adjoints are given by the naive dual together with a twist by Serre functors. Tensoring over the ﬁeld k gives the bicategories DGsat k and DGsp k a natural monoidal structure [To¨e]. 8The process of orbifold completion discussed in Section 2.4.8 below may play a role here. 24 2.4.6 Categoriﬁed quantum groups Pivotal 2-categories also feature prominently in higher representation theory (see e. g. [Lau2, Sect. 1] for a gentle introduction), which in turn plays a unifying role in the theory of homological link invariants. A key idea behind ‘2-Kac-Moody algebras’ [Rou] and ‘categoriﬁed quantum groups’ [Lau1, KL] is to represent them not on vector spaces, but on linear categories. This leads one to replace the (quantum) Serre relations, which are equalities between expressions involving the generators Ei, Fj, by natural transformations ηk between the corresponding expressions of functors Ei, Fj. This theory is considerably richer than its classical counterpart, partly because of nontrivial relations which have to be imposed on the ηk. Associated to any Kac-Moody algebra g there is a k-linear pivotal 2-category UQ(g). The precise deﬁnition ﬁlls several pages (cf. the above references), but here is a sketch: First one picks a ‘Cartan datum and choice of scalars Q’; this in particular gives a weight lattice X with simple roots αi, and a symmetrisable generalised Cartan matrix. Objects of UQ(g) are simply weights λ ∈ X, and 1-morphisms are formal polynomials in expressions of the form 1λ , 1λ+αiEi = 1λ+αiEi1λ = Ei1λ , 1λ−αiFi = 1λ−αiFi1λ = Fi1λ . 2-morphisms are k-spans of compositions of certain string diagrams which encode the categoriﬁcation of the Serre relations for g, subject to a list of relations. These relations in particular describe biadjunctions (again up to shifts) between Ei1λ and Fi1λ. As explained in [BHLW], the parameters Q can be chosen such that these adjunctions become a strictly pivotal structure on UQ(g). It is an open problem to determine whether there is a natural monoidal structure on UQ(g). 2.4.7 Surface defects in 3-dimensional TQFT One generally expects n-dimensional TQFTs to appear as defects of codimen- sion 1 in (n + 1)-dimensional TQFTs. At least for n = 2 this is a rigorous result also from the algebraic perspective: In [CMS] we introduced 3-dimensional defect TQFTs Z, from which we went on to construct a certain type of 3-category TZ. More precisely, TZ is a k-linear ‘Gray category with duals’ – categorifying the construction of Section 2.3. This implies in particular that TZ(u, v) is a k-linear pivotal 2-category for all u, v ∈ TZ. And since the objects (interpreted as ‘sur- face defects’) of TZ(u, v) are the 1-morphisms of a 3-category, TZ(u, v) is monoidal whenever u = v. 2.4.8 Orbifold completion As a ﬁnal source of pivotal 2-categories we point to the procedure of ‘orbifold completion’ of [CR]. Inspired by the orbifold construction from ﬁnite group 25 actions and their generalisation in rational conformal ﬁeld theory [FFRS], orbifold completion takes a pivotal bicategory B as input and produces a new pivotal bicategory Borb, into which B fully embeds. It is a completion because there is an equivalence (Borb)orb ∼= Borb. Objects of Borb are pairs (α, A) where α ∈ B and A is a separable symmetric Frobenius algebra – not necessarily in Vectk, but in the category B(α, α). A 1-morphism (α, A) → (β, B) in Borb is a 1-morphism X ∈ B(α, β) together with the structure of a B-A-bimodule, and 2-morphisms are those in B which are also bimodule maps. Horizontal composition is the tensor product over the intermediate algebra, and 1(α,A) = A viewed as an A-A-bimodule. The simplest case of orbifold completion reproduces state sum models. Here as the input bicategory B one takes the ‘trivial’ bicategory BVectk which has a single object with Vectk as its endomorphism category. Then by construction and in the notation of Section 2.4.1 we have ssFrobk ∼= (BVectk)orb . Examples of separable Frobenius algebras which do not live in Vectk are pro- vided by group actions. For a ﬁnite group G and some pivotal bicategory B, let Dg ∈ B(α, α) for all g ∈ G such that Dg ⊗ Dh ∼= Dgh coherently, and let B(α, α) have ﬁnite sums. Then there are as many inequivalent separable Frobenius alge- bras structures on AG := ⊕ g∈G Dg as there are elements in H 2(G, k ×) [BCP2], and AG is symmetric if its Nakayama automorphism is the identity. Interestingly, not all separable Frobenius algebras come from group actions, cf. [CRCR]. The adjoint of X ∈ Borb((α, A), (β, B)) is †X = X † ∈ B(β, α) together with the adjunction maps evX = A X†X ◦ ξ , coevX = ϑ ◦ B X †X where ξ : †X ⊗B X → †X ⊗ X and ϑ : X ⊗ †X → X ⊗A †X are the splitting and projection maps (which we require to exist, cf. [CR, Lem. 2.3]). In fact, this continues to hold if A and B are not required to be symmetric, but then their actions on †X and X † are twisted by Nakayama automorphisms as explained in [CR, Sec. 4.3], generalising the situation with Serre functors in Sections 2.4.2, 2.4.4 and 2.4.5, see [BCP1, CQV]. If B is monoidal then Borb is expected to be monoidal as well. One may either argue along the lines of [Shu], or via a universal property for the operation (−)orb. 26 3 Open/closed TQFTs from pivotal 2-categories In Section 2.1.1 we easily obtained closed and open/closed TQFTs from defect TQFTs, simply by forgetting part of the structure of the defect bordism category Bord def 2 (D). In the present section we elucidate this relation by constructing an open/closed TQFT from any object in a k-linear pivotal bicategory (satisfying two natural assumptions). We treat the purely closed case in Section 3.1, and the fully open/closed case in Section 3.3. The algebraic description of open/closed TQFTs in terms of Calabi-Yau categories is reviewed in Section 3.2. 3.1 Closed TQFTs from pivotal 2-categories For completeness, we brieﬂy recall how closed TQFTs Z c : Bord2 → Vectk are equivalent to commutative Frobenius algebras in Vectk. By a classical result [Koc], the bordism category Bord2 is generated by , , , , (3.1) where from now on in-coming/out-going boundaries are placed at the bottom/top of pictures of bordisms. The relations between the generators (3.1) precisely say that the vector space Z c(S1) together with multiplication Z c( ), unit Z c( )(1) and pairing Z c( ) ◦ Z c( ) is a commutative Frobenius algebra. Given a k-linear pivotal bicategory B, we would now like to construct a com- mutative Frobenius algebra Aα naturally associated to every object α ∈ B. Our interpretation (2.10) of such bicategories in the context of defect TQFT suggests that the underlying vector space of Aα should be the space of endomorphisms of the unit 1α: Aα = End(1α) . Indeed, we interpret 1α as the invisible defect, and elements φ ∈ End(1α) corre- spond to operators living on an invisible line with no further ‘defect conditions’: α φ ∈ End(1α) . Hence in standard jargon, φ is a ﬁeld ‘inserted in the bulk’ of the ‘theory’ α. As the 2-endomorphism space in a k-linear bicategory, Aα is manifestly an associative unital k-algebra. Furthermore, using the interchange law (2.3) one can show that in any monoidal category the endomorphisms of the unit form a commutative monoid [EGNO, Prop. 2.2.10]. It remains to endow Aα with a nondegenerate pairing which is compatible with multiplication. There are various ways to ensure the existence of such a pairing. We will see how it follows from 27 Assumption 3.1. The k-linear pivotal bicategory B is monoidal 9 with duals such that B(O, O) ∼= Vectk, where O ∈ B is the unit object. We observe that all our examples in Section 2.4 are known or expected to satisfy this condition. Further we recall that as noted after Theorem 2.1 it is natural to expect the bicategories arising from defect TQFTs to come with a monoidal structure: for α, β ∈ B their tensor product α ˜ β corresponds to the ‘tensor product theory’ attached to the fusion of two bordism patches labelled α and β. The unit O ∈ B corresponds to the ‘trivial theory’. This is consistent with AO = End(1O) ∼= k being the trivial commutative Frobenius algebras in Vectk ∼= B(O, O). Finally, the dual α# of an object α ∈ B is interpreted as a label for a bordism patch with opposite orientation. How can we endow Aα = End(1α) with a nondegenerate pairing using Assump- tion 3.1? Recall that the pairing of the Frobenius algebra associated to a closed TQFT Z c is the ‘sphere correlator’ Z c( ) ◦ Z c( ) = Z c( ) : Z c(S1) ⊗k Z c(S1) −→ k . From a bicategory B as in Assumption 3.1 we can build such pairings by mim- icking the above construction as follows. We consider a sphere S2 labelled by α ∈ B. Then we project the sphere onto some plane, producing a disc: α −→ α ˜ α# The disc is labelled by the product α ˜ α# because the rear part of the sphere has opposite orientation with respect to the plane. We now interpret the disc as a string diagram in B! The preimage of the disc’s boundary is simply the great circle on the sphere which is parallel to the chosen projection plane. Since any plane will do, this great circle is nothing special – in fact it is invisible on the sphere. Hence we label it with the ‘invisible defect’ 1α ∈ B(α, α). Labelling the inside and outside of the sphere with the trivial object O, the boundary of the disc is labelled by the 1-morphism ̃1α ∈ B( O, α ˜ α#) 9Monoidal bicategories are deﬁned for example in [SP] or [Shu]. By a ‘monoidal bicategory with duals’ we mean a ‘Gray category with duals and only a single object’ as deﬁned e. g. in [BMS, Sect. 3.3] or [CMS, Sect. 3.2.2]. 28 corresponding to 1α under duality in B. So ﬁnally the ‘sphere correlator’ for Aα = End(1α) is deﬁned to be 〈−, − 〉 α : Aα ⊗k Aα −→ k , φ1 ⊗φ2 ↦−→ α ˜ α# ̃1α ̃φ1 ̃φ2 ∈ End(1O) ∼= k (3.2) where the string diagram represents the map eṽ1α ◦ (1̃1α ⊗ ̃φ1 ̃φ2) ◦ ˜coeṽ1α : k → k, i. e. the trace trl(̃φ1 ̃φ2). Thus the pairing ⟨−, −⟩α is manifestly compatible with multiplication, and it follows from Theorem 3.6 below that ⟨−, −⟩α is nondegen- erate. Hence we have arrived at a closed TQFT: Theorem 3.2. Let B be a bicategory satisfying Assumption 3.1. Then for every α ∈ B, the vector space End(1α) naturally has the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra. 3.2 Open/closed TQFTs and Calabi-Yau categories An open/closed TQFT [Laz, MS, LP1] is a symmetric monoidal functor Z oc : Bord oc 2 (B) −→ Vectk (3.3) where B is some set, whose elements are referred to as boundary conditions. The objects of the bordism category Bord oc 2 (B) are disjoint unions of circles S1 and unit intervals Iab whose endpoints are labelled by a, b ∈ B: Iab = b a . Morphisms in Bord oc 2 (B) are bordism classes generated by the list (3.1) together with the classes of the following decorated manifolds with corners for all a, b, c, d ∈ B: c b b a ac , cbba a c , a a , aa , a b c d c d a b , a a , aa (3.4) subject to the relations (3.5)–(3.12) below as well as the relations for which state that together with the twist , the category Bordoc 2 (B) has a symmetric monoidal structure. It follows that Bord2 is a non-full subcategory of Bordoc 2 (B). 29 The relations on the generators (3.4) are the intuitively clear equalities = , = , (3.5) = = , = = , (3.6) = = , (3.7) = , (3.8) = , = , (3.9) = , (3.10) = , (3.11) as well as bb aa = b b a a , (3.12) 30 which can be understood as the sequence of diﬀeomorphisms bb aa = bb aa = a a b b = bb aa = bb aa = b b a a . (3.13) With the bordism category Bordoc 2 (B) under explicit control, we now review how to equivalently encode the functor (3.3) in algebraic terms. 3.2.1 Closed sector Restricting an open/closed TQFT Z oc as in (3.3) to the subcategory Bord2 ⊂ Bord oc 2 (B) produces a closed TQFT. Hence Z oc(S1) has the structure of a com- mutative Frobenius algebra A c. We write 〈 −, − 〉c : A c ⊗k A c −→ k (3.14) for its nondegenerate pairing. 3.2.2 Open sector Let Bord o 2(B) be the subcategory of Bordoc 2 (B) whose objects are only labelled intervals (and no circles), and whose morphisms are generated by the ﬁrst ﬁve bordisms in (3.4), subject to (3.5)–(3.8) and the twist relations. By deﬁnition an open TQFT is a symmetric monoidal functor Bordo 2(B) → Vectk. We construct a category Co from Z oc restricted to Bordo 2(B) as follows. The set of objects is the set of boundary conditions, Obj(Co) = B , and Hom spaces are what Z oc assigns to labelled intervals, Hom(a, b) = Z oc( b a ). Composition is deﬁned to be Z oc ( c b b a ac ) : Hom(b, c) × Hom(a, b) −→ Hom(a, c) . It is associative by relation (3.5) and unital thanks to (3.6). This establishes that Co is a k-linear category. 31 The relations (3.7) and (3.8) endow Co with additional structure. For all a, b ∈ B there are k-linear pairings 〈−, −〉 ab = Z oc ( a b b a ) : Hom(b, a) ⊗k Hom(a, b) −→ k . (3.15) By relation (3.8) these pairings are symmetric in the sense that ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩ab = ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩ba, and they are nondegenerate since = according to (3.6) and (3.7). Finally, the pairings are compatible with multipli- cation, ⟨Φ1, Φ2Φ3⟩ab = ⟨Φ1Φ2, Φ3⟩ac, by deﬁnition of the pairing and associativ- ity (3.5). It follows from the above that the vector spaces End(a) have the structure of a symmetric Frobenius algebra. Hence one can think of Co as ‘many Frobe- nius algebras glued together’. Unfortunately, the name ‘Frobenius category’ was already taken, 10 and instead the term ‘Calabi-Yau’ category is used. To give the deﬁnition we ﬁrst broaden the context. A Serre functor on a k-linear category C is a functor Σ : C → C together with isomorphisms ηab : Hom (a, b ) ∼= −→ Hom( b, Σ(a) )∗ which are natural in a, b ∈ C. From this one obtains the nondegenerate Serre pairings 〈 −, − 〉 ab : Hom (b, Σ(a) ) ⊗k Hom( a, b ) −→ k , Ψ ⊗ Φ ↦−→ ηaa(1a)(ΨΦ) by duality. By deﬁnition a Calabi-Yau category is a k-linear category C together with a trivial Serre functor Σ = 1C. (If C is a triangulated category, then the Serre functor may be the identity only up to a shift.) The eponymous example of a (triangulated) Calabi-Yau category is the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau variety. Indeed, as was noted in Section 2.4.2, the Serre functor on D b(coh(U )) for any smooth and proper variety U is ΣU ∼= ωU [dimC U ] ⊗C (−). But U is Calabi-Yau iﬀ the canonical line bundle ωU is trivial. In light of the results of Section 3.3 below, Section 2.4 provides many further examples of Calabi-Yau categories. It follows that the category Co we constructed from the open TQFT Z oc|Bord o 2(B) is Calabi-Yau with Serre pairings (3.15). It was shown in [Laz, MS, LP1] that the converse is also true: 10A Frobenius category is a Quillen exact category with enough injectives and enough projec- tives, such that injectives and projectives coincide. 32 Theorem 3.3. The above construction is an equivalence of groupoids between open TQFTs and Calabi-Yau categories. 3.2.3 Open/closed sector It remains to work out the algebraic meaning of the last two generators in (3.4) as well as their relations (3.9)–(3.12). For this, we ﬁrst deﬁne the bulk-boundary maps to be βa := Z oc( a a ) : A c −→ End(a) for all a ∈ B. It maps the closed sector (or ‘bulk theory’) to the open sector (with ‘boundary condition’ a). Due to relations (3.9) and (3.10), βa is a map of algebras into the centre of End(a), i. e. βa(φ) Ψ = Ψ βa(φ) for all φ ∈ A c and Ψ ∈ End(a). Furthermore, the boundary-bulk map (which need not be a map of algebras) βa := Z oc( aa ) : End(a) −→ A c is adjoint to βa with respect to the Frobenius pairings by (3.11): 〈βa(Ψ), φ 〉c = 〈Ψ, βa(φ) 〉 aa . The most interesting condition on the maps βa derives from (3.12). For Φ ∈ End(a) and Ψ ∈ End(b) let us consider the map ΨmΦ : Hom(a, b) −→ Hom(a, b) , Ω ↦−→ ΨΩΦ . Note that for Φ = Ψ = 1a ∈ End(a), the map 1am1a is simply the identity operator on End(a). Then for any open/closed TQFT Z oc as above we have: Theorem 3.4 (Cardy condition). Let Φ ∈ End(a) and Ψ ∈ End(b). Then tr ( ΨmΦ) = 〈βb(Ψ), βa(Φ) 〉c . (3.16) The signiﬁcance of the Cardy condition is that a trace in the open sector can be computed from a pairing in the closed sector. The qualiﬁer ‘theorem’ is more than appropriate: as shown in [CW], in the special case of the Calabi-Yau category being of the form D b(coh(U )), the Cardy condition is the Hirzebruch-Riemann- Roch theorem! 33 To prove Theorem 3.4 we use duality to rewrite (3.13) as b b a a = b b aa . (3.17) Let us choose bases {ei} and {̃ei} of Hom(a, b) and Hom(b, a), respectively, such that we have Z oc( )(1) = ∑ i ̃ei ⊗ ei for the copairing. Then thanks to (3.6) and (3.7) the basis {e∗ i = ⟨̃ei, −⟩ab} is dual to {ei}, and we compute tr (ΨmΦ) = ∑ i e ∗ i (ΨeiΦ ) = ∑ i 〈̃ei, ΨeiΦ 〉 ab = Z oc(LHS of (3.17))(Ψ ⊗ Φ) = Z oc(RHS of (3.17))(Ψ ⊗ Φ) = 〈βb(Ψ), βa(Φ) 〉c. In summary, a 2-dimensional open/closed TQFT has the following algebraic description, generalising the fact that closed TQFTs are equivalent to commuta- tive Frobenius algebras: Theorem 3.5. The construction reviewed in this section gives an equivalence between open/closed TQFTs and the following data: • a commutative Frobenius algebra Ac with nondegenerate pairing ⟨−, −⟩ c, • a Calabi-Yau category Co, • k-linear maps βa : A c ⇄ End(a) : βa for all a ∈ Co, such that (i) βa are algebra maps with image in the centre, (ii) βa and βa are adjoint with respect to the Frobenius pairings, (iii) the Cardy condition tr ( ΨmΦ) = 〈βb(Ψ), βa(Φ) 〉c holds for all Φ ∈ End(a) and Ψ ∈ End(b) in Co. 34 3.3 Open/closed TQFTs from pivotal 2-categories In Section 3.1 we constructed a closed TQFT for every object α in a bicategory B satisfying Assumption 3.1. Now we complete the construction by assigning an open/closed TQFT to every α ∈ B. 3.3.1 Open sector The natural starting point for the open sector is the category Cα = B(O, α) (3.18) of 1-morphisms between α and the ‘trivial theory’, i. e. the monoidal unit O ∈ B. In the interpretation of 1-morphisms as defect lines it is immediate to view them as boundary conditions: α O We claim that (3.18) comes with the structure of a Calabi-Yau category. It certainly is k-linear, but where are the nondegenerate pairings? They are encoded in the duality structure of B together with the assumption B(O, O) ∼= Vectk. Indeed, for X, Y ∈ B(O, α) we have X † ⊗ Y ∈ Vectk , hence the Zorro moves for X † ⊗ Y tell us that (X † ⊗ Y )†X † ⊗ Y : (X † ⊗ Y ) ⊗k (X † ⊗ Y )† −→ k is a nondegenerate pairing. Precomposing with the isomorphism Y † X (X † ⊗ Y )† : Y † ⊗ X −→ ( X † ⊗ Y )† and using the Zorro move for X † ⊗ Y again, we obtain the nondegenerate pairing Y †Y XX † : ( X † ⊗ Y ) ⊗k (Y † ⊗ X) −→ k . (3.19) 35 To translate the above into a pairing in Cα, we use the isomorphism of vector spaces Hom(X, Y ) ∼= −→ X † ⊗ Y , ↦−→ (3.20) with inverse ↦−→ . Precomposing (3.19) with (3.20) we obtain the Serre pairing 〈−, −〉α Y X : Hom(X, Y ) ⊗k Hom(Y, X) −→ k with 〈Φ, Ψ 〉α Y X = α X Φ Ψ = α X ΨΦ = α Y ΦΨ . Since this is the left trace (recall (2.9)) of ΨΦ ∈ End(X), the pairings ⟨−, −⟩ α Y X are symmetric: ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩ α Y X = ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩ α XY . In summary, we have proved Theorem 3.6. Let B be a bicategory satisfying Assumption 3.1. Then for every α ∈ B, the category B(O, α) naturally has the structure of a Calabi-Yau category with pairing 〈−, −〉α Y X : Hom(X, Y ) ⊗k Hom(Y, X) −→ k , 〈 Φ, Ψ 〉α Y X = α Y ΦΨ . Recall that for the closed sector Aα = End(1α) in Section 3.1, the nondegener- ate pairing (3.2) was the ‘sphere correlator projected to a disc’. But in the open sector the role of the sphere correlator is played by the disc correlator – so we could have guessed the result of Theorem 3.6 from the start! 3.3.2 Open/closed sector We continue to work with a bicategory B satisfying Assumption 3.1. For every α ∈ B we have already obtained a commutative Frobenius algebra Aα = End(1α) and a Calabi-Yau category Cα = B(O, α). According to Theorem 3.5, we also need maps βX : Aα End(X) : βX 36 for all X ∈ Cα in order to associate an open/closed TQFT to α. In the graphical calculus, intuition about these maps becomes a rigorous deﬁnition: we set the bulk-boundary map to be βX : End(1α) −→ End(X) , α φ ↦−→ α φ X , (3.21) and the boundary-bulk map is βX : End(X) −→ End(1α) , α Ψ X X ↦−→ X Ψ α . (3.22) We have to check that the maps βX, βX satisfy the three conditions (i)–(iii) in Theorem 3.5. The ﬁrst one is easy: βX is manifestly an algebra map into the centre, thanks to the coherence theorem behind the graphical calculus. To prove conditions (ii) and (iii), we make one additional assumption. For motivation, recall that we obtained the nondegenerate pairing ⟨−, −⟩α on Aα in (3.2) by projecting an α-decorated sphere onto a plane. Now we consider a sphere with two incoming boundary circles cut out, together with a D-decorated defect line which separates two phases labelled α and β as follows: β αD By isotopically deforming the defect line we obtain the identity = in the defect bordism category. Hence we expect the following property for the bicategory B = BZ associated to a defect TQFT: Assumption 3.7. For every D ∈ B(α, β) and Ψ ∈ End(D), the pairings ⟨−, −⟩α on End(1α) satisfy 〈 βα D Ψ 〉 α = 〈 α β D Ψ 〉 β , (3.23) 37 where we write ⟨φ⟩α for ⟨φ, 1⟩α. Under this assumption we can verify condition (ii) of Theorem 3.5 in just one line. Let φ ∈ End(1α), X ∈ B(O, α) and Ψ ∈ End(X). Then 〈βX(φ), Ψ 〉 XX = X βX (φ)Ψ = 〈 X βX (φ)Ψ 〉 O = 〈 X Ψ φ 〉 α = 〈φ, βX(Ψ) 〉c so indeed βX and βX are adjoint with respect to one another. At last we prove the Cardy condition. Let X, Y ∈ B(O, α), Φ ∈ End(X) and Ψ ∈ End(Y ). Then 〈βX(Φ), βY (Ψ) 〉 α (3.22) = 〈 X Φ Y Ψ 〉 α (3.23) = 〈 Y Ψ X Φ 〉 O = Y Ψ X Φ Zorro = X Y X † ⊗Y Ψ Φ† (2.7) = X Y X † ⊗Y Ψ Φ† Zorro = Φ† ⊗ Ψ = tr (ΨmΦ) . To understand the last step, pick a basis {ei} of X † ⊗ Y ∈ Vectk, and write {e∗ i } for the dual basis. The canonical isomorphisms X † ⊗ Y ∼= Hom(X, Y ) and 38 (X † ⊗ Y ) ∗ ∼= Hom(X, Y )∗ act as ei ↦−→ ei =: ai , e∗ i ↦−→ − e∗ i =: a∗ i , respectively. The Zorro move tells us that a∗ j (ai) = δij, so {a∗ i } is dual to the basis {ai} of Hom(X, Y ). Hence we compute Φ† ⊗ Ψ = ∑ i e∗ i (( Φ† ⊗ Ψ )ei) = ∑ i e∗ i ei Φ† Ψ = ∑ i e∗ i ei Ψ Φ = ∑ i a∗ i ( ΨaiΦ) = tr ( ΨmΦ) . This completes our construction of an open/closed TQFT from α: Theorem 3.8. Let B be a bicategory satisfying Assumptions 3.1 and 3.7. Then by the above construction for every α ∈ B we have that • End(1α) has the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra, • B(O, α) has the structure of a Calabi-Yau category, • for every X ∈ B(O, α), the maps βX : End(1α) ⇄ End(X) : βX of (3.21) and (3.22) satisfy the conditions in Theorem 3.5.
