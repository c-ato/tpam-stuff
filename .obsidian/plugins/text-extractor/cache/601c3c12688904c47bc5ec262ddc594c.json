(a) Deﬁne what is meant by the terms stable ﬁxed point, unstable ﬁxed point, stable 2-cycle and unstable 2-cycle of an iterated map, xn+1 = f (xn). State the conditions for stability and instability of a ﬁxed point. Deduce from these the corresponding conditions for stability and instability of a 2-cycle. [4] Consider the iterated map deﬁned on the interval 0 ≤ x < ∞ by xn+1 = f (x) = rxn 1 + x3 , where 0 ≤ r < ∞ is a variable parameter. (b) Find the ﬁxed points of this map, and analyse their existence and stability as the parameter r is varied. [2] (c) Show that the equation f (f (x)) = x can be rewritten in the form z3 − r2z2 + r3z − r3 = 0, where z = 1 + x3, if we assume that x ̸= 0. [1] (d) Show that the two elements of the 2-cycle satisfy the quadratic equation z2 + (r − r2)z + r2 = 0. Use this equation to ﬁnd the 2-cycle, and investigate its stability as a function of parameter r. [3] 2 (TURN OVER) A19919 Any Calculator 2. The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model is given by the differential equations dR dt = aR − bRF, dF dt = −cF + dRF, where R(t) and F (t) are the rabbit and fox populations at time t, and a, b, c, d are positive constants. (a) Explain the biological meaning of each of the four terms aR, −bRF , −cF and dRF in the model [2] (b) Show that the model can be recast in the dimensionless form dx ds = x(1 − y), dy ds = µy(x − 1), by setting R = αx, F = βy, and t = γs. Write α, β, γ, and µ in terms of a, b, c, and d. [2] (c) Show that the quantity E = µ(x − ln x) + (y − ln y) is a conserved quantity for this model. [2] (d) Show that (0, 0) and (1, 1) are ﬁxed points of the system. Show that sufﬁ- ciently near to (0, 0) the phase curves can be approximated by xµy = const, whilst sufﬁciently near to (1, 1) they can be approximated by µ(x − 1)2 + (y − 1)2 = const. [Hint: Use the result that ln z → −∞ and ln (1 + z) ≈ z − z2/2 when z → 0.] [4] 3 (TURN OVER) A19919 Any Calculator 3. (a) Deﬁne what is meant by self-similarity, and give an example of where it may be seen in a system that also exhibits chaos. [2] (b) Show that a square has fractal dimension 2, using a method which may also be used for non-integer dimensions. Carefully explain the steps in your calcu- [2] A fractal is constructed as shown in the following ﬁgure for iterations n = 1 and 3. (c) Sketch the construction that will correspond to n = 2, and describe the steps that are involved in generating the fractal from iteration n to n + 1. [2] (d) Find the fractal dimension of the construction, and comment on the result in comparison to other simpler geometric constructions. [2] (e) Construct a fractal with fractal dimension less than 1. Explain clearly the iteration process, and determine the fractal dimension of your construction.
