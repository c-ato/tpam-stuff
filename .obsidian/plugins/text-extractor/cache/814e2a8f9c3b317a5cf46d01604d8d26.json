𝐸 = 𝑛𝜀 2 Q: How much energy do we need to remove 1 mole of (connected) atoms from the centre of the structure? 𝐸 = 𝑛𝑁𝐴𝜀 2 where the factor of two comes from avoiding double-counting bonds (as in the diatomic system) --- or a mole consists of NA/2 pairs This assumes kinetic energy of particles is small compared to potential energy (i.e. low temperature) Measurement of an atom’s size (latent heat) Latent heat of vaporisation, L, (J/kg): the amount of heat required to completely vaporise a liquid into a gas (at a constant temperature). 𝐿 = 10 Τ𝑈0 2 × (number of atoms per kg) Q: How much energy do we need to remove 1 mole of (connected) atoms from the centre of the structure? 𝐸 = 𝑛𝑁𝐴𝜀 2 Amount of substance (moles) = Number of particles 𝑁𝐴 Specific latent heat -> per kg Molar latent heat -> per mol 𝑁𝐴 = 𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠 𝑚𝑜𝑙 What about high temperatures? Higher kinetic energy increases average bond length – more repulsion when close than attraction when apart For water What about the surface? Q: Does the particle at the surface or the particle deeper within the liquid experience a greater potential? A: The particle deeper within the liquid What about the surface? Q: What is the number of nearest neighbours for the particle on the surface if the deeper particle has 10 nearest neighbours? A: 5 ( 10 2 ) What about the surface? V = n𝜀/4 V = n𝜀/2 Need to do n𝜀/4 amount of work to bring deeper particle to surface Surface tension Define a quantity called surface tension, γ, which is the amount of work done needed to move 1 m2 of particles, 𝑁, to the surface of a liquid from deeper inside: γ = 𝑛𝜀 2 − 𝑛𝜀 4 × N Potential deep in liquid Surface tension Define a quantity called surface tension, γ, which is the amount of work done needed to move 1 m2 of particles, 𝑁, to the surface of a liquid from deeper inside: γ = 𝑛𝜀 2 − 𝑛𝜀 4 × N Potential at surface Surface tension Define a quantity called surface tension, γ, which is the amount of work done needed to move 1 m2 of particles, 𝑁, to the surface of a liquid from deeper inside: γ = 𝑛𝜀 2 − 𝑛𝜀 4 × N Number of particles per m2 Surface tension Define a quantity called surface tension, γ, which is the amount of work done needed to move 1 m2 of particles, 𝑁, to the surface of a liquid from deeper inside: γ = 𝑛𝜀 2 − 𝑛𝜀 4 × N = 𝑛𝜀𝑁 4 Units of energy over area (or force over length) Surface tension https://www.thoughtco.com/surface-tension-definition-and-experiments-2699204 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Surface _Tension_Diagram.svg/1280px-Surface_Tension_Diagram.svg.png The mass of the insect wants to break the surface of the water, but the work that would need to be done to produce more surface not achievable by the gravitational potential energy The force exerted by the liquid (tangential to its surface) that opposes the stretching of the surface is larger than the force of gravity acting on the insect Easy to consider in terms of both forces and potentials! Surface tension Oof Surface tension has units of energy over area, or force over length The force due to surface tension acts parallel to the surface of the liquid, but perpendicular to the division we are trying to create by exerting a separate force on the liquid Surface tension Surface tension has units of energy over area, or force over length The force due to surface tension acts parallel to the surface of the liquid, but perpendicular to the division we are trying to create by exerting a separate force on the liquid EZ go next Any other consequences?

Strong adhesive forces cause liquid to stick to the sides of the container: concave meniscus Strong cohesive forces causes minimisation of surface area: convex meniscus Capillary action Open tube placed in contact with the surface of a liquid causes the liquid to rise up the tube Competing forces/potentials: 1) Gravity of the liquid 2) Surface tension – total surface energy is reduced as adhesion contributes to liquid in the tube θ 2r h ℎ = 2𝛾 cos 𝜃 𝜌𝑔𝑟 Credit: Dr. Keith Hayward https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/narrower-tube-openings-allow-capillary-action-pull-water-higher https://scienceexperiments101.weebly.com/uploads/6/1/3/6/61367479/8158502_orig.jpg https://www.zurich.com/en/media/magazine/2021/can-reforestation-uproot-climate-change Summary Looked at the relationship between the microscopic quantity of the energy to separate two particles and how it can be extended to macroscopic quantities (latent heats) Discussed the underlying physics behind surface tension from microscopic behaviour Learnt about cohesion and adhesion in the context of liquids, as well as capillary action","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
