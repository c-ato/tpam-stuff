A statistical collection of energies for particles that make up the system for which we are measuring the temperature Temperature scales Fahrenheit (°F, F-tier) Celsius (°C, B-tier) Kelvin (K, S-tier) Note the lack of a degrees sign °F -> °C: 𝑥 − 32 × 5 9 https://phys.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/7851/CNX_UPhysics_18_02_Scales.jpg?revision=1 °C -> K: 𝑥 + 273.15 Temperature scales (cursed) Rankine (like Fahrenheit meets Kelvin, but even less useful because not even Americans use it): °𝑅 = °𝐹 + 459.67 Temperature scales (cursed) Newton scale: https://httprover2.blogspot.com/2017/06/newtons-temperature-scale.html Thermal expansion As a solid is heated (not melted), it expands Δ𝐿 𝐿 = Δ𝑊 𝑊 = Δ𝐷 𝐷 = 𝛼𝐿Δ𝑇 Length, LWidth, WΔW ΔL Change in temperatureLinear expansion coefficient Area: Δ𝐴 𝐴 = 𝛼𝐴Δ𝑇 = 2𝛼𝐿Δ𝑇 Volume: Δ𝑉 𝑉 = 𝛼𝑉Δ𝑇 = 3𝛼𝐿Δ𝑇 Area expansion coefficient Volume expansion coefficient Thermal expansion Q: An aluminium rod is heated from 20°C to 120°C, and expands to a length of 4 metres. How long was the rod originally? The rod has linear expansion coefficient 𝛼 = 2.3 × 10 −5K-1 Thermal stress If we prevent a rod from expanding under heat (say, by compressing it between two walls), then rod exerts a force on the walls Thermal stress: 𝐹 𝐴 = 𝑌𝛼𝐿Δ𝑇 Force Force Length (fixed) Cross-sectional area, A https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303805601/figure/fig2/AS:36 9544368541698@1465117651748/Thermal-Stress-Induced-Buckle.png https://res.cloudinary.com/engineering- com/image/upload/v1592495002/tips/ThermalBuckling_m5rh26.png Thermal stressLennard Jones meets thermal expansion With asymmetric potential (right), as we increase energy (and hence potential) we find the average value of bond length is unchanged (no thermal expansion) With LJ (left), as energy increases so too does average bond length (thermal expansion) Say we take a metal ring (hole in the middle) and heat it – do we expect the hole in the middle to: a) Get larger? b) Get smaller? c) Stay the same size? If instead we constrain the metal ring within some circular wall – what will happen now? Do we expect the hole in the middle to: a) Get larger? b) Get smaller? c) Stay the same size? Summary Discussed (very briefly) the definition of temperature and various scales used to define it Looked at thermal expansion and stress, both macroscopically (in terms of its physical effects) and microscopically (in terms of the Lennard- Jones potential) Learnt that eating mercury did not necessarily pan out for Newton","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
