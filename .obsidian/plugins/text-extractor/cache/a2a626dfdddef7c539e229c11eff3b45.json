Q1. Which of the following sequences (an) converge? If a sequence converges find its limit. Justify any assertions that you make. (i) an = (1 + 1 n )100 (ii) an = (1 + 1 n + 100 )n (iii) an = ( 2 + 1 n )n (iv) an = (1 + 1 3n − 1 )3n−1 (v) an = ( 1 + 1 n )100n [Recall that the sequence (1 + 1 n )n converges to Euler’s constant e. You may refer to this fact.] 1 2 Q2. A sequence (an) is defined recursively by an+1 = 1 2 (1 + 1 an ) , a1 = 1/2. Observe that (an) is not a monotone sequence. (a) (i) Show that an ≥ 1 2 for all n ∈ N, and deduce further that an ≤ 3 2 for all n ∈ N. [Hint: It is best to avoid induction this time.] (ii) State a theorem that guarantees that (an) has a convergent subse- quence. (b) Let (bn) be the subsequence of (an) given by bn = a2n for each n ∈ N. (i) Prove that bn+1 = 1 2 ( 1 + 2bn bn + 1 ) for all n ∈ N. (ii) Prove further that bn+2 − bn+1 = bn+1 − bn (bn + 1)(bn+1 + 1) for all n ∈ N, and deduce that (bn) is decreasing. (iii) State a theorem that allows you to conclude that (bn) converges and find its limit. (iv) Show further that the subsequence (cn) of (an) given by cn = a2n+1 also converges, and to the same limit as that of (bn). [Hint: write down a formula relating the subsequences (bn) and (cn).] Q3. For each n ∈ N let an = n∑ k=1 1 n + k . (i) Prove that 1 2 ≤ an ≤ 1 for all n. (ii) Prove that (an) is monotone. (iii) Deduce that (an) converges to a limit ℓ ∈ R where 1 2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 1. [You should refer explicitly to any results that you apply from the module.] Q4. (i) Show that the sequence (an) given by an = cos ( n2π 2 ) , does not converge. (ii) For n ∈ N let pn denote the nth prime number, and let an = 1 pn+1 − pn . Show that (an) possesses a convergent subsequence. (iii) Suppose that (an) is a sequence of real numbers, and (ank ) is a subsequence. By appealing to the appropriate definitions, prove that if (an) tends to infinity then so does (ank ). Extra Questions 3 EQ1. Study the proof (from recording 1SAS 1.14 or the lecture notes) of the convergence of the sequence (an), given by an = ( 1 + 1 n )n . (i) Why does this proof break down when applied to the sequence (bn), given by bn = (1 − 1 n )n? (ii) Show that an−1bn = (1 − 1 n ) for all n ≥ 2. What does this allow us to conclude about the sequence (bn)? Justify your assertions. (iii) Consider the sequence (cn), given by cn = (1 + (−1)n n )n . Does this sequence converge? Justify your answer. EQ2. Suppose (an) is a sequence which is not bounded above. (i) Prove that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers (nk) such that ank > k for each k. (ii) Deduce that (an) has a subsequence that tends to infinity. EQ3. Can you find two sequences (an) and (bn), which are not the same sequence, but such that each is a subsequence of the other?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
