Freed Department of Mathematics University of Texas at Austin December 9, 1992 What follows are lecture notes about Topological Quantum Field Theory. While the lectures were aimed at physicists, the content is highly mathematical in its style and motivation. The subject of Topological Quantum Field Theory is young and developing rapidly in many directions. These lectures are not at all representative of this activity, but rather reﬂect particular interests of the author. Our theme is locality and gluing laws. The idea that global quantities can be computed from local formulas is an old one in topology and geometry. So too are formulas which express the change in a global invariant when we change a space locally. One should think of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in homology theory [Sp] as an example. So too the local index theorem [ABP]. In knot theory one has the skein relations [K]. The Casson invariant obeys a surgery formula, and some recent work exploits formulas which calculate the change of Donaldson’s invariant under certain surgeries [GM]. These examples illustrate that the gluing laws are not simply a theoretical nicety, but rather a useful tool for computation. The idea of these lectures, then, is to explore the origin of locality in ﬁeld theory from ﬁrst principles. Since this notion relies on Feynman’s path integral in the quantum theory, we restrict ourselves to a very simple toy model in which the path integral is a ﬁnite sum. Thus we avoid all of the analytical diﬃculties usually encountered in quantum theory. The penalty we pay is that this toy model has little real mathematical or physical interest. The payoﬀ is that it nicely illustrates some of the main ideas, and allows us to explore some more subtle features. There is also locality and gluing laws in classical ﬁeld theory, and in Lecture #4 we discuss a particularly illuminating case. Here is a brief summary of the lectures. In Lecture #1 we give a rough description of the deﬁnition and properties of a lagrangian ﬁeld theory. We state them as “axioms”, though they should not be taken as a rigid mathematical system like Euclidean geometry.

Our intent is only to coerce the reader into formulating familiar theories in terms which will help him or her relate to the more mathematical theories which follow. Lectures #2 and #3 discuss gauge theory with ﬁnite gauge group, our toy model. Lecture #4 is an introduction to the rich geometry of classical Chern-Simons theory. Lecture #5 is a report on some computer computations designed to convince skeptics that it all works! A more complete treatment of the topics in Lectures #2–#5 may be found in several papers of the author listed in the bibliography. That fact alone should dispel any illusion of impartiality or completeness of these lectures! 2 Lecture #1: The Basic Structure of Field Theories Today we begin with a general discussion of basic features of ﬁeld theories, both on the classical and quantum levels. We only focus on the very basic features which interest us in our discussion of a special type of ﬁeld theories: topological ﬁeld theories. Missing is any discussion of local analytic properties, speciﬁcs about the Lorentz metric, etc. Rather, following Segal [S] and Atiyah [A], we list a general set of axioms which ﬁeld theories are meant to satisfy. They resemble the Steenrod axioms for homology theory [Sp] much more closely than the Wightman axioms for ﬁeld theory [GJ]. By no means are they meant to capture all properties of ﬁeld theory, just as one could hardly do intricate calculations in homology theory just knowing the axioms. But they do provide a focus for our discussion, and they emphasize the properties of interest. We present them in the context of general ﬁeld theories, and illustrate them with some non-topological examples. We encourage the reader to think about these axioms in familiar examples of ﬁeld theories (and also mechanical systems, which are the 0 + 1 dimensional case of a ﬁeld theory). There is a much more detailed and precise treatment of these axioms in [Q1]. Fields and the Action We speak of a (d + 1)-dimensional ﬁeld theory: d space dimensions and 1 time dimension. So d = 0, 1, . . . is the dimension of space—it is ﬁxed at the beginning. I will always use ‘X’ to denote a spacetime—some sort of d + 1 dimensional manifold—and ‘Y ’ to denote a space—some sort of d dimensional manifold. By “sort” of manifold we mean manifold with extra structure. This can take the form of topological data, like an orientation or spin structure, or diﬀerential geometric data, like a metric or conformal structure. Usual ﬁeld theories are often done in X = Rd+1 and Y = Rd, or perhaps in some open subsets of these Euclidean spaces. A key feature of topological theories is that X and Y are allowed to be curved manifolds. The spacetimes X are more fundamental than the spaces Y , so I’ll talk now only about spacetimes. In traditional ﬁeld theory one sometimes considers X = Sd+1, a (d + 1)-dimensional sphere, or X = S1 × · · · × S1, a (d + 1)-dimensional torus. These are then thought of as compactiﬁcations of Rd+1. But we want to consider more complicated spaces. We generally restrict to compact spacetimes, both with and without boundary. Deﬁnition. A manifold is called closed if it is compact and has no boundary. This is a diﬀerent use of ‘closed’ from the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ sets of topology. Most ﬁeld theories are deﬁned on manifolds endowed with a metric, traditionally of Lorentz signature. The topological theory we consider in Lectures #2–#5 (Chern-Simons Theory) does not use a metric—in fact, the spacetimes have no continuous parameters. However, our ﬁrst example today, the σ-model, is of the traditional type; it is deﬁned using a metric. We use Riemannian metrics, so do Euclidean ﬁeld theory. σ-model Usually a ﬁeld theory begins with some ﬁxed data, independent of any spacetimes, ﬁelds, etc. 3 Here this is: d = 0, 1, . . . dimension of the theory minus one (M, h) a Riemannian manifold with metric h These data are ﬁxed once and for all. M is not to be confused with the spacetimes, which are (X d+1, g) a compact, oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension d + 1 with metric g. Now to have a ﬁeld theory we need ﬁelds! These are some sort of function on the spacetime, though the function may be vector-valued or even more twisted. For example, in gauge theory the ﬁeld is a connection on the spacetime, though it is not immediately obvious how to think of this as a function on spacetime. In the σ-model the ﬁelds are: CX = Map (X, M ) These are the ﬁelds on the spacetime X. It is useful to think about the assignment X ↦−→ CX which attaches a space of ﬁelds to every spacetime. In this case a ﬁeld is a smooth map φ : X → M . The other key ingredient is the action, which is a function on the space of ﬁelds: (1) SX : CX → R. In the typical case this function has real values, but in later lectures when we consider the Chern- Simons theory this will have to be modiﬁed. The σ-model action is: (2) SX (φ) = ∫ X |dφ| 2 d volX . It might look more familiar if we introduce local coordinates xi on X and yα on M . Then φ looks like yα = yα(x1, . . . , x d+1) and SX (φ) = ∫ X ∂yα ∂xi ∂yβ ∂xj hαβ gij√ det(gij) dx1 . . . dx d+1. We require X compact to avoid convergence problems. Formal Axioms What I want to observe here are formal properties of the ﬁelds and action, properties which carry over to any ﬁeld theory. We will not discuss the σ-model any further; we only introduced the σ-model action here to illustrate the general structure of ﬁeld theories. So these axioms apply to any ﬁeld theory whose spacetimes are compact oriented Riemannian manifolds. They need only slight modiﬁcations, depending on the particular types of spacetimes in the theory, to apply to any ﬁeld theory. 4 Functoriality Axiom. Suppose f : (X ′, g′) → (X, g) is an orientation preserving isometry. Thus f : X ′ → X is a diﬀeomorphism of manifolds which preserves the orientation, and f ∗(g) = g′. We allow the possibility X = X ′ and g = g′; then f is an isometry of (X, g). Think of these as symmetries of spacetimes. Then f induces a map of ﬁelds f ∗ : CX → CX ′ and the action is preserved: SX ′(f ∗φ) = SX (φ), φ ∈ CX . This is the axiom which we need to modify depending on the type of theory. Generally, the map f should be a diﬀeomorphism which preserves whatever extra geometric and topological structures the spacetimes carry. Exercise 1 Check this for the σ-model action (2). In local coordinates it is the change of variable formula for the integral. Exercise 2 If X = R4 with the Minkowski metric, what are the isometries f : X → X? What does the Functoriality Axiom tell us about the action on Minkowski space? Exercise 3 A compact 1-manifold which is connected is diﬀeomorphic to either a circle or a closed interval. Now determine the possible metrics on the manifold up to isometry. (Hint: Construct invariants of the metric which are unchanged by isometry.) Exercise 4 Suppose d = 0. Then the spacetime X is an interval or a circle, and a ﬁeld is a path in M . Interpret the action (2). Is the length of the path a possible action? Orientation Axiom. If −X denotes X with the opposite orientation, then C−X = CX and (3) S−X (φ) = −SX (φ), φ ∈ CX . This is ultimately an expression of the unitarity of the theory, and may not hold in nonunitary theories. In the simple theory we discuss in Lecture #2 the spacetimes do not even carry an orientation. The next axiom explains how to express the ﬁelds and the action for nonconnected spacetimes in terms of the ﬁelds and action for connected spacetimes. 5 Additivity Axiom. Suppose X1, X2 are spacetimes and X = X1 ⊔ X2 the disjoint union. Then CX ∼= CX1 × CX2 . Let φ1 ∈ CX1, φ2 ∈ CX2 and φ = φ1 ⊔ φ2 ∈ CX . Then (4) SX (φ) = SX1(φ1) + SX2(φ2). Exercise 5 Verify (3) and (4) for the σ-model. The ﬁnal axiom is a generalization of the Additivity Axiom, and is the central idea of these lectures. I call it the Gluing Axiom—it expresses the idea that the action and the ﬁelds are local. Gluing Axiom. Let X be a spacetime and Y ֒→ X an oriented codimension one submanifold. Cut along Y to obtain a new spacetime X cut (see Figure 1 ). Then there is an “equalizer diagram” (5) CX → CX cut ⇉ CY . If φ ∈ CX with φcut ∈ CX cut the corresponding ﬁeld on X cut, then (6) SX (φ) = SX cut(φcut). Figure 1: Cutting a manifold along a codimension one submanifold What does (5) mean? It means that a ﬁeld on X is a ﬁeld on X cut which has the same boundary values on the two components of ∂X cut corresponding to Y . (Incidentally, this is very similar to the deﬁning property of a sheaf .) What (6) means is that the action on X can just as well be compared on X cut. To simplify notation we will often picture cutting and pasting as in Figure 2, where we cut a closed manifold into two pieces. Then what the preceding means in that ﬁgure is that if we 6 Figure 2: Cutting a closed manifold into two pieces have ﬁelds φL ∈ CXL and φR ∈ CXR which agree on Y , then there is a ﬁeld φ ∈ CX which agrees with these on each piece, and the action is (7) SX (φ) = SXL(φL) + SXR(φR). We will see these pictures many times throughout these lectures. Exercise 6 Derive (7) from (6). You will need to use the Additivity Axiom as well. Exercise 7 Verify the Gluing Law for the σ-model action. Check the special case of d = 0. The four axioms are characteristic properties of the classical action of a ﬁeld theory. We do not mean the above to be a rigorous statement of the axioms—we will have to modify them anyway in the Chern-Simons Theory. Nor do we wish to develop the subject axiomatically. Rather, we wish to isolate and emphasize these properties. Topological Actions A topological ﬁeld theory is deﬁned on spacetimes with no continuous parameters, i.e., no dif- ferential geometric data like a (background) metric. The spacetimes may carry discrete topological data like an orientation or spin structure. Of course, the ﬁelds may still have continuous parameters. We give a typical example of the form of a topological action. This is a simple variant of the topological actions which arise in practice. The ﬁxed data for this theory is: d = 0, 1, . . . dimension of the theory minus one M a smooth manifold ω ∈ Ωd+1 M a (d + 1)-form on M Again, M is not to be confused with the spacetimes, which we now list together with the ﬁelds and the action. Spacetimes: X a compact oriented (d + 1)-manifold. Fields: CX = Map(X, M ) 7 Action: If φ : X → M then the action is (8) SX (φ) = ∫ X φ∗ω. So this theory is a sort of topological version of the σ-model in M , though it is not what is usually referred to as the Topological Sigma Model [W2]. Exercise 8 Verify the axioms stated above for this action. What is the proper statement of the Functoriality Axiom? Exercise 9 a) Suppose that ω is closed , i.e., dω = 0. Show that if ∂X = 0 (X is closed), then SX (φ) only depends on the homotopy class of φ. b) If X is not closed, then SX (φ) varies as φ moves through a homotopy. Nonetheless, we can reinterpret the action as an invariant of the homotopy class. Try to do this by explaining the dependence of the action on φ. (Hint: The action only depends on the boundary values of φ.) The Chern-Simons action may be considered as a variant of (8), but the symbols ‘ω’ and ‘ ∫ ’ have to be radically reinterpreted. Quantum Theory The path integral quantization requires a measure µX on CX which satisﬁes certain properties which we do not specify here. Then for X closed we deﬁne the partition function as the path integral (9) ZX = ∫ CX e iSX (φ) dµX (φ). Note that ZX is a complex number. The big mathematical problem is that in many examples of interest µX has not been rigorously deﬁned. This has been a big subject of investigation. Also, in Euclidean ﬁeld theory the ‘i’ is replaced by ‘−1’ and we integrate e −SX (φ) instead of e iSX (φ). You can add a parameter ℏ if you like. Here my concern is only the formal properties, which for now do not include the properties as ℏ → 0. We return to that perturbation theory in Lecture #5 for the Chern-Simons theory. Here we only consider formal properties of the exact path integral. If ∂X ̸= φ then ZX is a function of a ﬁeld on the boundary ∂X. So if ψ ∈ C∂X let CX (ψ) = {φ ∈ CX : ∂φ = ψ}, That is, CX (ψ) consists of ﬁelds on X whose boundary value is ψ. Then (10) ZX (ψ) = ∫ CX (ψ) e iSX (φ) dµX (φ). 8 The function ZX belongs to a vector space E(∂X) of “certain” functions on C∂X —this is the quantum Hilbert space. The construction of E(∂X) is the subject of canonical quantization. We discuss it in the Chern-Simons theory in Lecture #4, where we will explain a little about what ‘certain’ means above. As an example, consider the (Euclidean) σ-model for d = 0. The classical action in this theory is the energy of a path on a Riemannian manifold M . The quantum ﬁeld theory is the usual quantum mechanics on M . A “space” in this theory, which might occur as (part of) the boundary of a spacetime, is simply a point. The quantum Hilbert space is (11) E(pt) = F(M ) the space of functions on M . Think of smooth functions; here I won’t bother with technicalities about exactly what functions on M we ought to consider. A spacetime which is connected is either a closed interval or a circle, endowed with a metric. For the interval Xt = [0, t] we obtain ZXt (x, y) = pt(x, y) depending on points x, y ∈ M , which comprise the ﬁxed ﬁeld on the boundary ∂([0, t]) = {t} ∪ −{0}. (The minus sign is for the orientation.) This pt for the Euclidean theory is the heat kernel of M , the probability density which measures the amount of heat which ﬂows from x to y in time t. If H : F(M ) → F(M ) is the Laplace operator we can write this heat operator as (12) Z[0,t] = e −tH : F(M ) → F(M ) The fundamental property of gluing is illustrated by: Figure 3: e −(t1+t2)H = e −t1H e −t2H Another case of gluing is the following: Figure 4: ZS1(t) = Tr e −tH That is, the partition function for the circle is the trace of the heat kernel, depending on the length t of the circle. 9 Axioms for Quantum Theory The properties of the quantum Hilbert spaces E(Y ) associated to any space Y (d-manifold + extra structure) and the generalized partition functions (path integrals) ZX associated to a spacetime X ((d + 1)-manifold + extra structure) mirror those mentioned above for the classical action. Indeed, they can be made to formally follow from them if one assumes the existence of a measure on the space of ﬁelds with appropriate properties. These axioms were stated by Segal [S] for conformal ﬁeld theory and Atiyah [A] for topological theories. But they are quite general—the only diﬀerence between diﬀerent types of theories is the structure of the manifold and so the symmetries in the Functoriality Axiom. ¡Repetimos! A ﬁeld theory is formulated on spacetimes X d+1 and spaces Y d with certain extra structure (orientation, metric, ...) depending on the type of theory. There may also be some ﬁxed data. Our spacetimes and spaces are compact. The basic objects in the quantum theory are the quantum Hilbert space and the path integral. Quantum Hilbert Space: Y ↦−→ E(Y ) (∂Y = φ) Path Integral: X ↦−→ ZX ∈ E(∂X) The path integral over a closed manifold is also called the partition function. The term ‘correlation function’ is often used when the boundary is nontrivial, though we tend to (mis)use the term ‘partition function’ instead. The Hilbert spaces and path integrals satisfy properties analogous to those of the classical theory. Functoriality Axiom. If f : Y ′ → Y is a diﬀeomorphism preserving the extra structure (orienta- tion, metric, ...) then there is an induced map f∗ : E(Y ′) → E(Y ). If f : X ′ → X is a diﬀeomorphism preserving the extra structure with induced boundary map ∂f : ∂X ′ → ∂X then (∂f )∗(ZX ′) = ZX . This says that symmetries of the spaces are implemented on the Hilbert spaces, and that symmetries of the spacetimes preserve the path integrals. In many quantum ﬁeld theories, including the Chern- Simons theory, this is not correct as it stands—the symmetries only act projectively. This means that the composition of symmetries acts as the composition of the individual actions up to an overall phase. In other terms, it means that a central extension of the symmetries acts on the Hilbert spaces. Often this is used to disqualify a quantum ﬁeld theory as unrealistic. The study of these central extensions and projective factors goes under the name anomalies, and has been the subject of much mathematical investigation and understanding. 10 Orientation Axiom. E(−Y ) ∼= E(Y ) (conjugate Hilbert space)(13) Z−X = ZX . Multiplicativity Axiom. E(Y1 ⊔ Y2) ∼= E(Y1) ⊗ E(Y2) (tensor product)(14) ZX1⊔X2 = ZX1 ⊗ ZX2(15) The multiplicativity axiom expresses the behavior of the quantum Hilbert spaces and path integrals under disjoint union of spaces and spacetimes. The ﬁnal, and for us the most important axiom, is a generalization of (15) which tells how the path integral behaves when we glue manifolds along an oriented closed codimension one submanifold, as depicted in Figure 5. Figure 5: Cutting a manifold along a codimension one submanifold Gluing Law. Suppose Y ֒→ X is a closed oriented codimension one submanifold, and X cut the spacetime obtained by cutting along Y . Then we have the path integrals ZX ∈ E(∂X) and ZX cut ∈ E(∂X cut) = E(∂X ⊔ Y ⊔ −Y ) ∼= E(∂X) ⊗ E(Y ) ⊗ E(−Y ). Now there is a trace TrY : E(∂X cut) ∼= E(∂X) ⊗ E(Y ) ⊗ E(Y ) −→ E(∂X). \\ / contract using inner product The axiom asserts that the path integrals satisfy (16) ZX = TrY ZX cut 11 Exercise 10 Show that quantum mechanics (11) and (12) satisﬁes these axioms. Exercise 11 Think of other (relativistic) ﬁeld theories in higher dimensions and try to see what properties of these the axioms capture. Exercise 12 a) What does the gluing axiom say about Z[0,t] in a topological 0 + 1 dimensional theory? b) More generally, compute Z[0,1]×Y d in a d + 1 dimensional topological theory. c) Also, compute ZS1×Y d in a d + 1 dimensional topological theory. 12 Lecture #2: Gauge Theory with a Finite Gauge Group Let G be a ﬁnite group. For example, G could be the cyclic group Z/nZ of n elements, or the symmetric group Sn of n! elements. There is no restriction on G. We construct, in arbitrary dimensions, a gauge theory with structure group G. It is surely the simplest quantum ﬁeld theory there is, and is an excellent toy model to illustrate certain features. It exhibits the algebraic and geometric structure we are interested in, but has no analytic diﬃculties whatsoever: all integrals in the theory are ﬁnite sums. It also illustrates some basic properties of gauge theory, especially the role of symmetries and reducible connections. This lecture is based on joint work with Frank Quinn [FQ]. The theory discussed here ﬁrst appeared in a paper of Dijkgraaf and Witten [DW]. There is related unpublished work by Segal, Kontsevich, and Bernstein/Kazhdan. More recent work [F5] examines ﬁner algebraic structures in this theory, in particular the connection to quantum groups, which is a topic of many other lectures at this Summer School. Fields Let X be a spacetime. For this theory we only need a “bare” (d + 1)-manifold, assumed compact. No orientation, metric, etc. is needed. The space of ﬁelds is (17) CX =    P ↓ X : P is a principal (Galois, regular ) covering space with structure group G.    In other terms, P is a principal bundle with structure group G. Thus G acts freely on P and the quotient is P/G = X. We always take G to act on the right. As an example, consider G = Z/3Z. If X = pt then picture is ... P ↓ · X with G cyclically permuting the 3 points. If X = S1 then there are 3 possibilities, up to isomorphism, as illustrated in Figure 6. The nontrivial coverings are pictured as pieces of helices, but the endpoints are meant to be identiﬁed. Topologically, the total space P in these covers is a circle. 13 Figure 6: Triple Coverings of S1 As opposed to the σ-model, where we have a nice space of ﬁelds, the ﬁelds in (17) do not technically form a topological space or even a set. (The collection of all of anything is not a set.) But there is a notion of isomorphic ﬁelds, and the ﬁelds in our theory fall into a ﬁnite number of isomorphism classes. Deﬁnition. An isomorphism ϕ from P ′ to P is a map ϕ : P ′ → P which commutes with the G action and such that the induced map on the quotient X is the identity. This means that for p′ ∈ P ′ and g ∈ G we have ϕ(p′ · g) = ϕ(p′) · g, where the ﬁrst ‘·’ indicates the G action on P ′ and the second ‘·’ the G action on P . Any such map induces a map ϕ : X → X, and we restrict our isomorphism to have ϕ = id. More generally, we can consider diagrams P ′ ϕ → P ↓ ↓ X ′ ¯ϕ → X They enter when we consider symmetries of the spacetimes as well as symmetries of the ﬁelds. So we get a picture of CX which we schematically render in Figure 7. Each point is a ﬁeld and each arrow is a symmetry of ﬁelds, that is, an isomorphism. We can compose two arrows if the second one starts where the ﬁrst one ends. Notice that every object has an identity automorphism. (An automorphism is an isomorphism which starts and ends at the same place). Also, every arrow has an inverse. The arrows which start and end at an object P form a group called Aut P , the automorphism group of P . There is a ﬁnite number of arrows from any point to any other. Aut P is also called the group of gauge transformations of P . 14 Figure 7: Conﬁguration space for gauge theory with ﬁnite gauge group We remark that this picture applies to the space of (gauge) ﬁelds in any gauge theory, except that there are now continuous parameters. The technical word for this structure is a groupoid . See [F1,§1] for a discussion. The ﬁelds P and P ′ are equivalent (P ∼= P ′) or isomorphic if there is an arrow between them. Let CX = set of equivalence classes of ﬁelds on X. What makes gauge theories with ﬁnite gauge group so simple is that CX is a ﬁnite set if X is compact. Exercise 13 Determine CX for X = pt. For X = S1. Exercise 14 Show that CX satisﬁes the formal axioms listed in Lecture #1. Does CX satisfy these axioms? (Notice that there is no orientation axiom in this theory.) Exercise 15 Show that CX is a ﬁnite set for any compact manifold X. Suppose X is connected. Fix a basepoint x ∈ X and p ∈ Px, where Px is the ﬁber of P at x. Then a ﬁeld P → X determines a map loops at x → G by taking the holonomy around the loop using the basepoint p. (See Figure 8.) Any loop at x lifts uniquely to a path in P which starts at p and ends at some p′ in the ﬁber Px of P over x. The 15 p\u0000 p x\u0000 Figure 8: Deﬁnition of holonomy holonomy h ∈ G is the unique h satisfying p′ = p · h. The holonomy only depends on the homotopy class of the loop. Exercise 16 a) Check this last assertion. b) Show that the map π1(X, x) → G deﬁned by holonomy is a homomorphism of groups. c) If γ is this homomorphism, and we change the basepoint p and/or x, then the new homomorphism is gγg−1 for g ∈ G. Exercise 16 holds more generally for any ﬂat connection with arbitrary gauge group. The above exercise shows that there is an isomorphism (of sets) (18) CX ∼= Hom(π1(x), G)/G if X is connected. (We omit the irrelevant basepoint.) In Exercise 14 it is important to observe that the ﬁelds CX are local, i.e., they can be cut and glued. 16 Action After so much work just to deﬁne ﬁelds, we can relax—we deﬁne the action to be identically zero! SX (P ) = 0 for all P ∈ CX . There are other possibilities, but this requires using the cohomology of the classifying space of the group, or equivalently group cohomology. These “twisted theories” are in essence constructed through a modiﬁcation of (8) and the exercises which follow. See [FQ], [Q1], [Q2] for details. So the classical action in our toy theory is completely trivial! It’s surprising that we can learn anything from such an action. The fact that we will demonstrates the rich structure already present in the symmetries of the ﬁelds. Now on to the quantization. Measure Since CX is discrete, a measure is just an assignment of a mass to each ﬁeld P . The appropriate choice is (19) µX (P ) = 1 # Aut P . The ‘#’ sign counts the number of elements in a set. Notice that if P ∼= P ′ then Aut P ∼= Aut P ′. So µ passes to a measure on the quotient CX . Figure 9: Gluing bundles 17 We did not state axioms for the measure in Lecture #1. But we do need to know how the measure behaves under gluing. Fix a bundle Q → Y . We consider the gluing map (20) gQ : CX cut (Q ⊔ Q) → CX (Q) from (equivalence classes of) bundles over X cut whose restriction to each copy of Y is Q to (equiva- lence classes of) bundles over X. (This needs to be made precise in a careful way.) The key formula is that for any [P ] ∈ CX whose restriction to Y is isomorphic to Q, (21) µX ([P ]) = vol ( g−1 Q ([P ])) · µX (Q) We use [P ] to denote the equivalent classes of bundles containing P . As an illustration consider gluing the two ends of an interval together to obtain a circle. Then Q is the trivial bundle ... Q ↓ · pt Now the equivalence classes of bundles over an interval are in 1 : 1 correspondence with the elements of G, since we are meant to have isomorphisms of the restriction to each endpoint with the trivial bundle, so can identify the holonomy, as in Figure 10. Finally, the equivalence classes of bundles over the circle are in 1 : 1 correspondence with the conjugacy classes in G. This happens since when we glue the two ends of the interval together we are supposed to forget the basepoint and the trivialization, so we can only determine the holonomy up to conjugacy. Therefore, for this particular gluing (20) specializes to the map g : G → Conj(G) which assigns to each h ∈ G its conjugacy class [h]. Then (21) reduces to a standard formula in group theory: (22) #[h] · #Ch = #G. Here Ch is the centralizer of h, i.e., the subgroup of elements of G which commute with h, and h is an arbitrary element in the conjugacy class [h]. Figure 10: Bundle with basepoints over the interval 18 Quantization Given the ﬁelds, the action, and the measure we can carry out the quantization using (9) and (10). Keep in mind that the set of equivalence classes of bundles is ﬁnite, so we are dealing with ﬁnite measure spaces. In other words, the “path integral” in this case is a ﬁnite sum. Also, note that since there are symmetries on the ﬁelds, we carry out the path integral on the equivalence classes of ﬁelds. Note too that the space of equivalence classes is not the quotient of a set by a group action. Rather, the picture looks like Figure 7. That said, the quantum Hilbert space is E(Y ) = L 2(CY , µY ) and the path integral on a closed manifold is (23) ZX = ∫ CX e iSX ([P ]) dµX ([P ]) = vol(CX ). If X has boundary, then for each Q ∈ C∂X we let CX (Q) be the set of bundles over X whose restriction to ∂X is Q, up to isomorphisms which are the identity on ∂X. If X has no closed components, then elements of CX (Q) have no automorphisms. Deﬁne (24) ZX (Q) = ∫ CX (Q) e iSX ([P ]) dµX ([P ]) = vol ( CX (Q)) . This is the standard procedure: we integrate over ﬁelds which satisfy a boundary condition. It is easy to check that for equivalent ﬁelds Q ∼= Q ′ on Y , we have ZX (Q) = ZX (Q ′). So ZX is a function on the set of equivalence classes of ﬁelds, that is, it is an element of E(∂X). Theorem. Equations (22)–(24) deﬁne a topological quantum ﬁeld theory. That is, these deﬁnitions satisfy the axioms stated in Lecture #1. Figure 11: A simple gluing 19 We don’t write a complete proof, but do illustrate the gluing law in case ∂X = ∅ (Figure 11). (As usual, this simpliﬁcation is only for ease of notation.) Let {Q} be a set of representations of CY . Recall the gluing map (20). Then ZX = vol(CX ) = ∑ Q∈{Q} ∫ CX (Q) dµX ([P ]) = ∑ Q∈{Q} {∫ CXcut (Q⊔Q) dµX cut ([P cut]) } · µY (Q) by (21)) = ∑ Q∈{Q} ZX cut(Q ⊔ Q)µY (Q) = TrY ZX cut . Exercise 17 Carefully verify the theorem above. Consequence of the Axioms We note a few elementary properties of topological quantum ﬁeld theories in general. First, let I be a closed interval (it doesn’t matter which—they are all diﬀeomorphic) and Y a space (d- manifold). Consider the product spacetime I × Y . It is a spacetime which is globally a product of time and space. (We write time ﬁrst for reasons of orientation.) Its boundary is −Y ⊔ Y . So using the orientation and multiplicativity axioms (13) and (14) we identify ZI×Y as a map ZI×Y : E(Y ) → E(Y ) Now the gluing law applied to Figure 12: Gluing cylinders implies (25) (ZI×Y )2 = ZI×Y . We may as well assume a nondegeneracy condition: (26) ZI×Y = id . 20 In general, (25) only implies that ZI×Y is a projection operator on E(Y ). But only the states in the image ever appear in the theory, so it is hardly a loss of generality to deal with theories which are nondegenerate in the sense that (26) holds. Similarly, the gluing law applied to Figure 13: Gluing the ends of a cylinder shows that (27) ZS1×Y = dim E(Y ) in a nondegenerate theory. Exercise 18 a) One of the axioms states that a diﬀeomorphism f : Y ′ → Y induces a linear map f∗ : E(Y ′) → E(Y ). Show that (in a nondegenerate theory) if f0 is homotopic to f1, then (f0)∗ = (f1)∗. b) Suppose that we have a 2 + 1 dimensional theory. Show that E(S1 × S1) carries a representation of SL2(Z), the group of 2 × 2 matrices with integer entries and positive determinant which are invertible and whose inverse also has integer entries. (If there are no orientations the appropriate group is GL2(Z).) 0 + 1 Dimensional Theory There is not much to say here. The basic vector space is E(pt) and if the theory is nondegenerate, then by (26) ZI = identity : E(pt) → E(pt). By (27), ZS1 = dim E(pt). In the theory constructed from a ﬁnite group Cpt has one element, the equivalence class of the trivial bundle. So E(pt) is a 1 dimensional vector space. Now CS1 is in 1 : 1 correspondence with the conjugacy classes, so (27) implies ∑ conjugacy classes [h] 1 #Ch = 1. In fact, this is true and is equivalent to (22). 21 1 + 1 Dimensional Theory We ﬁrst discuss 1 + 1 dimensional topological theories in general. Our discussion is not meant to be precise, but in a given example one can usually make it so. This material is well-known. There is a basic vector space in the theory E = E(S1). The disk D2 gives an element in this vector space ZD2 ∈ E. Recall that E is also assumed to be endowed with an inner product. This really is related to the orientation, but we will ignore that here. Also, for simplicity we ignore the conjugation here and treat E as a real vector space. The other crucial ingredient is the path integral over the “pair of pants” pictured in Figure 14. Figure 14: Pair of pants We identify this path integral (using the inner product to identify E ∼= E∗) as a map m : E ⊗ E → E. Proposition. The map m is a multiplication which makes E a commutative, associative algebra with identity element ZD2. Furthermore, m is compatible with the inner product in the sense that a ⊗ b ⊗ c ↦−→ ( m(a, b), c) , a, b, c ∈ E, is totally symmetric in a, b, c. This is easy to see with pictures, and is proved using the Functoriality Axiom and the gluing law. For example, to see that ZD2 is the identity map, glue the disk to the pair of pants to obtain a cylinder: 22 Figure 15: Multiplication by the identity element By (26) the path integral over the cylinder is the identity map. Associativity is the equivalence of the two diagrams Figure 16: Associativity law after gluing. The other assertions follow from the self-diﬀeomorphisms of the pair of pants (Fig- ure 14) which permute the boundary components. Exercise 19 Prove carefully the assertions in the proposition. In addition, using the inner product one can show that E is a semisimple algebra. This means that there is an isomorphism E ∼= C × · · · C to a product of copies of C. In other words, there exist elements di ∈ E, i = 1, . . . , dim E such that (28) didj = { 0 i ̸= j ; dj i = j. These elements are unique up to order. Exercise 20 a) Express the identity element of E in terms of di. b) Show that the dj are orthogonal. 23 Up to isomorphism the algebra E and inner product are determined by the numbers λ2 i = (di, di) = |di| 2. Furthermore, the partition function of a surface Σg of genus g ...\u0000 Figure 17: Surface of genus g is computable in terms of the λ2 i as (29) ZΣg = ∑ i (λ2 i )1−g. Exercise 21 Prove formula (29). In the context of “conformal blocks”, which we will meet in the next lecture, (29) is called the Verlinde formula. Here it is presented abstractly for 1 + 1 dimensional topological ﬁeld theories. We apply this general discussion to the 1 + 1 dimensional gauge theory with ﬁnite gauge group G. Since CS1 is in 1 : 1 correspondence with the conjugacy classes in G, we identify E(S1) ∼= {central functions on G} ∼= {functions f : G → C invariant under conjugation} Some computation shows that the inner product is (30) (f1, f2) = 1 #G ∑ g∈G f1(g)f2(g). Exercise 22 Derive (30) from the measure (19) and the deﬁnition (22). Finally, we can do the path integral (24) over the pair of pants (Figure 14) to determine the multiplication. It turns out to be the convolution (31) (f1 ∗ f2)(g) = ∑ g1g2=g f1(g1)f2(g2). 24 Exercise 23 Derive (31). Now we can apply the Schur orthogonality relations of ﬁnite group theory to determine the special elements di in (28). They are di = dim Vi #G · χi, where V1, . . . , Vs are the irreducible representations of G and χi is the character of Vi. From (29) we conclude (32) ZΣg = ∑ i ( dim Vi #G )2−2g . A cute formula As a simple application of the ideas in this lecture, and as a further illustration of the gluing law, we use (32) to derive a nice formula which counts the representations of surface groups in ﬁnite groups. Although it may hold some intrinsic interest, we present it here as a toy illustration of how the ideas in topological quantum ﬁeld theory, particularly the gluing law, can be used to derive a result in a ﬁeld external to quantum ﬁeld theory. To begin, recall from (23) that ZΣg = vol(CΣg ). Let Γg = π1Σg be the surface group. Then from (18) and (19) we have ZΣg = ∑ [γ]∈Hom(Γg,G)/G 1 #Cγ where γ : Γg → G is a homomorphism, [γ] its conjugacy class in Hom(∇g, G)/G, and Cγ ⊂ G the stabilizer of γ in Hom(Γg, G) under the conjugation action of G. So (33) ZΣg = ∑ [γ]∈Hom(Γg,G)/G 1 #Cγ = ∑ γ∈Hom(Γg ,G) 1 #[γ] 1 #Cγ = 1 #G # Hom(Γg, G). Combining (33) and (32) we ﬁnd our desired “cute formula”: (34) # Hom(Γg, G) = (#G)2g−1 ∑ i (dim Vi)2−2g. Recall that V1, . . . , Vs is a representative list of irreducible representations of G. Equation (34) can be proved using standard group theoretical methods, though it is not obvious. Here we have derived it using the gluing laws of quantum ﬁeld theory. Exercise 24 Check (34) for abelian groups G. Exercise 25 Check (34) for g = 0 and g = 1. 25 Lecture #3: 2 + 1 dimensional theories with finite gauge group The structure of 2 + 1 dimensional theories has been investigated by Reshetikhin/Turaev, Kont- sevich, Walker, Alvarez-Gaume, Sierra, Gomez, and many more—I am not sure of exact references. One gets the impression from these investigations that eventually there is an equivalence    2 + 1 dimensional TQFT with stronger gluing laws than stated in these lectures    ←→    “braided monoidal categories” of a certain type, or some sort of quantum group data    (Geometry) (Algebra) Much attention has been devoted to constructing the geometry from the algebra. For example, the work of Reshetikhin/Turaev [RT], Walker [Wa] give precise theorems about this. Here we discuss the reverse, showing how some algebraic structures emerge out of the gluing laws of the TQFT. Rather than work in some abstract axiomatic setting, we consider the gauge theory with ﬁnite structure group G that we discussed in Lecture #2. The algebraic structures we encounter are closely related to the symmetries of the ﬁelds. For the material in this lecture I refer to my paper [FQ] with Quinn. I also refer to Quinn’s lectures [Q1], which go into more detail about the algebraic structures which arise. My recent work [F5] derives the algebraic structure (including the modular tensor categories and quantum groups) directly from the classical action. Surfaces with boundary. In the 2 + 1 dimensional theory the “spaces” are 2 dimensional. The new point is to consider cutting and pasting (gluing) of surfaces, that is, to extend the theory to surfaces with boundary. Recall that for closed surfaces Y we constructed a quantum Hilbert space E(Y ) in (22). Our goal is to extend this construction to compact surfaces with boundary, and then to derive a gluing law for this extension. For a closed surface Y the quantum Hilbert space E(Y ) consists of functions on CY , the set of equivalence classes of bundles over Y . If we want to allow surfaces with boundary, deﬁne quantum Hilbert spaces attached to these surfaces, and glue such surfaces along boundary components, then this gluing must induce a gluing on equivalence classes of bundles. On the other hand, gluing is not well-deﬁned on equivalence classes of bundles. Example (in lower dimensions): Up to isomorphism there is only one bundle over the interval I—the trivial bundle. But if we glue the two ends of I to form a circle S1, then there are many possible bundles over S1 obtained by gluing the trivial bundle. To make gluing well-deﬁned on equivalence classes we introduce basepoints. Thus a surface Y with boundary is meant to have a basepoint y on each component of ∂Y as in Figure 18. Then we deﬁne C′ Y = {⟨Q; q1, . . . , qk⟩ : Q → Y is a principal G bundle and qi ∈ Qyi . } 26 Figure 18: Surface with basepoints Here Qyi is the ﬁber of Q over the basepoint yi. Example (in lower dimensions): A bundle over I with basepoints looks like Figure 19: A principal G bundle over the interval with basepoints Now there is no ambiguity about the gluing—we identify q1 and q2 when we glue. If q2 = q1 · h for h ∈ G, then the holonomy of the glued bundle is the conjugacy class of h. There is again a notion of isomorphism for elements of C′ Y —now bundle maps are required to preserve the basepoints. The set of equivalence classes (still ﬁnite) is denoted C′ Y . As we did in the example above, we can deﬁne C′ Y for all compact manifolds Y , not just for surfaces. Exercise 26 a) Determine C′ I for an interval I. b) Determine C′ D2 for the disk. c) Determine C′ I×S1 for the cylinder. d) Determine C′ Y for the pair of points Y . e) Determine C′ Y for the surface Y = Σg − disk. 27 Figure 20: Elementary surfaces with basepoints Exercise 27 Suppose S is a connected manifold with basepoint s ∈ S. Let R → S and R′ → S′ be isomorphic G bundles with basepoints r ∈ RS, r′ ∈ R′ S in the ﬁbers over s. Prove that there is a unique isomorphism R′ → R which maps r′ to r. This last exercise implies that elements of C′ Y do not have nontrivial automorphisms. In other words, the picture of C′ Y is Figure 21: The conﬁguration space for bundles with basepoints There is a unique arrow in each direction between isomorphic bundles. This is why gluing is well- deﬁned on the quotient. Now a bundle over S1 with basepoint has a deﬁnite holonomy h ∈ G. (Recall that without the basepoint the holonomy is determined only up to conjugacy.) So in Figure 22, if Q1 ∈ C′ Y1 and Q2 ∈ C′ Y2, then we can glue Q1 to Q2 along S if the holonomies agree, and this gluing is well-deﬁned on equivalence classes. Denote the glued bundle by Q1 ◦Q2. Note we can glue along any components of a surface with boundary—for example, as pictured in Figure 23. As usual, we use the picture in Figure 22 only to simplify the notation. So the gluing operation is well deﬁned as a map BY1,Y2 ⊂ C′ Y1 × C′ Y2 ցg C′ Y 28 Figure 22: Gluing surfaces and bundles with basepoints Figure 23: Another gluing of pointed surfaces where BY1,Y2 is the set of pairs ⟨Q1, Q2⟩ (with basepoints) whose holonomies agree along S, and BY1,Y2 is the set of equivalence classes of such pairs of bundles. The cylinder Figure 24: Pointed bundle over the cylinder Consider the cylinder I × S1. If Q → I × S1 is a bundle with basepoints, then we can determine group elements g, x ∈ G where g is the parallel transport from one end to the other, and x is the 29 holonomy around the left end. The holonomy around the right end is gxg−1 (Figure 24). Now consider the gluing Figure 25: Gluing pointed cylinders If we have bundles Q1, Q2 over the cylinders on the left, we can glue if the holonomies in middle agree. So if Qi is given by group elements ⟨xi, gi⟩, then we can glue if and only if x2 = g1x1g−1 1 . We picture the bundle ⟨x, g⟩ as an arrow Figure 26: Schematic representation of a pointed bundle over the pointed cylinder So the set of (#G)2 equivalence classes of bundles over I × S1 (always with basepoints) is the set of arrows in the picture: Figure 27: Equivalence classes of pointed bundles over the cylinder (This is a picture for the symmetric group S3, in fact.) Note that at the identity e sits a copy of G, and more generally the set of arrows from x to x is the centralizer subgroup Cx ⊂ G. This is the subgroup of elements of G which commute with x. The set of all arrows is a groupoid . Exercise 28 Draw this picture for an abelian group G. 30 Quantization The measure we use on C′ Y for any Y is still (19), but now understood with basepoints. If Y has no closed components, then there are no nontrivial automorphisms, and the measure is identically 1. The generalization of (22) is E(Y ) = L 2(C′ Y , µY ) for any compact surface Y (with basepoints). Let’s ﬁrst consider the cylinder. We’ve already seen that C′ I×S is a groupoid. This diﬀers from a group in that composition is not always possible. Now, the multiplication m : H × H −→ H on an arbitrary group H determines by duality a coalgebra structure ∆ : F(H) −→ F(H × H) ∼= F(H) ⊗ F(H) on the vector space of functions F(H) on the group. (The last isomorphism needs to be thought about if H is not a ﬁnite group.) The same holds for our groupoid of ﬁelds on the cylinder. Proposition. Let A = E(I × S1). Then A is a coalgebra. That is, there is a comultiplication ∆ : A → A ⊗ A and a counit ε : A → C There is also a “compatible” inner product, the L 2 inner product. We give the formulas, writing an equivalence class of bundles on I × S1 as a pair of group elements ⟨g, x⟩. Suppose a ∈ A. So a : C′ I×S1 → C. An element of A ⊗ A is a function on C′ I×S1 × C′ I×S1. The coproduct is ∆a( ⟨x1, g1⟩, ⟨x2, g2⟩) = { a(⟨x1, g2g1⟩ if x2 = g1x1g−1 1 ; 0, if x2 ̸= g1x1g−1 1 . ε(a) = ∑ x a( ⟨x, e⟩) Gluing Laws Figure 28: Gluing a pointed cylinder onto a pointed surface 31 Now consider an arbitrary compact surface Y . By gluing a cylinder onto the boundary (Figure 28) we obtain an “action” of the groupoid C′ I×S1 on C′ Y . In the quantum picture this translates to Proposition. E(Y ) is a unitary comodule for the coalgebra A. A comodule is a corepresentation, dual to a representation of an algebra. Finally, the gluing law states that in the picture Figure 29: Gluing pointed surfaces we have E(Y ) ∼= 1 #G E(Y1) ⊠A E(Y2). Here ‘⊠A’ is the cotensor product, which is dual to the tensor product of modules of algebras. The factor 1/#G is for the inner product. Conformal Blocks This picture can be made more concrete, and so related to standard notions in conformal ﬁeld theory. Brieﬂy, the coalgebra A is semisimple, so there is a ﬁnite number of irreducible corepresen- tations up to isomorphism, say E1, . . . , EN . Thus for any compact surface Y we can decompose the comodule (corepresentation) E(Y ) into irreducibles: E(Y ) ∼= ⊕ λ E(Y, λ) ⊗ Eλ where now the E(Y, λ) are vector spaces. The λ which label the irreducible representations are called the labels, and we think of assigning the vector space E(Y, λ) to the surface Y with boundary labeled by λ. This is called a conformal block in the physics literature; Graeme Segal [S] uses the term modular functor . Whatever the language, the gluing law takes the form (35) E(Y ) ∼= ⊕ λ dim Eλ #G · E(Y1, λ) ⊗ E(Y2, λ). The factor refers to the inner product structure; it multiplies the inner product on the Hilbert space which follows. 32 Exercise 29 Show that the deﬁnitions ̃E(S1) = E(S1 × S1) ̃ZY = dim E(Y ) deﬁne a 1 + 1 dimensional TQFT. The associated algebra is called the Verlinde algebra. Exercise 30 By the axioms of TQFT, speciﬁcally the Functoriality Axiom, the symmetries of S1 × S1 act on E(S1 × S1). This gives a representation of SL2(Z) on E(S1 × S1). Compute this representation. Exercise 31 Show that the factor in (35) is S1 λ, where S is the matrix ( 0 −1 1 0 ) in SL2(Z), 1 is the trivial representation, and λ is the given label λ. The matrix element S1 λ refers to the action of S on E(S1 × S1), as computed in Exercise 30. Tensor Products I just mention that the vector space E(P ) of the pair of pants Figure 30: Pointed pair of pants plays a special role. Namely it is an (A × A × A)-comodule since there are 3 boundary components. Then if E1 and E2 are A-comodules we can form a new A-module E1 ⊗ E2 by taking a sort of double cotensor product over A: E1 ⊗ E2 = E1 ⊠A E(P ) ⊠A E2. This leads to a Hopf algebra structure on A, or more precisely to a Hopf algebra whose underlying coalgebra is isomorphic to A. Hopf algebras (and quasi-Hopf algebras) appeared in connection with ﬁnite groups in [DPR]. From the classical action one ﬁrst gets to the modular tensor categories, etc., which have been studied recently. The complete story is in in [F5]. 33 Lecture #4: Classical SU2 Chern-Simons Theory We move now to the Chern-Simons gauge theory with gauge group SU2, a topological theory in 2 + 1 dimensions. The action is no longer trivial, and the space of equivalence classes of ﬁelds is not ﬁnite, nor even discrete. So new geometric and analytic ideas now enter, and indeed I would say that they are far from understood at this writing. In this lecture we discuss the classical theory; in the next lecture we turn to the quantum theory. Classical mechanics and classical ﬁeld theory have long been studied by mathematicians, certainly dating back to Newton’s time. Over the years it has inspired many mathematical developments, notably the calculus of variations and symplectic geometry (corresponding to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian pictures of the theory). More recently, classical gauge theory in physics was discovered to ﬁt neatly into the independently developed mathematical theory of connections and curvature. So it is no surprise that the Chern-Simons lagrangian (see [CS] for the original reference in the mathematics literature) can be understood within our present-day mathematics. In fact, a careful study is illuminating, and I refer to my series of papers in progress [F1], [F2], and [F3] for a detailed development. A survey of these ideas appears in my lecture in the Colloquium connected to this Summer School [F4]. Here we outline some of the basic ideas for the SU2 case. Fixed Data The dimension of the theory is d = 2; this is a 2 + 1 dimensional theory. Our gauge group is the Lie group G = SU2 = {( α β − ¯β ¯α ) : α, β ∈ C, |α| 2 + |β| 2 = 1 } . As a manifold G is diﬀeomorphic to the 3-sphere S3. We also need to ﬁx a bilinear form on the Lie algebra g = su2 = {( ix α − ¯α −ix ) : x ∈ R, α ∈ C} . This bilinear form is (36) ⟨a, b⟩ = −k 8π2 Tr(ab), a, b ∈ SU2, for some integer k = 1, 2, . . . Note that (36) is invariant under conjugation. The reason for this normalization is the following. Let θ be the Maurer-Cartan 1-form on SU2. If g ∈ SU2 is written as a matrix, we write θ = g−1dg which is a matrix valued 1-form, and the values are elements of su2, i.e., traceless skew-hermitian matrices. 34 Exercise 32 Write g = ( α − ¯β β ¯α ) and write a formula for θ in terms of α, β. Our normalization of (36) is chosen so that (37) ∫ SU2 k 24π2 Tr(θ3) is an integer. Exercise 33 Verify (37). Fields Our spacetimes are compact oriented 3-manifolds X. The ﬁelds are gauge ﬁelds or connections: CX = {SU2 connections Θ over X}. What is a connection? First of all it lives on a principal G bundle P → X. So P is a manifold on which G acts (on the right) freely with quotient X. This is the same deﬁnition as in Lecture #2, where G was a ﬁnite group. But now SU2 has no nontrivial topology in dimensions 0 and 1, and some elementary topology proves that there exists an isomorphism P ∼= X × G, where X × G is the trivial G bundle with G action (X × G) × G −→ (X × G) ⟨x, g⟩ × h ↦−→ ⟨x, gh⟩. Another way to say this is to say that there exists a section p : X → P of the principal bundle π : P → X; that is, π ◦ p = idX . Since all SU2 bundles are trivial, we might think of ﬁxing once and for all P = X × G. However, as we saw in the theory with ﬁnite gauge group, this does not exhibit all of the symmetry when we glue bundles. Recall that an isomorphism of bundles is a map ϕ : P ′ → P such that ϕ(p′ · g) = ϕ(p′)g for all g ∈ G, p′ ∈ P ′ and ϕ induces the identity map on the quotients P ′/G = P/G = X. If p′ = p then ϕ is called a gauge transformation. We denote the group of gauge transformations by GP . Exercise 34 Show that the group of gauge transformations of the trivial bundles X × G can be identiﬁed with the group of maps Map(X, G) operating by left multiplication. Exercise 35 35 Figure 31: Horizontal lifts in a principal bundle with connection a) If X is a closed, oriented, and connected 3-manifold, use the 3-form (37) to show how to distinguish diﬀerent homotopy classes of maps X → G, i.e., diﬀerent components of Map(X, G). b) The set of components π0G of any group G has a natural group structure. Show that if X is a closed, oriented, and connected 3-manifold, then π0 Map(X, G) ∼= Z. Geometrically, a connection Θ is a structure on P which enables us to lift paths on X in a G- invariant way. (Figure 31) That is, given a path γ in X starting at x ∈ X, and a point p ∈ Px in the ﬁber of P over x, then there is a lifted path ˜γ in P starting at p so that π(˜γ) = γ. Of course such paths exist; the connection tells us how to choose one. If p′ = p · g is another point of Px, then the lifted path ˜γ′ starting at p′ must equal ˜γ ◦ g. We will return presently to the analytic expression for a connection. Chern-Simons Action on S3 As a warm-up we ﬁrst look at a geometric deﬁnition of holonomy for circle bundles with connec- tion. It suﬃces to consider the trivial bundle S1 × T π −→ S1. Here S1 is the circle as a manifold and T is the circle group, also called U1: T = {e iθ : θ ∈ R} = {λ ∈ C : |λ| = 1}. 36 Figure 32: Holonomy of a connection on a T bundle over S1 Now a connection on this bundle gives us a way to lift the base to a path in S1 × T, which is not necessarily closed, if we give an initial point p. Let q be the terminal point. Now in the ﬁber over x, here identiﬁed with T, we can measure the directed length from p to q. Suppose the total length of T is 1; then this directed length ℓ is only well-deﬁned up to addition of integers, since we can go around the circle any number of times to measure the directed length. So e 2πiℓ ∈ T is well-deﬁned, and this is the holonomy. (See Figure 32) For an SU2 connection over S3 the Chern-Simons action is deﬁned similarly. Consider the trivial bundle P = S3 × SU2 π −→ S3 with a connection Θ. Fix a point x in S3 and let x′ be the antipodal point. Also, ﬁx p ∈ Px. Then lift all of the semi-great circles from x to x′ starting at p. (See Figure 33.) The lifted paths terminate in the ﬁber Px′ which we identify with SU2. (Recall this is diﬀeomorphic to a 3-sphere.) These terminal points ﬁll out a 2-sphere in Px′. In fact, the semi-great circles are parametrized by the equatorial S2, so the terminal points comprise a map τ : S2 → Px′. Let R be an oriented region in Px′ whose boundary is the image of τ (Figure 34). Then the Chern- 37 Figure 33: Holonomy of a connection on an SU2 bundle over S3 Simons action is (38) SX (Θ) = ∫ R k 24π2 Tr(θ3). Because of the condition (37), if we change the region R, then (38) changes by an integer. So the quantity e 2πiSX (Θ) ∈ T is well-deﬁned. Notice that (38) is just the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten action for the map τ . Already we see a relationship between-Simons and Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten. We can think of this relationship as a transgression, which is not a sin, but rather a relationship in a ﬁber bundle between the geometry of the ﬁber and the geometry of the base (with a shift in dimension). Here the 2 dimensional geometry of the ﬁber is related to the 3 dimensional geometry of the base. Chern-Simons Action on closed spacetimes Now let Θ be a connection on a bundle π : P → X, where X is an arbitrary closed, oriented 3-manifold. We now need analytic formulas to deﬁne the Chern-Simons action. Rather than give an 38 Px’\u0000 R\u0000 image of τ\u0000 Figure 34: Bounding the image of τ abstract treatment of connections in general, which you can ﬁnd in my paper [F1], let me express this in a form often found in the physics literature. Thus suppose p : X → P is a section of P π −→ X, i.e., π ◦ p = idX . Set p∗Θ = A = Ai dxi relative to local coordinates x1, x 2, x 3 on X. Here Ai = Ai(x) are functions on X with values in the Lie algebra g. If p′ is a diﬀerent section, then we can write (39) p′ = p · g for some function g : X → G. We have p∗Θ = A1 = g−1Ag + g−1dg = ( g−1Ai g + g−1 ∂g ∂xi ) dxi. The curvature Ω is a g-valued 2-form on P constructed from the connection Θ, which recall is a g-valued 1-form on P : Ω = dΘ + 1 2 [Θ ∧ Θ]. The formula on X, induced by a section p : X → P , is perhaps more familiar: p∗Ω = F = dA + A2 = 1 2 Fij dxi ∧ dxj = 1 2 ( ∂Aj ∂xi − ∂Ai ∂xj + [Ai, Aj] ) dxi ∧ dxj. 39 Exercise 36 If p′ is another section as in (39), show p′∗Ω = F ′ = gF g−1. The Chern-Simons form α is a 3-form which lives on P : α = α(Θ) = ⟨Θ ∧ Ω⟩ − 1 6 ⟨Θ ∧ [Θ ∧ Θ]⟩. Again, the form on the base may look more familiar: p∗α = −k 8π2 Tr(A ∧ F − 1 3 A3) = −k 8π2 Tr( 1 2 AiFjk − 1 3 AiAjAk) ε ijk dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3. Exercise 37 a) Compute dα in case X has dimension ≥ 4. b) Compute (p′)∗α for the section (39) in terms of p∗α. Deﬁne an action which now depends on the section p: (40) SX (Θ, p) = ∫ X p∗α(Θ). We would like to get rid of the dependence on p, so we investigate how SX changes when we change p. Using Exercise 37b we see that for the section p′ (39): (41) SX (Θ, p′) = SX (Θ, p) + ∫ X d⟨g−1Ag ∧ g−1dg⟩ − 1 6 ∫ X ⟨g−1dg ∧ [g−1dg ∧ g−1dg]⟩. The second term vanishes by Stokes’ Theorem, if ∂X = 0. The third term can be rewritten as (42) ∫ X k 24π2 Tr ( (g−1dg)3) . If X is closed, this is an integer by (37). So (40) is independent of p up to an integer. Hence e 2πiSX (Θ) ∈ T, X closed, Θ ∈ CX , is well-deﬁned. Exercise 38 Check that if ϕ : P ′ → P is an isomorphism, then e 2πiSX (ϕ ∗Θ) = e 2πiSX (Θ) In particular, taking P ′ = P we see that the Chern-Simons action is gauge invariant. Exercise 39 Check how the action behaves under orientation reversal and disjoint union. Notice that our action does not quite ﬁt the axioms of Lecture #1, in particular (1). The value is not in R but rather in R/Z, or upon exponentiating, in T. There is a more drastic modiﬁcation of these axioms for manifolds with boundary. 40 Chern-Simons Action on spacetimes with boundary Suppose X is a compact oriented 3-manifold, possibly with nonempty boundary ∂X. Let Θ be a connection over X. We would like to compute the action by (40), but now we ﬁnd a more complicated dependence on the trivializing section p. Namely, (41) still holds since it is a local formula. But now the second term is (Stokes’ Theorem): ∫ X d⟨g−1Ag ∧ g−1dg⟩ = ∫ ∂X ⟨g−1Ag ∧ g−1dg⟩ = ∫ ∂X −k 8π2 Tr(g−1Ag ∧ g−1dg) = ∫ ∂X −k 8π2 Tr ( g−1Ai ∂g ∂yj ) ε ij dy1 ∧ dy2 Also, by the usual arguments for the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten term, the third term (42) just depends on the restriction ∂g of g to ∂X—call it W∂X (∂g)—if we consider it up to integers. Again we see the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten action in 1 + 1 dimensions related to Chern-Simons in 2 + 1. Set c∂X (a, g) = exp (2πi ∫ ∂X −k 8π2 Tr(g−1ag ∧ g−1dg) + W∂X (g)) where a is a 1-form on ∂X with values in g and g : ∂X → G. Then the preceding is summarized by (43) e 2πiSX (Θ,p·g) = c(p∗∂Θ, g)e 2πiSX (Θ,p). Both sides are elements of T, or if we like elements of unit norm in C—that is, complex numbers of norm one. So how do we make sense of the action? It certainly is not independent of the trivializing section p : X → P . But the variation depends on the boundary values ∂p : ∂X → ∂P of p and the restriction ∂Θ of Θ to the boundary ∂X. Let S∂P be the space of all sections of ∂P → ∂X. Then set L∂X,∂Θ = L∂Θ = {f : S∂P → C : f (q · g) = c(q∗∂Θ, g) · f (q)} for all g : ∂X → G. In other words, L∂Θ is the set of functions from sections of ∂P → ∂X to C which transform according to (43). This is a one dimensional complex vector space with an inner product, i.e., a hermitian line. Exercise 40 Verify this last assertion. Then equation (43) states that the action makes sense as an element of this hermitian line (of unit norm): e 2πiSX (Θ) ∈ L∂Θ. So again we must modify our axioms for an action. Now the action is exponentiated . For a closed spacetime it is an element of T (or C). For a nonclosed spacetime it is an element of a complex line. 41 The construction of this Chern-Simons line applies to any connection η an a G bundle Q → Y over a closed oriented 2-manifold Y —we obtain a line LY,η = Lη. Exercise 41 Verify the following properties of the lines Lη. a) (Functoriality) If ψ : Q ′ → Q is a bundle isomorphism for bundles Q ′, Q over Y , and η is a connection on Y , then there is an induced isometry (44) ψ∗ : Lψ∗η → Lη. b) (Orientation) There is an isometry L−Y,η ∼= LY,η. c) (Disjoint Union) There is an isometry Lη1⊔η2 ∼= Lη1 ⊗ Lη2 if η1, η2 are ﬁelds (connections) on Y1, Y2. Exercise 42 State and derive analogous properties of the Chern-Simons action. These should be analogous to the corresponding axioms in Lecture #1. Gluing Law Figure 35: Gluing connections The locality of a usual sort of action is the gluing law (6), (7). In Chern-Simons this gets modiﬁed to accommodate the diﬀerent sort of action that we have. Also, because of the exponential it looks like a multiplicativity property rather than an additivity property. Figure 35 illustrates a typical gluing. A closed 3-manifold X is cut along Y and a connection Θ cut into two connections Θ1, Θ2 which both restrict to η on Y . Then e 2πiSX1 (Θ1) ∈ LY,η, e 2πiSX2 (Θ2) ∈ L−Y,η ∼= LY,η. 42 The gluing axiom is (45) e 2πiSX (Θ) = ( e 2πiSX1 (Θ1), e 2πiSX2 (Θ2)) where the inner product takes place in LY,η. Exercise 43 Demonstrate (45). Classical Solutions We leave as an exercise the derivation of the variation of the action δSX (Θ) = 2 ∫ X −k 8π2 Tr(F ∧ δA) and the resultant Euler-Lagrange equations for the classical solutions: (46) F = 0. (If ∂X ̸= ∅ then we must assume that Θ is ﬁxed on ∂X.) So a solution is a ﬂat connection, i.e., a connection with zero curvature. Let MX = space of ﬂat connections on X up to equivalence. As with the ﬁnite group case in Lecture #2 (see (18)), where all connections are ﬂat, it is true that MX ≃ Hom(π1X, G)/G. This may be a ﬁnite set (see the Brieskorn spheres in Lecture #5) or it may have continuous parameters. Hamiltonian Theory The Hamiltonian theory concerns spacetimes which are products of space and time, or better paths of ﬁelds in a space Y . Thus we study X = [0, ∞) × Y . (The fact that this particular X is noncompact won’t bother us.) Fix a G bundle Q → Y , which is of course trivializable. Let AQ = space of connections on Q. Then up to gauge equivalence any connection on [0, ∞) × Q → [0, ∞) × Y is a path in AQ, as we see using the “temporal gauge”. We want to see what the action is on such paths, but now on closed paths. 43 Let ηt, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, be a path of connections on Q. We view this as a connection η on the product bundle [0, 1] × Q → [0, 1] × Y which has no dt component, i.e., in the temporal gauge. So we can consider the action e 2πiS[0,1]×Y (η). It is an element of the line attached to the boundary connections η0 ⊔ η1. Because the orientation on the left of the cylinder is opposite the orientation on the right, Figure 36: [0, 1] × Y the action is a linear map (47) e 2πiS[0,1]×Y (η) : Lη0 → Lη1. We picture this in Figure 37. The lines Lη ﬁt together into a complex line bundle (48) LQ → AQ and the action gives us a way of lifting paths to act on LQ. The gluing law for the action implies that these maps compose properly when we glue paths together (Figure 38). One can show that this means that (47) is the parallel transport of a connection on the bundle (48). This is the link between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Theories. One computes the curvature of this connection to be ω(δ1A, δ2A) = −2 ∫ Y −k 8π2 Tr(δ1A ∧ δ2A) where δiA are inﬁnitesimal variations of the gauge ﬁeld, i.e., tangent vectors in AQ. This curvature is a symplectic form on AQ. Figure 37: The action as parallel transport 44 Figure 38: Composing paths and parallel transports Again: The action on a path in the space of ﬁelds on space is the parallel transport for a connection on that space of ﬁelds. If the lagrangian is nondegenerate, its curvature is a symplectic form. Many mathematical treatments of Hamiltonian mechanics begin with this symplectic structure. Here we derive it from a Lagrangian theory. Also, (44) says that the action of gauge transformations GQ on AQ lifts to the line bundle LQ. This lift is also constructed directly from the Chern-Simons action. So not only does the Hamiltonian Theory involve a symplectic manifold AQ (phase space), but the action produces a line bundle LQ → AQ with a connection whose curvature is the symplectic form. And, as mentioned, the gauge transformations GQ lift to act on LQ. From this lifted action we can compute a momentum map for the action of GQ. Phase space reduction consists of restricting to the zero momentum subspace and then dividing out by GQ. Geometrically, the zero momentum space is the subspace of AQ over which the connection on LQ drops to the quotient AQ/GQ. This is the space of ﬂat connections, and so we obtain a quotient line bundle with connections LY → MY . Here MY is the set of ﬂat connections on Y up to equivalence. This Chern-Simons line bundle and connection enters the quantization of the theory. This construction of the line bundle appears in [RSW]. Beyond the Hamiltonian Theory Recall from Lecture #3 that we obtain a more intricate algebraic structure by considering (in that simple quantum theory) surfaces with boundary. it is natural to ask whether in this classical theory, and ultimately in its quantized version, one can proﬁtably deal with surfaces with boundary. The answer is yes, though the story which develops is quite complicated. It involves strange algebraic objects called gerbes. We avoided them in Lecture #3 by introducing basepoints; that can be done here as well [F1,§4–§5]. The full story will be presented in [F2] and [F3]. There we will ﬁnally understand the classical Chern-Simons action (for arbitrary gauge group) as the integral of the lagrangian over spacetime, just as ordinary actions, such as the harmonic map action(2), are integrals of a lagrangian over spacetime. Furthermore, one dimension lower we see the Chern-Simons line as the integral of the lagrangian over space. And this continues to lower dimensions and more 45 complicated integrations. (See [F4] for a survey.) But in these topological theories the lagrangian and the integral are somewhat exotic. 46 Lecture #5: Quantum SU2 Chern-Simons Theory: Computer Calculations Although present-day mathematics is well-suited to describe classical ﬁeld theory, and the Chern- Simons theory in particular, the quantum ﬁeld theory most likely requires new mathematical ideas. Certainly there is a large literature on the mathematics of quantum ﬁeld theory, and there is much nontrivial progress towards understanding many aspects. But I think it is fair to say that the mechanism of quantization is still by and large a mystery. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that quantum ﬁeld theory will lead to new developments in mathematics; indeed, it already has. Certainly mathematics has also contributed to quantum ﬁeld theory as well. But, as I say, I believe there is more mystery here than light. In this ﬁnal lecture we abandon our theoretical tools and turn to computations in the quantum Chern-Simons theory. This is joint work with Bob Gompf, and is based on an inﬂuential paper of Witten [W1]. Witten considers the Chern-Simons theory for SU2 at “level” k, as discussed in the previous lecture. (He also treats other gauge groups, but we stick to SU2.) He does two things: (i) Gives a prescription for computing the exact path integral ZX (k), depending on the level k; (ii) Gives an asymptotic formula for ZX (k) as k → ∞ by standard perturbation theory techniques. The exact solution in (i) is, I believe, quite rare in quantum ﬁeld theory; usually one only has the perturbation theory (ii). The asymptotic formula (see (53) below) involves more or less standard topological invariants of the closed oriented 3-manifold X and representations of its fundamental group. Witten asserts that the exact formula for ZX (k) is a topological invariant, and this has been borne out by the work of Reshetikhin/Turaev [RT], Walker [Wa] and others. They start with complicated algebraic data and construct the exact solution. Recall that this is the reverse of what we did in Lecture #3. From the special properties of the algebraic data they can prove the properties of quantum ﬁeld theory (functoriality, gluing, etc.). In particular, they prove that ZX (k) is a topological invariant. While this is very important work, and an important step towards understanding Chern-Simons theory, it should be pointed out that: (i) This work never mentions the Chern-Simons action. (ii) Locality is not immediately apparent from this algebraic data. Better, I don’t know of a notion of “locality” in their algebraic data which would suggest why one gets out a ﬁeld theory. (iii) They do not discuss the perturbative expansion, and it is not at all clear how the topological invariants involved in that expansion (see (53)) emerge from this algebraic data. I only mean these comments to indicate that there is a long way to go towards understanding locality and quantum ﬁeld theory in a manner usable in a variety of geometric and topological problems. They are not at all a criticism of this beautiful work, which is an important step towards a more complete understanding these theories. We do computations of ZX (k) for some relatively simple 3-manifolds X—lens spaces X = L(p, q) 47 and Brieskorn spheres X = ∑(p, q, r). We will see the desired properties of the exact solution in our computations, and we will also see that the partition function is a nontrivial eﬀective topological invariant, at least in these simple examples. We will also compute ZX (k) for large values of k and compare with the asymptotic formula predicted by perturbation theory. We ﬁnd excellent numerical agreement. For lens spaces this is now understood in analytic terms (i.e., proved!), but for Brieskorn spheres the analytic results are only qualitative. 1 (See the theses of Lisa Jeﬀrey [J] and Stavros Garoufalidis [G].) The agreement between the exact solution and the perturbation theory, though expected from formal arguments, is another mystery about the path integral which we don’t really understand, and which hints at new geometric structures. Another discussion of these results from a physics perspective is contained in [FG2]. The complete results are contained in [FG1]. Since these references should be fairly accessible and readily available, our discussion here is brief. Exact Solution Let e 2πiSX (Θ) denote the Chern-Simons action constructed in the last lecture for k = 1; then the action for arbitrary k is e 2πikSX (Θ). An important point to remember is this: We do not have measures available on the space of ﬁelds, so cannot quantize directly using measure theory as we did in Lecture #2. Of course, we can assume the existence of a measure dµX on the space of ﬁelds, assume that the measure has all the good properties we need, and write a formal path integral ZX (k) = ∫ CX e 2πikSX (Θ) dµX (Θ), X 3 closed, and suppose that we have a map (49) Y ⇝ E(Y ), Y 2 closed, from closed 2-manifolds to ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces such that these maps satisfy the axioms of Lecture #1. (In fact, there is an anomaly which enters, which leads to certain central extensions and to the requirement that our spaces and spacetimes have a little more structure. We refer to Witten’s paper [W1] for this and for more about the entire theory.) We also have the path integral over 3-manifolds with boundary, and we assume that we also have the reﬁned theory involving surfaces with boundary as discussed in Lecture #3. Now, of course, Witten does not merely assume all of this and go on. There are deﬁnite criteria which indicate whether a quantum theory makes sense, and what modiﬁcations may have to be made (e.g., anomalies). Also, the procedure for producing the quantum Hilbert spaces (49) is well-studied—it is usually called canonical quantization and is the Hamiltonian picture of quantum theory. In this case Witten also appeals to geometric quantization for the construction of the quantum Hilbert space. There is much mathematical work towards justifying this construction (for example [ADW], [H]). Further, Witten noticed that the construction ﬁts into conformal ﬁeld theory, 1As we write Lev Rozansky is making great strides towards an analytic understanding. 48 more speciﬁcally rational conformal ﬁeld theory, and so he was able to borrow results from there to compute with the E(Y ). This is also one entree into the theory (discussed in Lecture #3) involving surfaces with boundary. In any case, we simply observe here that the quantum Chern-Simons theory in 2 + 1 dimensions is related to the quantum Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (topological) theory in 1 + 1 dimensions, just as the corresponding classical theories are related. Just a word about the quantization. Recall the line bundle with connection (50) LY → MY over the space of ﬂat connections on Y . If Y is given a complex structure, then MY and LY inherit a complex structure, and the quantization is E(Y ) = Hol(MY ; LY ) the space of holomorphic sections of (50). To see that this is well-deﬁned we must check that it is independent of the complex structure. (In fact, only the underlying projective space is independent, since there is an anomaly.) This is like quantizing a classical system with variables p, q by the Hilbert space Hol(q + p√−1) of holomorphic functions of the complex variable q + p√ −1. Other choices are possible and typical—for example, L 2 functions of q or L 2 functions of p. One of the main problems in quantizing is to identify all of the diﬀerent quantizations, at least projectively, and that is what the mathematical work referred to in the previous paragraph does for the Chern-Simons theory. These spaces have led to a solution of some mathematical old problems about MY , which are of interest in the theory of Riemann surfaces. The torus One can identify the vector space E(S1 × S1) ∼= C{e1, . . . , ek+1} as the span of certain vectors e1, . . . , ek+1. (This canonical basis can be deduced from the reﬁned gluing laws analogous to those in Lecture #3.) The axioms of topological ﬁeld theory say that the orientation-preserving diﬀeomorphisms of S1 × S1 should act on E(S1 × S1), and the action only depends on homotopy classes of diﬀeomorphisms (see Exercise 18). That is, SL2(Z) acts on E(S1 × S1). From conformal ﬁeld theory, and ultimately from the theory of Kaˇc-Moody Lie algebras [KM], one concludes that the generators T = ( 1 1 0 1 ) and S = ( 0 −1 1 0 ) act on E(S1 × S1) via the matrices ̃T α β = e 2πi(hα−c/24)δα β ; ̃Sα β = √ 2 k + 2 sin ( αβπ k + 2 ) 49 where c = 3k k + 2 ; hα = α2 − 1 4(k + 1) . These are the explicit formulas we use in our computations below. Other considerations from conformal ﬁeld theory show (51) dim E(S2) = 1. Surgery Formulas So canonical quantization, or rather the link between the path integral and canonical quantization, together with some results from conformal ﬁeld theory and Kaˇc-Moody Lie algebras (or better topological Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten Theory) are one part of the exact solution. One should note that this makes heavy use of symmetry. The other part of the exact solution we need is derived directly from the set of axioms (see Lecture #1) that the path integral is meant to satisfy. We need a starting point, and this is (52) ZS1×S2 = 1, which follows from (51) and (27). The other main tool is the Gluing Law(16), from which we derive the change of the path integral under surgery. Figure 39: Writing S1 × S2 as the union of 2 solid tori Let T ⊂ S1 × S2 be a solid torus as shown in Figure 39. The complement X = (S1 × S2) − T is also a solid torus. We have S1 × S2 = X ∪ T glued along the common boundary ∂T ∼= S1 × S1, which is an ordinary torus. This factors the partition function (52) into 1 = (ZX , ZT )E(S1×S1). 50 If we glue X and T together by a diﬀeomorphism f of ∂T ∼= S1 × S1, then the Functoriality Axiom and the Gluing Law imply that ZX∪f T = (ZX , f∗ZT )E(S1×S1), where X ∪f T is the new 3-manifold obtained by this surgery. If f = ( q r p s ) ∈ SL2Z then the resulting manifold is the lens space L(p, q). A similar surgery on 3 parallel solid tori in S1 × S2 yields the Brieskorn sphere ∑ (p, q, r). This is a sketch of the procedure given by Witten, and used by Gompf and me to compute some of the exact partition functions which we compute below. Perturbation Theory In this theory one should think of k = 1/ℏ, except that ℏ is now “quantized” to be the reciprocal of an integer. So here the perturbative limit ℏ → 0 is k → ∞. The leading order behavior is determined around the critical points of the classical action, which are the (equivalence classes of) ﬂat connections A ∈ MX (see (46)). The perturbation theory then gives a formula in terms of topological invariants of the ﬂat connection A. For simplicity we state it when the space MX is ﬁnite and consists entirely of irreducible connections. This holds for X = ∑ (p, q, r), for example. The asymptotic formula is (53) ZX (k) ∼ 1 2 e −3πi/4 ∑ A∈MX √ τX (A) e −2πiIA/4e 2πi(k+2)SX (A) where TX (A) = Reidemeister torsion of X with coeﬃcients twisted by A; IA = a certain “spectral ﬂow”. It is an integer determined modulo 8. The Reidemeister torsion is a topological invariant introduced a long time ago to distinguish various lens spaces [R], [Fr]. It appears here in the form of analytic torsion, which was introduced by Ray and Singer [RS] as a certain combination of determinants of Laplace operators. The equality of the analytic torsion and Reidemeister torsion was established by Cheeger [C] and M¨uller [M]. The spectral ﬂow is a topological invariant introduced by Atiyah/Patodi/Singer [APS]. Note the shift k → k + 2 in the action, which occurs in various guises in diﬀerent accounts of the Chern-Simons theory. We emphasize that (53) is derived (by Witten—see also [FG1,§1]) using standard Gaussian integrals and gauge ﬁxing, together with a mathematical theorem which identiﬁes a certain combination of determinants as the Reidemeister torsion. 51 The Computations We present only a few representative computations here. More complete results can be found in [FG1]. We gave surgery descriptions of the lens space L(p, q) and the Brieskorn sphere Σ(p, q, r) above. (Here p, q and p, q, r are pairwise relatively prime.) Now we give another description of these spaces simply to help the reader picture them. For the lens space, we start with the 3-sphere S3 thought of as the set of points in C2 = {⟨z, w⟩} of unit norm. Let the cyclic group Z/pZ act on C2 by letting the generator be the transformation ⟨z, w⟩ ↦−→ ⟨ωz, ωqw⟩, where ω = e 2πi/p. This restricts to a free action on S3 if p and q are relatively prime. The quotient of S3 by this action is the lens space L(p, q). In other words, there is a p : 1 covering S3 → L(p, q). Notice that L(2, 1) is the familiar projective space RP 3. For the Brieskorn sphere Σ(p, q, r) with p, q, r pairwise relatively prime, begin with the complex surface Z deﬁned by the equation zp 1 + zq 2 + zr 3 = 0 in C3. Let S5 denote the unit 5-sphere in C3. Then Σ(p, q, r) = Z ∪ S5. Table 1: Asymptotic values of the Witten invariant for L(12, 5) Our ﬁrst data in Table 1 is for the lens space L(12, 5). For some fairly large values of k we display both the exact value of the path integral and the asymptotic value, as predicted by (53). (In fact, 52 (53) must be modiﬁed to account for the fact that ﬂat SU2 connections on L(12, 5) are reducible.) This perturbative formula works out to be ZL(12,5)(k) ∼ i 2 √2 √ 12 · (k + 2) { 4 sin2( 2 12 π)e 2πi( 5 12 )(k+2) − 4 sin2( 4 12 π)e 2πi( 8 12 )(k+2) + 4 sin2( 6 12 π)e 2πi( 9 12 )(k+2) − 4 sin2( 4 12 π)e 2πi( 8 12 )(k+2) + 4 sin2( 2 12 π)e 2πi( 5 12 )(k+2) }. Notice the diﬀerent signs, which come from the spectral ﬂow term. The numerical agreement observed in Table 1 has now been veriﬁed analytically [J]. Table 2: Asymptotic values of the Witten invariant for Σ(2, 3, 17) Our second example is the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2, 3, 17). This example is better since, except for the trivial connection, all ﬂat SU2 connections are irreducible and isolated points in the space of ﬂat connections (up to equivalence). In fact, there are exactly 6 of them! So the asymptotic formula (53) 53 works out to be (54) ZΣ(2,3,17)(k) ∼ √ 2 17 e −3πi/4{ sin( π 17 )e −πi(k+2)/204 + sin( 4π 17 )e −169πi(k+2)/204 − sin( 8π 17 )e −217πi(k+2)/204 + sin( 3π 17 )e −145πi(k+2)/204 + sin( 2π 17 )e −361πi(k+2)/204 − sin( 7π 17 )e −49πi(k+2)/204 }. As you can see from Table 2, the exact solution is indeed asymptotic to (54), at least numerically. 54 References [A] M. F. Atiyah, Topological quantum ﬁeld theory, Publ. Math. Inst.
