Light does not involve the oscillation of particles. Light is a transverse wave. Wave equation for electromagetic waves are two constants which describe how well waves propagate through electric and magnetic media the o subscript tells about the propagation in free space – the vacuum (c=299792458 ms-1). For materials with values of relative permittivity (r) and relative permeability (r) the velocity of the light is n cc v rr   where n is the refractive index n>1, light travels slower in matter. There are two guiding principles that we shall employ extensively: 1. Huygen’s principle Each point on a wavefront serves as the source of spherical secondary wavelets that advance with a speed and frequency equal to those of the primary wave. Christian Huygens Fermat’s Principle (Pierre de Fermat) The actual path between two points taken by a beam of light is the one which is traversed in the least time (dt/dl=0). qi=qr’, qr’=qr, hence qi=qr Reflection from a surface Angle of incidence Angle of reflectionTo find the minimum time, we need to solve for x such that Which is This is Snell’s law Refraction ni nt Relationship between Huygen’s and Fermat’s Principles Speed of light in a medium is less than in vacuum. Speed is characterised by index of refraction (n) n=c/v For water n=1.333 air n=1.0003 http://tap.iop.org/vibration/reflection/317/page_46713.html If normal incidence: Velocity change, no direction change. When light strikes the boundary surface, there is a transmitted and reflected component (just as with waves on a string). reflected refracted n1 n2 n1<n2 qi qt qi ’ qi= qi ’ (angle of incidence = angle of reflection) n1sin(qi)=n2sin(qt) (Snell’s law) Light travels at speed c in vacuum, and this is independent of wavelength. Refractive index changes with frequency of light, so light of different wavelengths travel at different speeds in a medium. Quartz Water n is larger for shorter wavelengths. So higher frequency light is slower in a medium. Higher frequency light bends more at the interface. If light travels through a medium with a non-uniform n, light tends to bend towards regions of high n. http://www.instant-analysis.com/Principles/spectra.htm Increasing n The sketch is not to scale, and the Sun is a lot further away than shown. When you see the Sun just above horizon, the Sun has actually already set. Pinhole camera http://en.wikipedia.org","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
