As the angle of incidence is increased from zero, the first strong interference maximum is found when the beam makes an angle of 18.0 o with the planes of the crystal. a) Calculate the distance between the adjacent planes. [4 marks] b) Find the angles at which any further interference maxima occur. State what condition must be satisfied for further maxima to occur? [4 marks] c) Find the longest wavelength for which two interference maxima would be produced. [2 marks]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
