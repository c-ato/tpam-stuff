The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Problem 3.1 Mixing water We end up with 500 g of water at a new temperature. To deduce the new temperature, the heat leaving the hotter body, Q1 must equal the heat arriving at the cooler body. So let us denote the masses of the two bodies of water as m1 and m2, and their initial temperatures as T1 and T2 respectively. Then energy is conserved (and no work is done) so: m1c((T1 − Tf) = m2c(Tf − T2) ⇒ m1T1 + m2T2 = (m2 + m1)Tf ⇒ m1T1 + m2T2 (m2 + m1) = Tf ⇒ ( 0.1 × 100 + 0.4 × 20 0.5 ) ◦C = Tf = 36 ◦C . Problem 3.2 Hot electronics Let the mass of the silicon be m, and the speciﬁc heat be C. Then we may use ∆Q = mC∆T ⇒ dQ dt = mC dT dt ⇒ dT dt = 1 mC dQ dt ⇒ dT dt = 1 20 × 10−6 × 7055 × 10 −3 K s−1 = 0.3 K s−1 . Problem 3.3 Expansion A gas is kept at constant pressure. Its temperature is changed from Ti = 50 ◦C to Tf = 100 ◦C. To determine by what factor does its volume change, use the equation of state. The number of moles is unchanged and pi = pf = p. Thus pVi Ti = nR = pVf Tf ⇒ Vf Vi = Tf Ti = 373 323 = 1.15 . Note the temperatures must be stated in Kelvins. Problem 3.4 Isothermal expansion An ideal gas is initially at temperature 20 ◦C, pressure 200 kPa and has a volume of 4 litres. It undergoes an isothermal expansion until its pressure is reduced to 100 kPa. 3 THERMODYNAMICS, IDEAL GASES – SOLUTIONS 2 From this we may deduce the ﬁnal volume using the equation of state, simpliﬁed by the isothermal nature of the expansion. piVi = nRT = pfVf ⇒ Vf = Vi Pi pf = 4 × 2 × 10 5 105 litres = 8 litres . I.e the volume doubles. Note 1 litre = 10 −3 m3. To ﬁnd the work done by the gas, we use the equation of state to deduce p(V ), deﬁning the constant temperature to be T0: pV = nRT0 ⇒ p = nRT0 V ⇒ Wby = ∫ Vf Vi dV p = ∫ Vf Vi dV nRT0 V = nRT0 ln (Vf/Vi) = nRT0 ln 2 = piVi ln 2 = 2 × 10 5 × 4 × 10 −3 ln 2 J (use ln 2 ≃ 0.69.) ≃ 8 × 10 2 × 0.69 J ≃ 554 J . To ﬁnd the heat transfer, note that this was an isothermal process for an ideal gas, so the internal energy is unchanged. Thus we may use the First Law to deduce the heat transfer into the body: 0 = Won + Qin ⇒ 0 = −Wby + Qin ⇒ Qin = Wby ⇒ Qin = 554 J . Problem 3.5 Adiabatic expansion To ﬁnd the initial volume, Vi, we use the equation of state: Vi = nRTi pi = 1 × 8.3 × 273 10 × 105 m3 = 2.3 × 10 −3 m3 . To obtain the ﬁnal volume, Vf, we use the expression for an adiabatic process. We are told that the gas is a monatomic gas, so γ = 5/3. Thus: PfV γ f = PiV γ i ⇒ Vf = ( PiV γ i pf )1/γ = ( [2.3 × 10 −3]5/3 10 2 )3/5 m3 ≃ ( 2 × 10 −4)3/5 m 3 ≃ 6 × 10 −3 m 3 . 3 THERMODYNAMICS, IDEAL GASES – SOLUTIONS 3 To ﬁnd the ﬁnal temperature use the equation of state as we know pf, Vf and the number of moles is constant n. Thus: Tf = pfVf nR = 2 × 10 5 × 6 × 10 −3 1 × 8.3 K ≃ 143 K . To obtain the work done by the gas, we use the adiabatic relation: Wby = ∫ Vf Vi dV p = ∫ Vf Vi dV piV γ i V γ = piV γ i [V −γ+1 1 − γ ]Vf Vi = −3 210 6 × 4 × 10 −5(30.3 − 57.4) J ≃ 1620 J Problem 3.6 A simple thermodynamic cycle The cycle is as shown in Fig. (3.1) Since the ﬁrst step is isothermal we may use the equation Figure 3.1: The simple thermodynamic cycle. of state to say that piVi = nRTi = nRTf = pfVf ⇒ pf = piVi Vf . 3 THERMODYNAMICS, IDEAL GASES – SOLUTIONS 4 Then we may derive the work performed in this compression: W (1) on = − ∫ Vf Vi p dV using equation of state = −piVi ∫ Vf Vi dV V = −piVi ln ( Vf Vi ) noting Vf < Vi = piVi ln ( Vi Vf ) . No work is done on the second step as the volume is ﬁxed. On the ﬁnal step, the pressure is constant so the work integral is straightforward: W (3) on = − ∫ Vi Vf pi dV = −pi ∫ Vi Vf dV = −pi(Vi − Vf) < 0 . Thus the total work performed is positive (see Fig. (3.1)) and is: W tot on = piVi ln ( Vf Vi ) − pi(Vi − Vf) . Since we have a cyclic process the change in internal energy, ∆U = 0, so the First Law tells us that: 0 = W tot on + Qin ⇒ Qin = −W tot on < 0 . Thus this is a refrigeration cycle. Problem 3.7 Bow tie cycle The key variables here are the initial (p1, V1), with associated temperature T1 = p1V1/(nR), and the temperature of the isotherm, say T0. 1. We use adiabatic nature of compression to derive p2: p1V γ 1 = p2V γ 2 = p2 ( V1 2 )γ ⇒ p2 = 2 γp1 . 2. Use the equation of state here, noting the temperature is constant during the expan- sion: p4V1 = nRT0 ⇒ p4 = nRT0 V1 and p3 V1 2 = nRT0 ⇒ p3 = 2nRT0 V1 . 3 THERMODYNAMICS, IDEAL GASES – SOLUTIONS 5 3. Firstly the work done under the adiabatic compression: W ad on = − ∫ V1/2 V1 p dV = − ∫ V1/2 V1 p1V γ 1 V γ dV = −p1V γ 1 [ V −γ+1 −γ + 1 ]V1/2 V1 = p1V γ 1 γ − 1 [( V1 2 )−γ+1 − V −γ+1 1 ] = p1V1 γ − 1 [ 1 2−γ+1 − 1 ] = p1V1 γ − 1 [ 2 γ−1 − 1 ] > 0 (3.1) Then the work done on the gas as it undergoes an isothermal expansion: W isothermal on = − ∫ V1 V1/2 p dV = − ∫ V1 V1/2 nRT0 V dV = −nRT0 [ln(V1) − ln(V1/2)] = −nRT0 ln(2) < 0 (3.2) 4. Firstly note no work is performed on the \"vertical\" sections of the cycle as they occur at constant volume. Then we should add the other two contributions calculated above, ie Eq. (3.1) and Eq. (3.2). Thus the total work done on the gas is W tot on = p1V1 γ − 1 [2 γ−1 − 1 ] − nRT0 ln(2) . If we set the total work to zero we obtain an equation for the temperature of the isotherm, T0: T0 = p1V1 γ − 1 [2 γ−1 − 1] nR ln(2) = [2 γ−1 − 1] (γ − 1) ln(2)T1 , where p1V1 = nRT1 deﬁnes the original temperature. Problem 3.8 The atmospheric lapse rate For an adiabatic process, dU = −p dV ⇔ dU + p dV = 0 ⇒ mcvdT + p dV = 0 . (3.3) Here we have exploited the ideal gas assumption, so U (T ) is only a function of T . Now for an adiabatic process, f (p, V ) = pV γ = constant. Take diﬀerentials of both sides df = 0 = ∂f ∂p dp + ∂f ∂V dV = 0 ⇒ V γdp + γpV γ−1dV = 0 ⇒ V dp + γp dV = 0 ⇒ p dV = −γ−1V dp . (3.4) 3 THERMODYNAMICS, IDEAL GASES – SOLUTIONS 6 We may now substitute Eq. (3.4) into Eq. (3.3) to obtain: mcvdT − γ−1V dp = 0 cpdT − 1 ρ dp = 0 , (3.5) using γ−1 = cv/cp and V /m = ρ −1. Now use the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium we derived when discussing the isothermal atmosphere: dp = −ρgdh . Upon substituting this into Eq. (3.5), we see: dT = − g cp dh ⇒ Γd = dT dh = − g cp . Thus for dry air, Γd ≃ 10 −2 Km−1 = 10 K km−1. This is faster than experiment (6.5 K km−1), so a displaced packet of dry air will cool faster than the surroundings as it rises and this will make it stable – i.e. it will fall back downwards.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
