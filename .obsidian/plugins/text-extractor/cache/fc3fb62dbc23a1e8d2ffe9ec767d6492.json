Convert the following binary numbers into fractions 0.010101 ˙0 ˙1 0.01100110 ˙011 ˙0 0.101101 ˙10 ˙1 Answer 1. We can tackle the ﬁrst number by multiplying by 22 to get 22x = 22 × 0.010101 ˙0 ˙1 = 1.010101 ˙0˙1 = 1 + x ⇒ x = 1 Since 17=16+1 we have 17x = 1 ⇒ 16x = 0 + 1 − x ⇒ x = 0.0000111100001111 ˙0000111 ˙1 3 Since 8=9-1 we can use 8x = 1 ⇒ 9x = 1 + x ⇒ x = 0.0101 ˙0˙1 Obviously 1 and the digits advance by one along the number. For the second quarter M [0.1a¯2a¯3a¯4...] = 0.3333333.... For the third quarter x = 1 Depict this function and show how to apply it to a number which is represented in base 8. Find a representation for the numbers which do not end up at zero eventually. Answer 6. The function depicts as 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Map xM(x) and clearly base 8 is suitable to represent the map. For the ﬁrst eighth we have M [0.0a¯2a¯3a¯4...] = 0.a¯2a¯3a¯4... and for the second eighth we can use x = 1 and so M [0.4a¯2a¯3a¯4...] = 0.a¯2a¯3a¯4... for the sixth eighth we can use x = 5 Answer 7. The depiction is -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Map xM(x) To convert into base 3 we employ z ≡ 0.0a¯2a¯3... to hive oﬀ the ﬁrst digit M [−0.2a¯2a¯3...] = M [− 2 and we end up with a 2d-cycle instead of a d-cycle, if there are d digits. Using a single digit we have 0.0 ˙0 ↦→ 0.0 ˙0 x = 0 0.1 ˙1 ↦→ 0.1 ˙1 3x = 1 + x ⇒ x = 1 −0.1012 ˙101 ˙2 ↦→ −0.2101 ˙210 ˙1 9x = −10 − 1 − x ⇒ x = − 4 0.221001 ˙22100 ˙1 ↦→ −0.210012 ˙21001 ˙2 27x = 221 + 1 − x ⇒ x = 26 −0.101 ˙10 ˙1 ↦→ −0.211 ˙21 ˙1 27x = −101 + x ⇒ x = − 10Depict this map. Find a base 5 representation for this map and use it to ﬁnd all the 1-cycles. Answer 8. The map depicts as -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Map xM(x) and we may ﬁnd the 1-cycles directly by solving x = 4 + 5x x = −2 − 5x x = 5x x = 2 − 5x x = 5x − 4 which gives x ∈ { − 1, − 1 M [0.1a¯2a¯3...] = M [ 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
