Open circuits S/C 1. What is the behaviour of the inductor immediately after the switch is closed at t = 0? 2. What is the initial voltage across the 125 Ω resistor immediately after the switch is closed (0 < t < 1 ms)? V (R125Ω) = 24V 3. After a sufficiently long time after the switch has been closed, how does the inductor behave? 4. After a sufficiently long time after the switch is closed, what will be the voltage across the 125 Ω resistor? V (R125Ω) = 0V 5. While the switch is closed, what is the Thévenin equivalent resistance looking back into the circuit from the inductor’s perspective? RT h = 100Ω 6. What is the time constant of the circuit when 0 < t < 1 ms? τ = L R = 0.2 ms 7. What is the voltage across the 125 Ω resistor at t = 1 ms? Vinit − Vinit (1 − e − t τ ) = Vinite − t τ = 24 ⋅ e − 1×10−3 2×10−4 = 14.5 … V ≈ 15V 8. What is the current flowing through the inductor at t = 1 ms? i = V R (1 − e − Rt L ) = 0.094 … A 9. What is the voltage across the 125 Ω resistor immediately after the switch is opened (t > 1 ms)? V = 15V 10. What is the time constant of the circuit after the switch is opened (t > 1 ms)? τ = 0.2 ms","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
