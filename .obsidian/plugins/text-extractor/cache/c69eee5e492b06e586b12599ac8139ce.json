Spherical aberrations - non axial rays come to a different focus, and thus image is blurred. The non-paraxial rays are usually removed using an aperture. - Paraxial ray: a ray makes a small angle to the optical axis. Objectives: 1. Use simple geometry to derive the mirror equation 2. Learn to use the mirror equation to find images 3. Use ray-diagrams to locate images. C P   P’ A    lV V: Vertex of the mirror CV: Optic axis s s’r All distances measured from V αr ρ For plane mirror, r=∞, hence f=∞, and s= –s’ f is the focal length of the mirror When parallel rays incident onto the mirror, they are focused at the focal point which is at distance f from the vertex. Focal length of a spherical mirror: f = r/2 f takes the same sign as r. F, the focal point. When parallel rays incident onto mirror, the rays are brought to focus at F. If a point object is placed at F, all reflected rays are parallel to the optic axis. Sign for r. When the centre of curvature C is on the same side as the outgoing light, the radius of curvature is positive. Concave mirror Convex mirror - parallel rays strike the mirror and are focused at F at a distance r/2 - the outgoing wavefronts appear to emanate from F behind the mirror. Rays appear to diverge from F. r is negative, f is negative The mirror equation is applicable to both Concave and convex mirrors. Different signs for r and hence f. Ray diagrams Draw 3 rays 1. parallel 2. focal 3. radial Note. if s < f image is behind mirror and virtual and need a different construction Convention for s is +ve/-ve if object is in front/behind mirror s’ is +ve/-ve if image is in front/behind mirror f/r +ve/-ve if mirror is concave/convex For a concave mirror, depending on the object distance, The image can be real and inverted, or virtual and erect. (Cosmetic mirror) Ray diagram for convex mirror Magnification: negative magnification hence image is inverted. Principle rays for concave mirror: Y&F P1124. 1) Ray parallel to axis reflects through the focal point. 2) Ray through focal point reflects parallel to axis. 3) Ray through centre reflects along its original path. 4) Ray to vertex reflects symmetrically around optic axis. Principle rays for convex mirror: Y&F P1124. 1) Reflected parallel ray appears to come from focal point. 2) Ray towards focal point reflects parallel to axis. 3) Ray towards centre reflects along its original path. 4) Ray to vertex reflects symmetrically around optic axis. Better do an example or two!
