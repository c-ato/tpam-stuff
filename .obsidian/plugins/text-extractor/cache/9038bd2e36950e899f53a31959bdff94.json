Evans d.evans@bham.ac.uk Last Lecture • Calculating electrical potential • Calculating V if E-field known • Calculating E-field from V – I.e. Using 𝐸 = −𝛻𝑉 • Calculating change in potential energy 2 This Lecture • Another example of calculating electric potential and then E-field. • The electric dipole 3 Extra Example by Request • Consider two identical charges, Q a distance L apart. • What is the potential exactly in between the two charges? • Use 𝐸 = −𝛻𝑉 to calculate the E-field at this point 4 L Q Q Extra Example by Request • First let’s see how NOT to solve this problem. • Potential in the middle, a distance x from each charge (sum potential from each charge): • 𝑉 = 𝑄 4𝜋𝜀0𝑥 + 𝑄 4𝜋𝜀0𝑥 = 𝑄 2𝜋𝜀0𝑥 𝐸 = − 𝑑𝑉 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑄 2𝜋𝜀0𝑥2 ! But E should = 0 !! 5 L Q Q x x Extra Example by Request • By considering the point in the middle we have fixed x to L/2 i.e. made x a constant hence 𝑑𝑉 𝑑𝑥 = 0 • Instead, consider more general problem of potential a distance x from LHS charge. • Let’s do this on the visualizer. 6 L Q Q x L- x Electric Dipoles 7 a +q -q p An Electric Dipole Define dipole moment as 𝒑 = 𝑞𝒂 The vector of p is drawn from the negative to the positive point charge p is a vector. Natural Dipoles • Many molecules form natural dipoles • Molecular example: H2O 8 The electric dipole of water makes it an excellent solvent (able to dissolve other substances) Used in heating food in a microwave oven (see later) p = 6.1 x 10-30 C m Calculation of the E-field at an arbitrary (r, ) 9 Potential due to Electric Dipole • V at P due to two charges: • 𝑉𝑝 = 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟+ − 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟− 10 a r+ r- r +q -q P  𝑉𝑝 = 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀0 1 𝑟+ − 1 𝑟−  a b c b2 = a2 + c2 – 2ac cos Any triangle (GCSE maths) Use 11 Potential due to Electric Dipole Potential at P is (q/40r+) + (-q/ 40r-) = q/40 [ (1/r+) - (1/r-) ] Now, r+ 2 = r2 + (a/2)2 – ar cos and r- 2 = r2 + (a/2)2 + ar cosa r+ r- r +q -q P  So, 1/r+ = (r+ 2)-1/2 = (r2[1 + a2/4r2 – (a/r)cos])-1/2 = (1/r) (1 + a2/4r2 – (a/r)cos)-1/2 = (1/r) (1 – (1/2)[a2/4r2 – (a/r)cos] + higher order terms) Remember: (1 + x)n = 1 + nx + n(n-1)x2/2! + …..
