This is a different approach from the one I used in Lecture 2. The displacement of a particle at the left end of the string is given by: OR, The displacement at point x at time t is the same as the displacement at x =0 at an earlier time “t-x/v”. The displacement at x =0 at time [t-x/v] is just Eq. 1 What is y(x, t) for x other than 0? The same displacement is found at x at a later time. How much later? x/v seconds later, because wave moves to the right with velocity v. Eq. 2 This is also the displacement at a point which has a distance x from the origin at time t. In our analysis, we have chosen an arbitrary time and an arbitrary distance, thus, Eq. 2 applies to any distance and time. Therefore, the general expression of a sinusoidal wave: is called the wave number. Hence, the wave function can be written as: The above wave function describes a sinusoidal wave travelling in the +x direction. For waves travelling in the –x direction, we have: In both cases, the quantity is called the phase. Adding a constant to the phase does not change the physical property of the wave Units: y in meters, A in meters, x in meters, k rad/m, w rad/s k and w are the two key parameters for waves. Wave velocity. Starting from the wave function: Rearrange: Particle velocity and acceleration in a sinusoidal wave In a transverse wave, the particles oscillate in directions perpendicular to the direction that the wave is moving. Now, Let’s find the transverse velocity of a particle, vy. vy is not the wave velocity! We can find vy using the wave function. We take the first derivative of the wave function with respect to t, keeping x constant. is a partial derivative. treating x as a constant. Since we have kept x fixed, the above equation hence shows the transverse velocity of a particle located at x. It also shows that the particle is a harmonic oscillator with a maximum speed wA. Is wA greater or smaller than the wave velocity?? The acceleration of a particle is the second partial derivative of the wave function y(x, t). Now let’s compute the partial derivatives of y(x, t) with respect to x, keeping t constant. Why? Divide Eq. i by Eq ii: The wave equation Any wave obeys this wave equation, no matter which direction the wave travels, or whether the wave is periodic or not! If y(x,t) does not satisfy this equation, then it is not a wave function.
