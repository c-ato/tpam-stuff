{"path":"Year 1/Chaos/Lecture/appendix2.pdf","text":"Appendix: Solving Algebraic Equations To ﬁnd the low order n-cycles exactly, we need to deal with algebraic equations. For the logistic map the 1-cycles are controlled by x1 = rx1(1 − x1) the 2-cycles by x2 = rx1(1 − x1) x1 = rx2(1 − x2) the 3-cycles by x2 = rx1(1 − x1) x3 = rx2(1 − x2) x1 = rx3(1 − x3) and the four cycles by x2 = rx1(1 − x1) x3 = rx2(1 − x2) x4 = rx3(1 − x3) x1 = rx4(1 − x4) Obviously the general n-cycle will involve n similar equations. The ﬁrst crucial piece of understanding is that the problem that we are trying to solve cannot distinguish between the points in the cycle, only the order of the points. If we were to start from x2, instead of x1, we would get the same system of equations. This means that we cannot target x1 above any of the other possible points and we need an approach that cannot distinguish between the points. The approach can distinguish the order however. The key area of mathematics is algebraic equations and in particular polynomial equations. The low order equations in terms of their roots are (z − x1) ≡ z − b1 (z − x1)(z − x2) = z2 − (x1 + x2)z + x1x2 ≡ z2 − b1z + b2 (z − x1)(z − x2)(z − x3) = z3 − (x1 + x2 + x3)z2 + (x2x3 + x3x1 + x1x2)z − x1x2x3 ≡ z3 − b1z2 + b2z − b3 (z − x1)(z − x2)(z − x3)(z − x4) = z4 − (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)z3 +(x2x3 + x3x4 + x4x1 + x1x2 + x2x4 + x3x1)z2 − (x2x3x4 + x3x4x1 + x4x1x2 + x1x2x3)z +x1x2x3x4 ≡ z4 − b1z3 + b2z2 − b3z + b4 These equations cannot distinguish which root is which and so we target the ﬁnding of these equations rather than trying to ﬁnd the roots themselves. If we can then solve these equations then we can ﬁnd the roots. The focus is now on the bm coeﬃcients. b1 is just the sum of the roots. b2 is the sum of the products of any and all pairs of roots. b3 is the sum of the products of any and all triples of roots...and so on. The details of the logistic map now take centre stage. For 1-cycles we have b1 = rb1(1 − b1) 1 a quadratic equation for b1 which we can solve to provide b1 = 0, 1 − 1 Before we solve this equation and analyse the 2-cycles, let us look at the second approach taking the diﬀerence of the two equations. Here we get b1 = 1 + 1 automatically provides an equation between up to triples of roots and so involves b1, b2 and b3. We get x2(x2 + x3) + x3(x3 + x1) + x1(x1 + x2) = r [(x2 + x3)x1(1 − x1) + (x3 + x1)x2(1 − x2) + (x1 + x2)x3(1 − x3)] ⇒ b2 1 − 2b2 + b2 = r [2b2 − b1b2 + 3b3] This idea would have worked for the previous 2-cycles, giving x2 2 + x2 1 = r [x2x1(1 − x1) + x1x2(1 − x2)] ⇒ b2 1 − 2b2 = r [2b2 − b2b1] and providing yet another way to solve the problem. For the 3-cycles we now have three equations in three unknowns and we can eliminate b2 and b3 using the ﬁrst two equations in the third −b2 1 + b2(1 + 2r − rb1) + 3rb3 = −b2 1 − 3rb1 + b2(1 + 5r − rb1) + 3r(b3 − b2 + b1) = −b2 1 − 3rb1 + 1 If we assume that we do not have any 2-cycles but only 4-cycles then we have [x1 + x3 − 1] [x2 + x4 − 1] = − 1 ⇒ ¯zn − b1 ¯zn−1 + b2 ¯zn−2 + .... ± bn = 0 where ¯a is the complex-conjugate of a. Clearly if z is a solution then so is ¯z. If z=¯z we have a real solution otherwise we have a complex-conjugate pair. The only way for a pair of complex-conjugate solutions to smoothly become real solutions, as a parameter is varied, is for them to merge providing a double root which can then separate into two distinct real roots. The quantity that vanishes when two roots merge is known as the discriminant. To ﬁnd the discriminant we may use the idea that P (z) = (z − λ)2Q(z) where λ is the double root and then dP [ b2 1b2 + 3b1b3 − 4b2 2] z − 2b3(b2 1 − 3b2) = 0 [ b2 1b2 + 3b1b3 − 4b2 2] (b1b2 − 9b3) − 2(b2 1 − 3b2)2b3(b2 1 − 3b2) = 0 b3 1b2 2 − 9b2 1b2b3 + 3b2 1b2b3 − 27b1b3 2 − 4b1b3 2 + 36b2 2b3 − 4b4 1b3 + 24b2 1b2b3 − 36b2 2b3 = 0 and so D3 ≡ b2 1b2 2 + 18b1b2b3 − 27b2 3 − 4b3 2 − 4b3 1b3 This calculation only needs to be done once and we could have calculated directly using D3 ≡ (x2 − x3)2(x3 − x1)2(x1 − x2)2 = [x2 1x3 + x2 2x1 + x2 3x2 − x2 1x2 − x2 2x3 − x2 3x1]2 = [ x2 1x3 + x2 2x1 + x2 3x2 + x2 1x2 + x2 2x3 + x2 3x1]2 −4 (x4 1x2x3 + x4 2x3x1 + x4 3x1x2 + x3 2x3 3 + x3 3x3 1 + x3 1x3 2 + 3x2 1x2 2x2 3) The sequence of identities (x2x3 + x3x1 + x1x2)3 = x3 2x3 3 + x3 3x3 1 + x3 1x3 2 + 6x2 1x2 2x2 3 +3 [ x2 2x2 3(x2 + x3)x1 + x2 3x2 1(x3 + x1)x2 + x2 1x2 2(x1 + x2)x3] which leads to x3 2x3 3 + x3 3x3 1 + x3 1x3 2 = b3 2 − 6b2 3 − 3b3 [b1b2 − 3b3] x3 1 + x3 2 + x3 3 = b1(x2 1 + x2 2 + x2 3) − b2(x1 + x2 + x3) + 3b3 = b3 1 − 3b1b2 + 3b3 leads to D3 = [b1b2 − 3b3] 2 − 4 ( b3 [b3 1 − 3b1b2 + 3b3] + b3 2 − 3b1b2b3 + 9b2 3 − 6b2 3 + 3b2 3) = b2 1b2 2 + 18b1b2b3 − 27b2 3 − 4b3 1b3 − 4b3 2 the same as the derivative method. We can now employ this quantity to determine when two of the 4-cycles become complex b1 = 0 b2 = 3 marks the appearence of a pair of 4-cycles which only exist when r ≥ r4 and when r ≤ 2 − r4. Once we have solved the cubic, and found values for b1, then we can solve the quadratic (y − y1)(y − y2) = y2 − (b1 − 2)y − 1 together with the quadratic equation which controls b1 b2 1 − (3 + 1 + 4","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
