Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. No calculator is permitted in this examination. Page 1 Turn over No Calculator Section A 1. (a) For the vectors a = (1, 2, 4), b = (v1, v2, v3) and c = (1, 2, 3) determine (i) a + b; (ii) a · b; (iii) a × b; and (iv) the angle θ between a and c (you may leave your answer in the form θ = cos−1(x) or sin −1(x) where x is a number you have determined).
