In the circuit shown below: (a) What is the initial battery current immediately after the switch is closed? (b) What is the battery current a long time after the switch is closed? (c) What is the maximum voltage across the capacitor? (d) If the switch has been closed for a long time and is then opened, deduce an expression for the current through the 600 k resistor as a function of time. (e) What is the energy dissipated in the 600 k resistor after the switch is opened? (Note that 1 k = 103 ; 1 M = 10 6 ; 1 F = 10--6 F.) Solution 1. (a) Initially, the capacitor acts like a short-circuit, bypassing the 600 kΩ resistor. I = V/R = 50 V/ 1.2MΩ = 41.7 μA (b) A long time after the switch is closed, the capacitor is fully charged and acts like an open-circuit. I = V/R = 50 V/ (1.2 + 0.6)MΩ = 50 V/1.8MΩ = 27.8 μA (c) At this stage, the potential difference across the capacitor is 50 V x 0.6/1.8 = 16.7 V, by the potential divider rule. (d) Total response = Final Value + (Initial Value – Final Value) e-t/τ The final value of the current will be zero, as the capacitor is discharging. The total response is therefore, I = I0e-t/RC, where I0 = V/R = 16.7 V / 600 kΩ = 27.8 μA and τ=RC= 1.5 s. (e) The energy dissipated is equal to the energy stored in the capacitor. E = 1/2 CV2 = 0.5 ( 2.5 x 10-6 x (16.7)2 )= 3.5 x 10-4 Joules. 50 V 1.2 M Ω 2.5 μF 600 k Ω + –","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
