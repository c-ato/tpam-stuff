A long straight cylindrical conductor has an outer radius b and a hollow core of radius a. The ﬁgure below shows the cross-sectional view of this conductor. There is an electrical current ﬂowing in the direction perpendicular to the cross-section. The current density varies with radius r, for a ≤ r ≤ b as j(r) = j0 r a , where j0 is constant. 1. Find an expression for the total current ﬂowing in the conductor. [2] 2. Find an expression for the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in the three regions: (a) r < a; [1] (b) a ≤ r ≤ b; [1] (c) r > b; [1] Problem 2. A thin, uniform rod with negligible mass and length L = 0.2 m is attached to the ﬂoor by a frictionless hinge at point P. A horizontal spring with force constant k = 4.8 N m −1 connects the other end of the rod to a vertical wall. The rod is in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B = 0.34 T directed into the plane of the ﬁgure. There is a current I = 6.5A in the rod in the direction shown. 1. Calculate the torque τB due to the force induced by the magnetic ﬁeld, for an axis at P. Does the torque tend to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise the rod? [2] 2. At equilibrium, the rod makes an angle of 53◦ with respect to the ﬂoor (see ﬁgure): how much energy is stored in the spring? [3]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
