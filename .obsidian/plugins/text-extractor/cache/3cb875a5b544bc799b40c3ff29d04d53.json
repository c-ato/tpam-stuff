Recall the following definition from the lectures: Definition. A sequence of real numbers (an) tends to infinity if given any real number A > 0 there exists N ∈ N such that an > A for all n > N. (i) Using the definition prove that the sequence (an) given by an = √n tends to infinity. (ii) Using the definition prove that the sequence (bn) given by bn = n4 + n2 + 4 3n3 + 2n + 1 tends to infinity. Solution. (i) Let A > 0. Observe that √n > A whenever n > A 2. Choosing N ∈ N such that N ≥ A2 we have an = √n > √N ≥ √A2 = A whenever n > N . (ii) We observe 1 first that bn = n4 + n2 + 4 3n3 + 2n + 1 ≥ n4 3n3 + 2n + 1 ≥ n4 3n3 + 2n3 + n3 = n 4 6n3 = n 6 for all n ∈ N. Now let A > 0 and choose N ∈ N such that N ≥ 6A. With this choice of N , bn ≥ n 6 > N 6 ≥ 6A 6 = A whenever n > N . □ Q2. Recall the following definition from the lectures: Definition. A sequence (an) of real numbers converges to a real number ℓ if given any ε > 0 there exists N ∈ N such that |an − ℓ| < ε for all n > N. A sequence (an) converges if it converges to ℓ for some real number ℓ. 1As is very often the case, there are many similar observations that one could make here. It doesn’t matter what the choice of N is as long as it works (and is justified properly). Here we are invoking elementary inequalities on the numerators and denominators separately based on the fact that n ∈ N – typically that n is positive, or that n ≥ 1 specifically. What guides us is the desire to reach an expression that’s simple enough for a suitable N to be chosen by inspection. 1 2 (i) Using the definition prove that the sequence (an) given by an = n + 2 n + 1 converges to 1. (ii) Using the definition prove that the sequence (bn) given by bn = n + (−1)n 2n + (−1)n converges. Solution. (i) Observe that |an − 1| = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n + 2 n + 1 − 1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = 1 n + 1 ≤ 1 n for all n ∈ N. Now let ε > 0 and choose N ∈ N such that N ≥ 1 ε . With this choice of N , |an − 1| ≤ 1 n < 1 N ≤ 1 1/ε = ε whenever n > N . (ii) Observe that ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣bn − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n + (−1) n 2n + (−1)n − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ (−1)n 2(2n + (−1)n) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ 1 2(2n − 1) ≤ 1 2(2n − n) = 1 2n for all n ∈ N. Now let ε > 0 and choose N ∈ N such that N ≥ 1 2ε . With this choice of N , ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣bn − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ 1 2n < 1 2N ≤ 1 2( 1 2ε ) = ε whenever n > N . [Remark. I could have left my intial observation above as ∣ ∣bn − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ≤ 1 2(2n−1) , and taken N ∈ N such that N ≥ 1 2 (1 + 1 2ε ). I decided to go a bit further with my estimations in order to make the expressions a little simpler.] □ Q3. Prove (using the definition) that the sequence (an) tends to infinity in each of the following cases: (i) an = n 1/4; (ii) an = n4+4n3+1 n3+2 ; (iii) an = (2 + (−1)n)n; (iv) an = (n + 1 n )3 − n3. Solution. (i) Let A > 0 and choose N to be any natural number at least as large as A4. With this choice of N , an = n1/4 > N 1/4 ≥ (A4)1/4 = A whenever n > N . (ii) We begin by observing that n4 + 4n 3 + 1 n3 + 2 ≥ n4 n3 + 2 ≥ n4 n3 + 2n3 = n 3 for all n ∈ N. Let A > 0 and choose N to be any natural number at least as large as 3A. With this choice of N , an = n4 + 4n3 + 1 n3 + 2 ≥ n 3 > N 3 ≥ 3A 3 = A, whenever n > N . (iii) Observe that an = (2 + (−1)n)n ≥ (2 − 1)n = n 3 for all n ∈ N. Let A > 0 and choose N to be any natural number at least as large as A. With this choice of N , an ≥ n > N ≥ A whenever n > N . (iv) Observe that an = n3 + 3n + 3 n + 1 n3 − n3 ≥ 3n for all n ∈ N. Let A > 0 and choose N to be any natural number at least as large as A 3 . With this choice of N , an ≥ 3n > 3N ≥ 3 ( A 3 ) = A whenever n > N . □ Q4. For each of the following sequences (an) and values of ℓ, prove (using the definition) that an → ℓ: (i) an = 1+(−1)n n , ℓ = 0; (ii) an = n2+4 sin(n) 2n2+3 , ℓ = 1 2 . Solution. (i) We begin by observing that |an − 0| = 1 + (−1)n n ≤ 2 n for all n ∈ N. Now let ε > 0 and choose N ∈ N to be at least as large as 2/ε. With this choice of N , |an − 0| ≤ 2 n < 2 N ≤ 2 2/ε = ε whenever n > N . (ii) We begin by observing that ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣an − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n2 + 4 sin(n) 2n2 + 3 − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 8 sin(n) − 3 2(2n2 + 3) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ 11 2(2n2 + 3) ≤ 11 4n2 for all n ∈ N. Here we have used the fact that | sin x| ≤ 1 for real numbers x, along with the triangle inequality to establish that |8 sin(n) − 3| ≤ 8| sin(n)| + | − 3| ≤ 11. Now let ε > 0 and choose N ∈ N to be at least as large as √ 11 4ε . With this choice of N , |an − 1 2 | ≤ 11 4n2 < 11 4N 2 < ε whenever n > N . □ Q5. (i) Prove that if x, y > 0 then √x − √y = x − y √x + √y . (ii) Using the definition of convergence, prove that the sequence (an) given by an = √n + 1 − √n converges to 0. 4 (iii) Does the sequence (bn) given by bn = √n2 + n − n converge? If so, what does it converge to? Justify your assertions. Solution. (i) Observe that (√x − √y)( √x + √y) = x − y (here we’re using the elementary factorisation of the “difference of two squares” a 2 − b2 = (a − b)(a + b)). Dividing through by the non-zero quantity √x + √y leads to the required identity. (ii) Applying the identity in Part (i), we have an = 1 √n + 1 + √n , so that |an − 0| = 1 √n + 1 + √n ≤ 1 √n for all n ∈ N. Now let ε > 0 and choose N ∈ N to be at least as large as 1/ε2. With this choice of N , |an − 0| ≤ 1 √n < 1 √N ≤ 1 √ 1/ε2 = ε whenever n > N . (iii) By Part (i), bn = √n2 + n − n = √n2 + n − √n2 = n2 + n − n2 √n2 + n + n = n √n2 + n + n . We claim that bn → 1 2 . To show this we write ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣bn − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n √n2 + n + n − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ n − √n2 + n 2(√n2 + n + n) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = √n2 + n − n 2(√n2 + n + n) , where we recognise bn appearing as the numerator. Substituting our first observa- tion into this last expression we obtain ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣bn − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = n 2( √n2 + n + n)2 , and so ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣bn − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = n 2(√n2 + n + n)2 ≤ n 2n2 = 1 2n for all n ∈ N. Now let ε > 0 and choose N ∈ N to be at least as large as 1 2ε . With this choice of N we have ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣bn − 1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ 1 2n < 1 2N ≤ ε 5 whenever n > N . This proves our claim. □ Extra Questions These are some additional questions that you may find helpful, either now or at a later date. EQ1. Consider the sequence 1, − 1 2 , 1 3 , − 1 4 , 1 5 , · · · , which has nth term an = (−1) n+1 n . (i) Find a natural number N for which an ∈ (− 1 10 , 1 10 ) for all n > N . [Here (− 1 10 , 1 10 ) denotes the interval {x ∈ R : − 1 10 < x < 1 10 }.] (ii) Find a natural number N for which an ∈ (− 1 1000 , 1 1000 ) for all n > N . (iii) Let ε be any positive real number. Find a natural number N for which an ∈ (−ε, ε) for all n > N . What does this prove? Solution. Omitted. □ EQ2. Let the sequence (an) be given by an = n∑ k=1 1 √n + k . (i) Show that an ≥ √ n 2 for all n ∈ N. (ii) By appealing to the appropriate definition, deduce that an → ∞. Solution. (i) One might reasonably try to argue by induction here, although I expect it is simpler to argue as follows: Since 1 √n + k ≥ 1 √n + n = 1 √2n for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n, an = n∑ k=1 1 √n + k ≥ n∑ k=1 1 √2n = n √2n = √ n 2 . (ii) Let A > 0 and choose N ∈ N such that N ≥ 2A2. With this choice of N , an ≥ √ n 2 > √ N 2 ≥ √ 2A2 2 = A whenever n > N . □ EQ3. Suppose that ℓ > 0 and that an → ℓ. Prove that there exists N ∈ N such that an > 0 for all n > N . Solution. Since an → ℓ, by the definition applied with ε = ℓ/2 > 0, there exists N ∈ N such that |an − ℓ| < ℓ/2 whenever n > N . In other words, −ℓ/2 < an − ℓ < ℓ/2 whenever n > N . In particular, by the first of these two inequalities, we have that an > ℓ/2 whenever n > N . Since ℓ > 0, the desired conclusion follows. □ EQ4. Prove that if an → ∞ and bn → ∞ then (a) an + bn → ∞, and (b) anbn → ∞. 6 Solution. (i) Let A > 0. Since an → ∞ there exists N1 ∈ N such that (†) an > A 2 for all n > N1. Since bn → ∞ there exists N2 ∈ N such that (††) bn > A 2 for all n > N2. Let N = max{N1, N2}. Since N ≥ N1 and N ≥ N2, on combining (†) and (††) we obtain an + bn > A 2 + A 2 = A for all n > N. Since A was arbitrary, we conclude that an + bn → ∞ as n → ∞. (ii) Let A > 0. Since an → ∞ there exists N1 ∈ N such that (†) an > √A; for all n > N1. Since bn → ∞ there exists N2 ∈ N such that (††) bn > √A for all n > N2. Let N = max{N1, N2}. Since N ≥ N1 and N ≥ N2, on combining (†) and (††) we obtain anbn > √A√A = A for all n > N. Since A was arbitrary, we conclude that anbn → ∞ as n → ∞. □ EQ5. Suppose that N0 ∈ N and that an ≥ bn for all n > N0. Prove that if bn → ∞ then an → ∞. Solution. Let A > 0. Since bn → ∞ there exists N ′ ∈ N such that bn > A for all n > N ′. Now let N = max{N ′, N0} and observe that by the hypotheses of the theorem, an ≥ bn > A for all n > N. Hence an → ∞. □ EQ6. Give explicit examples of sequences (an) and (bn), satisfying an → ∞ and bn → 0, for which (i) anbn → 1. (ii) anbn → 0. (iii) anbn → ∞. (iv) anbn → −∞. (v) the sequence (anbn) neither converges nor tends to ±∞. (vi) bn > 0 for all n ∈ N, and the sequence (anbn) neither converges nor tends to ±∞. [Here (anbn) is the sequence whose nth term is the product anbn.] Solution. Omitted. □ EQ7. Give explicit examples of sequences (an) and (bn), satisfying an → ∞ and bn → ∞, for which (i) an − bn → 0, (ii) an − bn → 1, (iii) an − bn → ∞, (iv) an − bn → −∞, 7 (v) the sequence (an − bn) neither converges nor tends to ±∞. [Here (an − bn) is the sequence whose nth term is the difference an − bn.] Solution. (i) For example, take an = n and bn = n. (ii) For example, take an = n + 1 and bn = n. (iii) For example, take an = 2n and bn = n. (iv) For example, take an = n and bn = 2n. (v) For example, take an = n + (−1) n and bn = n. □ EQ8. Suppose that (an) is a sequence of positive real numbers converging to ℓ > 0. (i) Prove that |√ an − √ℓ| ≤ |an − ℓ| √ℓ for all n ∈ N. (ii) Using Part (i), or otherwise, prove that √an → √ℓ as n → ∞. (iii) Deduce that √n4 + 4n n2 + 1 → 1, justifying any assertions that you make. Solution. (i) We first observe the identity √an − √ℓ = an − ℓ √an + √ℓ . (This is a direct application of the formula (x − y)(x + y) = x 2 − y2 where x = √an and y = √ℓ.) Hence, in particular |√an − √ℓ| = |an − ℓ| √an + √ℓ . Since √an + √ℓ ≥ √ℓ, we have that | √an − √ℓ| ≤ |an − ℓ| √ℓ for all n ∈ N. (ii) Let ε > 0 be arbitrary. Since an → ℓ and ℓ > 0, there exists N ∈ N such that |an − ℓ| < ε √ℓ for all n > N. Hence by Part (i), | √an − √ℓ| < ε√ℓ √ℓ = ε for all n > N. Hence √an → ℓ, as required. (iii) Observe that √n4 + 4n n2 + 1 = √ n4 + 4n n4 + 2n2 + 1 . By Part (ii), it will suffice to show that n4 + 4n n4 + 2n2 + 1 → 1. We leave the details of this to the reader, being similar to some of the earlier exercises. 8 □ EQ9. (i) For which values of n ∈ N is it true that 2n ≥ n? Prove your assertion. Using your result, or otherwise, prove that 2 n → ∞. (ii) For which values of n ∈ N is it true that 2n ≥ n2? Prove your assertion. Using your result, or otherwise, prove that 2 n n → ∞. (iii) Outline a potential strategy for proving that 2 n nk → ∞ for all k = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .. Solution. (i) Claim: 2 n ≥ n for all n ∈ N. To see this we argue by induction. Since 21 = 2 ≥ 1, the claimed inequality is true for n = 1 (this is the base case for the induction). Suppose now that 2k ≥ k holds for some k ∈ N (this is the inductive hypothesis). Now, 2 k+1 = 2.2k ≥ 2k, by the inductive hypothesis. However, since k ≥ 1 we have that 2k ≥ k + 1, and so 2k+1 ≥ k + 1. Hence 2n ≥ n holds for n = k + 1. Our claim now follows by the principle of mathematical induction. It just remains to show that 2n → ∞. To this end let A > 0 and choose N to be any natural number greater than A. With this choice of N , 2n ≥ n > N > A whenever n > N . Since A was arbitrary, we conclude that 2 n → ∞. (ii) Claim: 2n ≥ n2 for all natural numbers n ̸= 3. For n = 1 and n = 2 we may verify the inequality directly since 21 = 2 ≥ 1 = 1 2 and 2 2 = 4 ≥ 4 = 2 2. For n = 3 it fails since 23 = 8 < 9 = 3 2. In order to prove that 2 n ≥ n2 holds for n ≥ 4, we argue by induction. Since 24 = 16 ≥ 16 = 42, the claimed inequality is true for n = 4 (this is the base case for the induction). Suppose now that 2 k ≥ k2 holds for some k ≥ 4 (this is the inductive hypothesis). Now, 2k+1 = 2.2 k ≥ 2k2, by the inductive hypothesis. In order to complete the inductive step, it remains to show that 2k2 ≥ (k + 1)2. To this end consider 2k2 − (k + 1)2 = k2 − 2k − 1. Since k ≥ 4 we have k2 = k.k ≥ 4k, so that 2k2 − (k + 1)2 ≥ 4k − 2k − 1 = 2k − 1 ≥ 0, as required. Hence 2k+1 ≥ (k + 1)2, completing the inductive step. Therefore 2n ≥ n2 for all n ≥ 4 by the principle of mathematical induction. 9 Finally let’s use this inequality to show that 2 n n → ∞. Let A > 0 and choose N to be any natural number greater than max{4, A}. With this choice of N we have 2n n ≥ n2 n = n > N > A whenever n > N . Since A was arbitrary, we conclude that 2 n n → ∞. (iii) We do not provide solutions to this part. □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
