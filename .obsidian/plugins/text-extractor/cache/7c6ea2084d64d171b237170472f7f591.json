Determine the following limits and prove that your answer is correct by directly appealing to the definition of the limit. (a) lim x→10 2x + 3. (b) lim x→−7 −6x − 2. Make sure to check out Question 2 in Problem Sheet 1 for similar questions and a guide on how to write proofs. (SUM) Q2. In this question, you may use the Algebra of Limits. You should not need to use L’Hôpital’s rule. (a) Evaluate the limit lim h→0 2(−3 + h) 2 − 18 h . (b) Evaluate the limit lim t→4 t − √3t + 4 4 − t . (c) Evaluate lim x→2 √3x − 2 − √5x − 6 √2x − 1 − √x + 1 . Make sure to check out Questions 8 and EQ2 in Practice Problem Sheet 1 for similar questions and a guide on how to write proofs. (SUM) Q3. Let a, b, c ∈ R. Let f : R → R be the polynomial f (x) = x3 + ax2 + bx + c. (i) Prove that lim x→−∞ f (x) = −∞ and lim x→∞ f (x) = ∞. (ii) Prove that there exist x1, x2 ∈ R such that f (x1) < 0 and f (x2) > 0. [Hint: definition of limit. Also, check out Question 6 in Practice Problem Sheet 1 for a similar argument.] (iii) Prove that there exists x0 ∈ R such that f (x0) = 0, i.e. f has at least one zero x0 in R. [Note: This shows that every polynomial of degree 3 has a zero in R. A similar argument proves that every polynomial of odd degree has a zero in R; in turn, this fact can be used as a starting point for a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.] 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
