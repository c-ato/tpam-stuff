The resulting expression has dimensions of energy and for small velocities behaves as m(v)c 2 = mc2 √ 1 − v2/c2 ≃ mc2 ( 1 + 1 2 v2 c2 ) = mc 2 + mv2 2 as v/c → 0 . One recognises the velocity-dependent term as simply the kinetic energy of a free particle. This non-relativistic expression comes as an addition to the constant mc2 familiar from the popular science. Being independent of velocity this term does not play any role in non- relativistic physics and can be simply considered as the level from which kinetic energy is measured (i.e. set to zero). The fact that we found these two terms in the small velocity expansion of the relativistic mass (times c2) is not a coincidence, but rather a deep statement of energy-mass equivalence in relativistic physics. The total kinetic energy, including the rest energy mc2 is therefore E(v) = m(v)c 2 = γ(v)mc 2 = mc2 √1 − v2/c2 . The equivalence of mass and energy encoded in the expression E = mc2 is used in physics to measure (rest) mass of elementary particles in energy units. Take, for example an electron with (rest) mass me ≃ 9 × 10 −31kg . The corresponding energy is mec2 ≃ 9 × 32 × 10−31 × 1016J ≃ 8.1 × 10−14J. Joules are too big as an energy unit for elementary particles. Instead one measures energy in units of electron- volts (eV), i.e. the energy gained by an electron with charge e = 1.6 × 10−19Coulomb in a potential diﬀerence of one Volt. This corresponds to 1.6 × 10−19J and the mass of electron expressed in these units is me = 8 × 10−14J 1.6 × 10−19J/eV = 5 × 10 5eV = 0.5MeV . Similarly, a proton which is about 2000 times heavier than electron has its rest mass mp = 939.6MeV. Energy-momentum relation in relativistic mechanics In many situations in physics kinetic energy should be considered as a function of momentum and not velocity. This is crucial, for example, in Quantum Mechanics, where momentum corresponds to de Broglie wavelength of a particle, p = h/λ, where h = 6.6 × 10−34J · s is the Planck constant. In Newtonian mechanics the energy - momentum relation is obtained by expressing v = p/m and substituting into E = mv2/2 = p2/2m. In relativistic mechanics one can do the same thing, but the relation between momentum and velocity is more complicated. Instead we can make a short cut by taking squares, E2 c2 = m2c2 1 − v2/c2 , p 2 = m2v2 1 − v2/c2 ⇒ E2 c2 − p 2 = m 2c 2 1 − v2/c2 1 − v2/c2 = m 2c 2 DM Gangardt 1 University of Birmingham SR Lecture 09 Energy and energy-momentum relation in relativistic mechanics and the energy-momentum relation is E = √ m2c4 − p2c2 . This relation is particularly useful for massless particles, like photon. Being a particle of light photon moves with speed of light and expressions for energy and momentum in terms of velocity are ill-deﬁned as the denominator becomes zero. On the other hand, the photon mass is also zero, so its energy and momentum are still deﬁned. Taking m → 0 in the energy-momentum relation above is well deﬁned as well and leads to E = c|p| . This expression is valid exactly for massless particles. For massive particles moving with velocities close to speed of light this is a ’ultra-relativistic approximation’ valid for momenta p ≫ mc (’ultra-relativisitic limit). This is a good approximation for neutrinos which until recently were believed to have zero mass. In the opposite, non-relativistic limit p ≪ mc the energy momentum relation is E ≃ mc2 + p2/2m, as expected. Using energy and momentum conservation for solving simple dynamical relativistic problems. Consider decay of a particle with rest mass m1 into another particle with mass m2 < m1 and a neutrino which can be assumed massless, see Fig . We want to calculate velocity of the particle after decay in the rest frame where the initial particle was at rest. Figure 1: Decay of heavy particle. We work in the frame where the decaying particle is at rest, so the total energy is Ei = m1c2 and the total momentum is zero, pi = 0. After the decay the total momentum is given by the momentum of the neutrino, p, and the momentum of the light particle moving with velocity −v, pf = p − m2v √ 1 − v2/c2 . The ﬁnal energy is a sum of the energy of the moving particle and the energy cp of the neutrino, Ef = m2c2 √ 1 − v2/c2 + cp . From the conservation of momentum, pf = pi = 0 we obtain p = m2v/ √1 − v2/c2 and substituting this relation into conservation of energy, Ef = Ei we get m1c 2 = m2c2 √ 1 − v2/c2 (1 + v/c) = m2 √ 1 + v/c 1 − v/c . Solving for v/c we obtain v/c = m2 1 − m2 2 m2 1 + m2 2 . In this example a fraction of the rest energy m1c2 is transformed into kinetic energy of the moving particle and the neutrino.
