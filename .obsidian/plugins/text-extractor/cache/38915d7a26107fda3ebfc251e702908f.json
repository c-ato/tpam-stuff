All images are formed by reflection, or refraction, or a combination of both. Light is treated as straight rays, hence “Ray optics”; or Geometric optics because everything can be solved using geometry and trigonometry. Object: Anything from which light rays radiate: A candle, a light bulb, a star, or a person (not in complete darkness). Point object: A single point. Extended object: More than just a single point. A star that is far away can be treated as a point object. Mirror image of a point object Plane Mirrors P P’ All reflected rays appear to come from P’. P P’ V A q q q s s’ The two triangles PVA and P’VA are congruent, so s and s’ have the same magnitude. P’ is the image of object P. P’ is a virtual image because there is NOT light coming from P’. s=PV, is called the object distance. s’=P’V, is called the image distance. s s’ y y’ P P’ ray diagram Image formation by reflection s, the object distance, s’ the image distance. y, height of object y’, height of image. Lateral magnification, m=y’/y m=1 for plane mirror Mirror image of an extended object Mirror Sign Rules s s’ y y’ P P’ ray diagram Mirror Sign Rules 1. For object distance: When the object is on the same side of the reflecting surface as the incoming light, the object distance s is positive; otherwise, it is negative. 3. Radius of curvature of the mirror. When the centre of curvature C is on the same side as the outgoing light, the radius of curvature is positive. 2. For the image distance: When the image is on the same side of the reflecting surface as the outgoing light, the image distance s’ is positive. For a mirror, the incoming and outgoing light are always on the same side. For a plane mirror, radius of curvature is infinite. Rule 3 above is useful for curved mirrors described later. s s’ y y’ P P’ For a plane mirror, the object is on the same side of the incoming ray, so s is positive. The image is NOT on the same side of the outgoing ray, so s’ is negative. s = -s’ The image arrow points in the same direction as the object arrow, the image is erect/upright. If they point in opposite directions, then the image is inverted, and lateral magnification becomes negative. The image is the same height as that of the object, hence magnification is +1. Image formed by a mirror is reversed: back to front. reversed Non-reversed Mirror Image formed by a plane mirror is: Virtual, erect, reversed. http://angelgilding.com/Multiple_Reflections.html Angled Mirrors 1 2 3 4 5 6 Angled Mirrors Get multiple images For double reflection, it is equivalent to: Placing P at the position of P’ and removing Mirror 1!How many images are there?
