Model solutions will only be released for the Assignment Question AQ1 and Questions Q1-Q4. Important: Late submissions will be penalised at a rate of 5% per day late up until exactly two days after the submission deadline, at which point the model solutions will be released and the Assignment will be closed to further submissions on Canvas. Your Assignment Question solutions must be submitted as a single PDF file. You may upload newer versions, BUT only the most recent upload will be viewed and graded. In particular, this means that subsequent uploads will need to contain ALL of your work, not just the parts which have changed. Moreover, if you upload a new version after the deadline, then your submission will be counted as late and the late penalty will be applied REGARDLESS of whether an older version was submitted before the deadline. In the interest of fairness to all students and staff, there will be no exceptions to these rules. All of this and more is explained in detail on the Submission of Continuous Assessment page in the Student Handbook on Canvas. 1 2 Assignment Question AQ1.

Find the value of the following improper integrals or prove that they are divergent: (a) ∫ 1 0 x log(x) dx (b) ∫ 10 0 x x − 5 dx (c) ∫ 0 − π 2 sec(x) dx 4 Extra Questions EQ1. A cylindrical water tank is mounted sideways, so it has a circular vertical cross-section. The tank is 10 meters in diameter. Calculate the percentage of the tank’s capacity that is filled when the height of the water in the tank is 6 meters. (a) Calculate the percentage of the tank’s capacity that is filled with water when the height of the water in the tank is 6 meters. (b) Calculate the height of the water in the tank when it is at 33% capacity. EQ2. (a) For each n ∈ N ∪ {0}, suppose that Tn(x) = ∫ tann(4x) dx: (i) Prove that Tn(x) = tan n−1(4x) 4(n − 1) − Tn−2(x) for all x ∈ (− π 8 , π 8 ) and all integers n > 2. (ii) Use the reduction formula above to find ∫ tan 3(4x) dx. (b) Find the following antiderivatives or integrals: (i) ∫ tan5(x) sec 6(x) dx (ii) ∫ π/4 0 cos2(6x) sin 2(6x) dx (iii) ∫ x 2 + 5x − 4 x3 − x dx EQ3. A bounded function f : R → R is integrable if there exists a ∈ R such that both ∫ a −∞ f and ∫ ∞ a f are convergent and finite, in which case ∫ ∞ −∞ f := ∫ a −∞ f + ∫ ∞ a f . (a) Use the properties of integrals to prove that the value of ∫ ∞ −∞ f does not depend on the value of a in this definition. (In other words, you need to prove that ∫ a −∞ f + ∫ ∞ a f = ∫ b −∞ f + ∫ ∞ b f for all a, b ∈ R whenever each side is defined.) (b) Prove that f : R → R given by f (x) := (1 + x 2) −1 for all x ∈ R is integrable and calculate the value of ∫ ∞ −∞ f . (c) Prove that g : [1, ∞) → R given by g(x) := e−x(4x2 + 3x) −1 for all x ∈ [1, ∞) is integrable. EQ4. Find all real numbers p such that the following properties hold: (a) The integral ∫ 1 0 xp dx is an improper integral. (b) The improper integral ∫ 1 0 xp dx is convergent.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
