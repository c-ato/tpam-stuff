(b) Using Thévenin’s theorem. 3 Ω A B 2 Ω + −10 V + − 5 V I Remove the 1  resistor and find the open circuit voltage VAB. To do this, you first need to find the current. You can use Kirchhoff’s voltage law to do this (or by inspection). 10−2I−3I−5=0 I =1A( clockwise ) Now use Kirchhoff’s voltage law to travel from A to B (either clockwise or anticlockwise) counting the potential rises and drops (and taking into account the direction of the current). Designating the potential at A as VA and the potential at B as VB, and going clockwise from A to B gives V A−3I−5=V B V A−V B=8V Point A is 8 V higher in potential than point B. (Crosscheck: in part (a) we assumed I3 flowed from A to B and since we found I3 was positive, this tells us that point A is at a higher potential than point B.) Therefore the Thévenin’s equivalent voltage is 8 V. The resistance looking back into the terminals A and B is given by the parallel combination of the 2 and 3 resistors = 6/5. (If this isn’t completely obvious, consider what would happen if you injected some current at A when the other sources were switched off. The circuit provides two independent paths for charge to flow from A to B, one through the 2 resistor and one through the 3 resistor. Since a single charge carrier cannot flow through both resistors, the resistors must be in parallel,) A B 6/5 Ω + −8 V By adding the 1 resistor to the Thévenin equivalent circuit, the current is found by taking the ratio of the voltage to the total resistance: I =V R = 8 11/ 5 =40 11 =3. 64 A","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
