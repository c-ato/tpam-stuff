Examples: The number of heads when tossing a coin The outcome of a die Introduction to Probability Probability Mass Functions (PMF) If we have a variable 𝑥 then the probability of observing 𝑥 is written 𝑃(𝑥) Introduction to Probability When the outcomes are numerical, we can place them on an axis and sketch out 𝑃(𝑥) 𝑥1 𝑥2 𝑥3 𝑃(𝑥) Normalisation We can normalise 𝑃(𝑥) through summation ෍ 𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) = 1 Introduction to Probability If 𝑃 𝑥 = 𝛼𝑓 𝑥 Then ෍ 𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) = 1 = 𝛼 ෍ 𝑥 𝑓(𝑥) 𝛼 = 1 σ𝑥 𝑓(𝑥) In statistical physics 𝛼 is called the partition function Example Normalise the following PMF 𝑃 𝑥 ∝ ቐ 𝑥 if 𝑥 = {1,2,3} 7 − 𝑥 if 𝑥 = {4,5,6} 0 otherwise Introduction to Probability x 1 2 3 4 5 6 Total F(x) 1 2 3 3 2 1 12 P(x) 1/12 1/6 1/4 1/4 1/6 1/12 1Cumulative Distribution Cumulative Distribution Probability that a variable is less than or equal to a certain value. Introduction to Probability 𝐶 𝑥 ≡ Prob 𝑋 ≤ 𝑥 = ෍ 𝑋≤𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) Die: 𝑃 𝑥 = 1 6 for 𝑥 = 1,2 … 6 x 1 2 3 4 5 6 P(x) 1/6 1/6 1/6 1/6 1/6 1/6 C(x) 1/6 2/6 3/6 4/6 5/6 1 Expectation Values Expectation Values The expectation value is defined by 𝑥 ≡ ෍ 𝑥 𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) It is a weighted sum of all the outcomes and is a measure of location. Introduction to Probability Warning 𝑥 ≡ ෍ 𝑥 𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) Is confusing because 𝑥 appears on both sides. You might prefer to write it has 𝑥 ≡ ෍ 𝑦 𝑦 𝑃(𝑦) But somehow this is just as confusing. Introduction to Probability Example Calculate ⟨𝑥⟩ for the following PMF Introduction to Probability 𝑥 ≡ ෍ 𝑥 𝑥 𝑃 𝑥 = 1 × 0.1 + 2 × 0.2 + 3 × 0.4 + 4 × 0.2 + 5 × 0.1 = 3 𝑥 1 2 3 4 5 𝑃(𝑥) 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.1 Example You play a game where you receive £𝑥’s for rolling an 𝑥 on a die. How much do you expect to win? Introduction to Probability 𝑥 ≡ ෍ 𝑥 𝑥 𝑃 𝑥 = 1 6 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 35 6 → £3.50 Expectation value of function Introduction to Probability In general: 𝑓 ≡ ෍ 𝑥 𝑓 𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) Again: a weighted sum over the values of 𝑥. 𝑐 = ෍ 𝑥 𝑐 𝑃 𝑥 = 𝑐 ෍ 𝑥 𝑃 𝑥 = 𝑐 Note 𝑥 = ⟨𝑥⟩ Linear Combinations Introduction to Probability 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏 = ෍ 𝑥 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏 𝑃 𝑥 = ෍ 𝑥 𝑎𝑥 𝑃 𝑥 + ෍ 𝑥 𝑏𝑃 𝑥 = 𝑎 ෍ 𝑥 𝑥 𝑃 𝑥 + 𝑏 ෍ 𝑥 𝑃 𝑥 = 𝑎⟨𝑥⟩ + 𝑏 Or we could have used 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏 = 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏 = 𝑎 𝑥 + 𝑏 Measure of Dispersion How often is 𝑥 far away from ⟨𝑥⟩? Introduction to Probability Spread What about expected deviation from 𝑥 ? 𝑥 − ⟨𝑥⟩ = 𝑥 − 𝑥 = 0 No good! |𝑥 − ⟨𝑥⟩| = MAD(𝑥) Is uncommon 𝑥 − 𝑥 2 = var 𝑥 = ෍ 𝑥 𝑥 − 𝑥 2 𝑃(𝑥) Variance and Standard Deviation Show var 𝑥 = 𝑥2 − 𝑥 2 Is a distance squared a good measure of spread?
