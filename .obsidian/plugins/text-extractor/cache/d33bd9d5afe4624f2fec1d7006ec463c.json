This kind of electric field exerts the usual forces on charges . • The unit for capacitance was named after Faraday 7 The Motion of a Conductor in a B Field • Electrons accumulate until FE = FB • Get an induced voltage  across the ends of the conductor 9             e-             v FB=evB FE=eE Conducting Rod length l- + B The Motion of a Conductor in a B Field • In equilibrium, E = vB • Potential difference induced, 𝜺 = 𝑬𝒍 = 𝒗𝑩𝒍 10             e-             v FB=evB FE=eE Length, l Sliding Rod in B-Field 11 The ends of the rod are in sliding contact with a pair of wires, a current will flow around the circuit The moving rod has become a source of electrical energy Sliding Rod in B-Field 12 Force on rod is: F = BIl To maintain motion at constant speed a force of equal magnitude must be applied in the direction of v - Rate of work = Fv = BIlv F Sliding Rod in B-Field 13 Rate of work done by electrical energy = I Conservation of Energy 𝐵I l v =  I Induced voltage 𝜺 = 𝑩𝒍𝒗 Note Induce voltage called Electro-motive force, e.m.f.

The flux change in time t is: 16 𝛿𝑚 = 𝐵𝑙𝑣 𝛿𝑡 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 = 𝐵𝑙𝑣 But induced voltage (e.m.f), 𝘀 = 𝐵𝑙𝑣 𝘀 = 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 Magnitude of induced voltage The Polarity of an Induced Voltage • The motion induces a voltage and hence a current in the metal ring. The current produces a magnetic field so that the ring behaves like a bar magnet. 17 v Question: The B-field from the induced current repels the approaching magnet, Yes or no? The Polarity of an Induced Voltage 18 The Polarity of an Induced Voltage 19 Lenz’s Law • “The direction of an induced current (if one were to flow) is such that its effect would oppose the change in magnetic flux which give rise to the current.” • It’s all to do with the Conservation of Energy. • The magnetic field generated can only hinder the motion. Helping the motion would result in the creation of a perpetual motion machine, which violates the conservation of energy. 20 Mathematically • Induced voltage (e.m.f): 21 𝘀 = − 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 Induced Voltage 22 1. Define positive direction of area vector A 2. (Assuming B is uniform) take the dot product of B and A 3. Obtain the rate of B-flux change 4. Determine the direction of the current using the right hand rule Sign of Induced Voltage 23 Aside: Eddy Currents 24 • When current is induced in a conductor such as the square piece of metal, the induced current often flows in small circles that are strongest at the surface and penetrate a short distance into the material. • These current flow patterns are thought to resemble eddies in a stream. Because of this presumed resemblance, the electrical currents were named eddy currents. Change in Area or Field • Note, that an induced voltage can be a result of a change in area or magnetic field, or both! 25  l B Example 15.1 26 𝐵 𝑡 = 𝐵0 cos 𝜔𝑡 Area = r2 𝑚 = 𝜋𝑟2𝐵0 cos 𝜔𝑡 𝘀 = − 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 = − −𝜋𝑟2𝜔𝐵0 sin 𝜔𝑡 = 𝜋𝑟2𝜔𝐵0 sin 𝜔𝑡 If loop is connected to a circuit of resistance R, what is the current flowing through the loop?

Generator 27 Major Application of Inductance Production of Electricity 28 Conversion of one form of energy (e.g. wind, gravitational, chemical, nuclear) to electric energy. E.G. Nuclear Power 29 Induced E-field • If a changing magnetic flux produces an induced voltage, it must also induce an electric field. • Indeed it is this electric field that makes a current flow (current flows in direction of E- field). • Induced E-field is related to the induced voltage by: 𝘀 = ׯ 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 – Positive as e.m.f. equals work done by the E-field in moving unit charge around circuit. 30 E-fields from Changing Magnetic fields • Suppose we remove the conducting ring, and change the magnetic field. • Will there be an electric field induced? • E-field is generated whether there is a conducting loop or not. • Putting a conducting loop in the E-field is what causes a current to flow. 31 YES Induced E-field is Non- Conservative 32 B dt dQ I = E 0> F dt d B Electric field associated with an induced voltage.
