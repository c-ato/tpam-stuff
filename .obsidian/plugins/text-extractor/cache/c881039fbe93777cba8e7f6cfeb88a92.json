The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Figure 4.1: Table of thermal conductivities. Credit Resnick and Halliday Physics 1978. Problem 4.1 Simple conduction Consider a copper rod connecting two heat baths at T2 = 125◦C and T1 = 0◦C. It is thermally insulated (lagged) so there are no losses from its sides. The cross-sectional area is 1 cm 2 and its length is 25 cm. Assuming a steady state has been achieved, ﬁnd: 1. the temperature gradient; 2. the rate of heat transfer; 3. and the temperature of the rod 10 cm from the high temperature end. Problem 4.2 Melting ice A cylindrical copper rod of length 1.2 m and cross-sectional area 4.8 cm 2 is insulated on its curved surface to prevent heat loss laterally. The ends are maintained at an energy diﬀerence of 100 ◦C by having one end in a water-ice mixture and the other end in boiling water and steam. 1. Find the rate at which heat is transferred along the rod. 2. Find the rate at which ice melts at the cold end. [You may need to look up one physical value.] 4 HEAT TRANSFER 2 Problem 4.3 Dry and damp skiers 1. Calculate the rate at which body heat ﬂows out through the clothing of a skier. Use the following data: the body surface area is 1.8 m 2; the clothing is 1 cm thick; the surface temperature of their body is 33◦C and the outside temperature is -5 ◦C; and the thermal conductivity of the clothing is κclothing = 0.04 Wm −1K−1. 2. If the skier falls over so their clothes are now wet (foolishly, they were wearing cotton clothing), how does the rate of heat loss change? [You may need to look up a physical quantity.] Problem 4.4 Cylinders and spheres The way in which we deﬁned heat transfer was ˙Q = −κAdT dx . Let us deploy this in symmetric systems in two and three dimensions. Consider a cylindrical shell of uniform κ lying between r and r+dr. Assume the temperature is the same everywhere on that surface, but varies radially. Construct an equation for radial heat ﬂow, and integrate it. Perform the same exercise for a spherical shell lying between r and r + dr. Problem 4.5 The heat equation Consider a \"one-dimensional\" thermal conductor of uniform cross-sectional area A and thermal conductivity κ. Let the speciﬁc heat per unit mass be cv and the density be ρ. Now focus on a thin section through the conductor of length dx. Let the temperature T (x, t) now be a function of both position along the length of the thermal conductor, x and the time, t. 1. Determine the ﬂux of heat through the two faces, using for each face: ˙Q = −κA∂T ∂x . 2. Assuming that the thickness, dx is small what is the net heat ﬂux into the section? 3. How does the temperature, T , of the section change with time, t? The resulting equation ∂T ∂t = κ ρcv ∂2T ∂x2 = α ∂2T ∂x2 , where α is the thermal diﬀusivity of the medium, is called the heat equation. 4. If the temperature is linear in position i.e. T (x) = ˜T (t)x, what may be deduced about ∂T /∂t? 5. Thus taking ˜T (t) = τ , a constant, what is the consequence on the variation of ˙Q with x? Does this make physical sense? 4 HEAT TRANSFER 3 Problem 4.6 Series and parallel thermal conductors Consider two thermal conductances, with thermal conductivities κ1 and κ2, cross-sectional areas A1 and A2 and lengths L1 and L2. Initially connect them in series between two heat baths at T1 and T2. 1. What is the condition that no heat builds up at the boundary between them and hence there is a steady state heat ﬂow? 2. Deduce the temperature at the interface between the two materials. Now put them in parallel between the two heat baths, disregarding the inconvenient diﬀer- ence in lengths. 3. What is the heat ﬂow through each conductor? And what is the total thermal con- ductor? Is this consistent, physically, with the factor of A in the expression for the thermal ﬂux of a single conductor? Problem 4.7 Heat equation with internal heat generation Sometimes heat is produced within a body as well as conducted by it. Examples are: 1. electrical heating due to a current; 2. heating in the Earth is due to radioactive decays of predominantly 232Th, 238U and 40K, with half lives of 10 10 − 10 9 years, which provide half of the heat ﬂux from the interior of the Earth which is estimated to be 91.8 mW m−2 at the Earth’s surface. This is small compared to the approximately 1 kW m −2 incoming from the Sun. But, together with the primordial heat from the collapse of the matter to form the Earth (the other half of the heat budget), it provides the energy source to drive the convection in the Earth’s mantle which produces plate tectonics, for example. Construct the counterpart to the heat equation for a \"one-dimensional\" body, of constant cross sectional area A, speciﬁc heat per unit mass cv and density ρ. In the body there is such an internal heat source denoted by ˙q per unit volume.

After all, the bottom of the ocean should be beneﬁting from the heat ﬂux from the rock below. See Fig. (4.2) The heat current across the sea bed into the ocean is around 0.1 Wm −2. However the water is moving at around 1 cm s −1 in the \"Great Ocean Conveyor\" which is a very large convection cell running across the equator with warm water, sinking in the Arctic Ocean and taking a tortuous route via the Antarctic to be heated and upwell in the Indian and Paciﬁc Oceans and return via the Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic and ﬁnally pass the UK as the Gulf Stream. Estimate the distance travelled at the sea bed. Then estimate the increase in temperature of the ocean during that distance due to the heat ﬂux across the sea bed, given the speed is 1 cm s−1 and that the ocean from the sea bed upwards for 2 km is involved in the convection current. The speciﬁc heat of water is cwater = 4 103 J kg−1K−1 and the density of water is 10 3 kg m−3. The Great Ocean Conveyor is shown in Fig. (4.3) Figure 4.3: The Great Ocean Conveyor. Credit NOAA. Problem 4.9 Radiative transport in series with conduction and vacuum ﬂasks Consider a cylindrical thermal conductance of thermal conductivity κ, of cross sectional area A and length L, attached to a heat bath at T1. See Fig. (4.4). The heat bath and the the side of length L of the conductor are coated with a material of zero emissivity, so the only radiative transport is from the end of the cylinder of area A. We assume the emissivity of the end is unity, and the system is in a vacuum black body cavity at T = 0. Find an equation for the temperature of the free end of the conductor (the equation is not very easy to solve). By algebraic dimensional analysis, or otherwise, show there is a hidden temperature scale, T0, in the problem. ♣ By deﬁning dimensionless temperatures τi = Ti/T0 with i = 1, 2, determine an approx- imate expression for T2 when τi ≪ 1 and separate expression for τi ≫ 1. Sketch τ2 as a function of τ1. (You may disregard the melting temperature of Cu!) Can you think of a domestic item which uses the disparity of eﬃciency of radiative and conductive heat transport? 4 HEAT TRANSFER 5 Figure 4.4: A copper rod connected to a heat bath at temperature T1, cooling radiatively at the other end. Problem 4.10 Thermal capacitors and inductors? The problem earlier in this sheet about series and parallel conductors implies a similarity with Kirchhoﬀ’s laws for electrical (dc) circuits. What are the counterpart laws? ♣ Discuss what meaning might be given to the terms \"thermal capacitor\" and \"thermal inductance\" by analogy with ac electrical circuits. Are there physical ways to construct such objects?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
