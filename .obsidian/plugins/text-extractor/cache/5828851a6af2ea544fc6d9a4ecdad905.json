Waves carry Energy (Earthquake is a kind of wave). Familiar Waves https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-7510351-water-drop-making-ripple-shot-high-speed When Water is calm and relaxed When Water is moody Mexican wave There are many types of waves. Light is a particular type of wave. Aim of this lecture module is to derive BASIC EQUATIONS for describing waves, and learn the physical properties of waves. Periodic motion (oscillation)- review Waves are closely linked to periodic motion. In the following, we will briefly review periodic motion and see how this leads to the creation of waves. It has an amplitude A: the maximum displacement from the equilibrium point. Q: What keeps the periodic motion going? A: The restoring force. When the object is moved away from its equilibrium position, there is a restoring force trying to bring it back. When it returns to the equilibrium position, it has non zero speed, so it keeps on moving passing the equilibrium position. The process repeats, forever. Periodic motion has the following characteristics: It has a period T: the time for one cycle. It has a frequency f: the number of cycles per unit time (f=1/T). Energy • In terms of energy, exchange of kinetic energy and potential energy. • Total energy is conserved. A body undergoes simple harmonic motion is called a harmonic oscillator. In one dimension, the displacement of a harmonic oscillator is described by: Where is the angular frequency, and f is the phase angle. When the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium F = – kx, (why –kx, not just kx?) The periodic motion becomes a Simple harmonic motion. x A t Phase angle here is –90 degrees, an equivalent expression is : SHM-t Velocity in SHM (simple harmonic oscillator): Acceleration in SHM: The signs are used to indicate the directions of velocity and acceleration. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. Energy in SHM: With only the restoring force, the total energy is conserved. A swing slows down with time due to the presence of friction and air resistance. Peak speed in SHM: wA Energy in SHM: ½ m(wA)2 The energy of the oscillator equals the kinetic energy when the object is at its peak speed: (PE+KE). At peak speed (KE), PE is zero.
