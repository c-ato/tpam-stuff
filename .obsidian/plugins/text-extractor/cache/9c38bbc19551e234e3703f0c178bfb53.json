The near point is the closest distance for which the eye can form a sharp image (usually about 25 cm) – this changes with age! Object distance Focal length 0.25 m 1.68 cm 1 m 1.77 cm 3 m 1.79 cm 100 m 1.80 cm Infinity 1.80 cm s’ Image distance is fixed at s’= 1.8 cm The eye changes its focal length to accommodate the varying object distance. When two lenses are added together (no spacing) the focal length is Far sighted Near sighted Apparent size of an object http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/age11-14/glance/Light/Microscope_/index.html The microscope F01 Fe1 Object just outside Fo1 Initial image just inside Fe1 Final image 25 cm from The eye. Shorter focal length gives higher magnification. Magnification of a microscope? The Telescope Job of telescope is to make objects which are far away appear close - and magnify them! f0 fe Large diameter of the objective: to collect more light, so faint objects can be seen. 10 cm diameter lens, 0.7 cm pupil For high M, needs long focal length of the objective. Hence long telescope tubes. Magnifying power of a telescope The distant object subtends an angle α The final image subtends an angle β 1 m objective focal length and 5mm eyepiece focal length: M=200 Suppose two stars, one above and one below the optic axis, the angle between the two objects is 2α, the angle between the two images is 2β. The angular spread of the two objects has been stretched. Hence angular magnification.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
