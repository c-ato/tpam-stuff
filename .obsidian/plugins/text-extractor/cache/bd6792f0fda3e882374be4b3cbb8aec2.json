We will be concerned with poor conductors, called dielectrics, in which free charge is negligible. Under an applied electric field the charges in the atom are displaced while remaining bound. This effect is called polarisation. 11 Dielectrics • A dielectric (or dielectric material) is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field. • Where are they used? – They are placed between conducting surfaces in a capacitor • What are the functions of a dielectric? – To keep charged surfaces physically separated (electrical insulation) – To raise the capacitance, C of a capacitor 12 Simple Media • We will only consider “well behaved” dielectrics (true for EM2 as well) i.e. dielectrics that are (HILS): • Homogeneous - same throughout • Isotropic - same in all directions which means that P is parallel to E • Linear - P is proportional to E (true for small enough fields) • Stationary - volumes and areas do not move. 13 Polarisation • Polarisation is the effect of an E-field on any dielectric to cause the positive charged nucleus to be pulled in one direction and the negative charged electron cloud to be pulled n the opposite direction. • Consider a molecule in an E-field 14 Molecule in E-field 15 +- Molecule, No E-field Centre of -ve charge coincides with centre of +ve charge +- Apply E-field: charges become displaced. E 𝒑 Ed The molecule becomes polarised Polarisation • The dipole’s field acts oppositely to the applied field and this will reduce the field in the dielectric. 16 E If the dielectric consists of N such dipoles (molecules) per unit volume, we define its total polarisation as:- 𝑷 = 𝑁𝒑 = 𝑁𝑞𝒂 So the E-field inside the dielectric is less than the external applied E-field. Dielectric E-field due to dipoles Polarisation • Polarisation: 𝑷 = 𝑁𝒑 = 𝑁𝑞𝒂 • The displacement of bound charges causes a build up of charge on the external surfaces. • Consider an applied E-field that is uniform and constant 17 E + + + Depleted of –ve charges There is an accumulation of positive charge on the right hand side surface and of negative charges on the left hand side surface. - - - Polarisation • Polarisation: 𝑷 = 𝑁𝒑 = 𝑁𝑞𝒂 • Consider the surface area of a block of dielectric, S • Surface charge = volume of depletion X molecular density X charge per molecule = 𝑎𝑆 𝑁 𝑞 • But 𝑃 = 𝑁𝑞𝑎 so surface charge, 𝑞𝑟 = 𝑃 𝑆 18 E + + + Depth of depletion = a, size of dipoles - - - At left hand side: 𝑞𝑙 = −𝑃 𝑆 So surface charge density, 𝝈𝒊 = ±𝑷 Dielectric Between Charged Plates 19 E0 E < E0 𝝈𝒊 = ±𝑷 Dielectric Between Charged Plates 20 Net surface charge = 𝜎 − 𝜎𝑖 For no Dielectric: 𝐸0 = 𝜎 𝜀0 With dielectric: 𝐸 = 𝜎−𝜎𝑖 𝜀0 = 𝜎−𝑃 𝜀0 But for well behaved dielectrics polarisation 𝑃 ∝ 𝐸 i.e. 𝑷 = 𝑬𝜺𝟎𝑬 𝐸 is called the electric susceptibility and is dimensionless Electric Susceptibility • Electric dipole moment, p has units C m • Polarisation, P has units p/volume = C m-2 • E-field has units: N C-1 • Permittivity of free space 𝜀0 has units: C2 m-2 N-1 So 𝜀0𝐸 has units: C m-2 same as polarisation, P • Hence electric susceptibility 𝐸 is dimensionless • Defined such that 𝑷 = 𝑬𝜺𝟎𝑬 where E is electric field inside the dielectric. 21 Back to Dielectric Between Charged Plates 22 For no Dielectric: 𝐸0 = 𝜎 𝜀0 With dielectric: 𝐸 = 𝜎−𝜎𝑖 𝜀0 = 𝜎−𝑃 𝜀0 We define the relative permittivity, 𝜀𝑟 = 1 + 𝐸 So 𝜀0𝐸 = 𝜎 − 𝑃 = 𝜀0𝐸0 − 𝐸𝜀0𝐸 i.e. 1 + 𝐸 𝜀0𝐸 = 𝜀0𝐸0 So 𝜀𝑟𝜀0𝐸 = 𝜀0𝐸0 E-field in dielectrics • 𝜀𝑟𝜀0𝐸 = 𝜀0𝐸0 • So E-field in dielectric 𝐸 = 𝐸0 𝜀𝑟 • i.e. the same as the E-field is free space divided by 𝜺𝒓 23 Capacitance when dielectric between parallel Plates 24 From Gauss’s Law: 𝐸 = 𝜎 𝜀𝑟𝜀0 = 𝑄 𝜀𝑟𝜀0𝐴 𝑉 = 𝑉+ − 𝑉− = 𝐸𝑑 = 𝑄𝑑 𝜀𝑟𝜀0𝐴 𝐶 = 𝑄 𝑉 = 𝜀𝑟𝜀0𝐴 𝑑 𝜀𝑟 > 1 so capacitance is increased Relative Permittivity 𝜀𝑟 • Relative permittivity, 𝜀𝑟 also called the dielectric constant. (It’s so great it has 2 names) • For E-fields in a dielectric, Gauss’s Law becomes: න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐 𝜀𝑟𝜀0 • For oscillating E-fields (e.g. EM waves) 𝜀𝑟 generally varies with frequency of E-field (EM2) 25 Relative Permittivity 𝜀𝑟 26 Material 𝜀𝑟 vacuum 1 (by definition) air 1.00059 PTFR/Teflon 2.1 Polystyrene 2.4–2.7 Mylar 3.1 Concrete 4.5 Pyrex (glass) 4.7 (3.7–10) Next Week • Be begin …….. 27","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
