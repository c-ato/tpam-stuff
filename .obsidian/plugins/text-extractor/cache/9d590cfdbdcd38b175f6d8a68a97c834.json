When the Airy discs overlap too much, the two objects cannot be resolved. D Focal plane Airy discs  Clearly resolved just resolved Not resolved (Raleigh)   The Raleigh criterion: Centre of one disc occurs at the first minimum of the other. To improve resolution: Use light with small ; Use large aperture! Resolution of the human eye ~ 500 nm, D=5 mm, (Size of pupil) Cannot resolve two objects separated by <1mm at 10 m distance.
