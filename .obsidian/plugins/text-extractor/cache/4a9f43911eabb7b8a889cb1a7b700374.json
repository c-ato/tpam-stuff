{"path":"Essay.pdf","text":"Essay The History and Application of Renormalisation and Regularisation In this introduction I will first give my motivations and then define and explain the dif ferences between renormalisation and regularisation. I have chosen this topic, as I will be participating in a Summer Research Programme for TQFT (topological quantum field theory) and I find that I am lacking in the prerequisite knowledge for this so to build up foundations for this I find that this may be useful, as it is a staple in regular QFT . I will present the history in a chronological manner and make suitable descriptions and comments, while calling back (or forwards?) on the techniques or reasoning used. Renormalisation is a set of techniques that deals with infinities that may give undefined results that arise in models and in someway manipulates the equation to give a definitive value (think ∞ − ∞ = X). This can be described as transformative. Regularisation on the other hand is a technique that usually fixes singularities (asymptotes) or errors formed by an inadequacy of the model itself by adding to the model. This process can be described as constructive. This is more common is QFT . The first meaning of \"renormalisation\" was defined in hydrodynamics, where it referred to a technique which dealt with the models inaccuracies indirectly , by redefining the parameters of the model to compensate for the additional contributions from the environment or other phenomena. This is usual used for theoretical models whose parameters have no experimental support and its also compensates on the lack of information on small scales.
