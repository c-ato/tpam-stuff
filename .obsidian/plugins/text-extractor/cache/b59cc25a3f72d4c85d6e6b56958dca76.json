Find the derivatives of following functions according to the definition, where they exist. (a) f (x) = x 2. (b) f (x) = e x. Solution. (a) We want to find f ′(x) = lim h→0 f (x+h)−f (x) h . Observe that for h ̸= 0 we have f (x + h) − f (x) h = 1 h [ ((x + h) 2 − x2) ] = 1 h [ (x2 + 2xh + h 2) − x2)] = 2x + h. Hence f ′(x) = lim h→0 (2x + h) = 2x. (b) From the trigonometric identity ex+h = exeh, it follows that e(x+h) − ex h = exeh − ex h = (e h − 1) h e x for all x ∈ R and h ̸= 0. Therefore, we have that lim h→0 ex+h − ex h = ex lim h→0 eh − 1 h = ex where we used notable limit, for all x ∈ R, as required. □ Q2. Assume that f (x) is an even function and differentiable at x = 0. Show that f ′(0) = 0. Solution. Since f is differentiable at x = 0, and f (−x) = f (x) for all x ∈ R, we have f ′(0) = lim h→0 f (h) − f (0) h = lim h→0 f (−h) − f (0) h = − lim ˜h→0 f (˜h) − f (0) ˜h = −f ′(0). Therefore, f ′(0) = 0, as required. □ 1 2 Q3. For each n ∈ {0, 1, 2}, define the function fn : R → R by fn(x) = { xn sin ( 1 x ) if x ̸= 0 0 if x = 0. These functions are all differentiable at all points x in R\\{0}, and hence continuous there. Decide whether these functions are continuous or differentiable at 0. Solution. We discuss these functions separately. (1) f0 is not continuous at 0, since lim x→0 f0(x) does not exist. In particular, f0 is not differentiable at x = 0 via Corollary 4.6, since f0 is not continuous at x = 0. (2) We claim that f1 is continuous at 0, but is not differentiable at 0. We recall Example 2.17 which demonstrates that f1 is continuous at x = 0. However, observe that f1(0 + h) − f1(0) h = h sin( 1 h ) − 0 h = sin 1 h . Since lim h→0 sin 1 h does not exist, it follows that f1 is not differentiable at 0. (3) We claim that f2 is differentiable at 0, and thus f2 is also continuous at 0. To show the differentiability, observe that f2(0 + h) − f2(0) h = f2(h) h = h 2 sin( 1 h ) h = h sin 1 h . Again, recalling Example 2.17, it follows that lim h→0 h sin 1 h = 0. Hence, f ′ 2(0) = 0 i.e. f2 is differentiable at 0. Via Theorem 4.5, it follows that f is continuous at 0 too. □ Q4. (a) If f (x) = x/ sin x, find the exact value of f ′(π/3) (b) If y = √1 + √x, find dy dx . Note that f ′(π/3) means to find the f ′(x) first and substitute in π/3 for x. It is not the derivative of f (π/3), which is 0. Solution. (a) By the quotient rule, f ′(x) = (sin x−x cos x)/ sin 2 x. Since sin(π/3) =√3/2 and cos(π/3) = 1/2, f ′(π/3) = ( √3/2 − π/6)/(3/4) = 2/√3 − 2π/9. (b) y = √1 + √x, so by the chain rule, if u = 1 + √x, dy dx = dy du du dx = d √u du d(1 + √x) dx = 1 2 √u . 1 2 √x = 1 4 √x√ 1 + √x . Although the curve y is defined for all x ≥ 0, the derivative dy dx is only valid for x > 0. □ Q5. (a) Find an expression (by implicit differentiation) for the derivative at the point (x, y) on the ellipse x2/3 + y2/6 = 1. Hence find the gradients of the tangent lines when x = 1/4. (b) Differentiate xcos x with respect to x. 3 Solution. (a) Differentiate both sides of x2/3 + y2/6 = 1 implicitly: 0 = d dx 1 = d dx ( x2 3 + y2 6 ) = 2 3 x + 1 6 dy2 dx = 2 3 x + 1 6 dy2 dy dy dx = 2 3 x + 2 6 y dy dx . Therefore, dy dx = − 2x y . Since y2/6 = 1 − x2/3 it follows that y = ± √47/8 when x = 1/4. Hence the gradients of the tangent lines to the ellipse when x = 1/4 are given by dy dx = −2x/y = ±√2/√47. There are two answers because there are two points on the ellipse with x-value equal to 1/4. (b) You can use logarithmic differentiation or the chain rule here. Using logarithmic differentiation, let y = xcos x, so that ln y = cos x ln x. Differentiating both sides with respect to x, implicitly on the left and using the product rule on the right, we get 1 y dy dx = 1 x cos x − ln x sin x, so that dy dx = y ( cos x x − ln x sin x) = xcos x ( cos x x − ln x sin x) . Alternatively, by using the chain rule, x = eln x so xcos x = (eln x) cos x = e ln x cos x. Let u = ev, so u ′ = ev, and v = ln x cos x, so v′ = (cos x)/x−ln x sin x. By the chain Rule, d dx xcos x = d dx eln x cos x = du dv . dv dx = ev ( cos x x − ln x sin x) = xcos x ( cos x x − ln x sin x) . It is implicit that one should write the answer to this question in terms of x. □ Q6. Prove that (sin x) (n) = sin (x + nπ 2 ) , (cos x) (n) = cos ( x + nπ 2 ) Hint - use mathematical induction. Solution. We prove the formula for sin x. It is helpful to recall that sin (x + π/2) = cos x. Let P (n) be the statement (sin x)(n) = sin (x + nπ 2 ) 4 for each n ∈ N. Then P (1) is true since (sin(x))′ = cos x = sin (x + π 2 ) . Suppose statement P (k) is true for some k ∈ N. Then, (sin x) (k+1) = d dx (sin x)(k) = d dx sin ( x + kπ 2 ) = cos ( x + kπ 2 ) = sin ( x + (k + 1)π 2 ) . Thus P (k) is true implies P (k + 1) is true. Via mathematical induction, P (n) is true for all n ∈ N, as required. □ Q7. Find the derivatives of the following functions. (1) y = x2 + 4x + 3 √x (3) B(u) = (u 3 + 1)(2u 2 − u − 6) (5) y = 1 t3 − 2t2 + 1 (7) y = x x + 2 x (9) y = t sin t 1 + t (11) y = x sin x tan x (2) g(x) = (x2 + 1)3(x2 + 2)6 (4) g(t) = (t + 1) 2 3 (2t 2 − 1)3 (6) f (x) = √ 1 + sin x 1 + cos x (8) f (x) = √ x + √x + √x (10) y = [x + (x + sin2 x) 3] 4 (12) y = tan(sec(cos x)) Solution. (Please note that you should provide full details for your assignments) (1) y = x 3/2 + 4x1/2 + 3 x1/2 =⇒ y′ = 3 2 x1/2 + 2x−1/2 − 3 2 x−3/2 . (2) g′(x) = 6x(x2 + 1)2(x2 + 2)6 + 12x(x2 + 1)3(x2 + 2)5 (3) B′(u) = 3u2(2u 2 − u − 6) + (u 3 + 1)(4u − 1) (4) g′(t) = 2 3 (t + 1)−1/3(2t2 − 1)3 + 12t(t + 1)2/3(2t 2 − 1)2 (5) y′ = − 3t2 − 4t (t3 − 2t2 + 1)2 (6) f ′(x) = 1 2 ( 1 + sin x 1 + cos x )−1/2 cos x(1 + cos x) − (1 + sin x)(− sin x) (1 + cos x)2 (7) y = x2 x2 + 2 =⇒ y′ = 4x (x2 + 2)2 (8) f ′(x) = 1 2 (x + √x + √x)−1/2 ( 1 + 1 2 (x + √x)−1/2) ( 1 + 1 2 x−1/2) (9) y′ = (sin t + t cos t)(1 + t) − t sin t (1 + t)2 (10) y′ = 4 (x + (x + sin2 x) 3)3 (1 + 3(x + sin2 x)2(1 + 2 sin x cos x) ) (11) y′ = sin x tan x + x cos x tan x + x sin x sec2 x (12) y′ = sec 2(sec(cos x)) sec (cos x) tan(cos x)(− sin x) □ 5 Q8. Use logarithmic differentiation to find the derivatives of the following curves y = f (x): (a) y = √xex2−x(x + 1)2/3, (c) y = sin(xx), (e) y = (sin x)ln x, (b) y = xx, (d) y = xsin x, (f ) y = (ln x) sin x. Solution. (Please note that you should provide full details for your assignments) (a) ln y = 1 2 ln x + (x2 − x) + 2 3 ln(x + 1) =⇒ y′ = √xe x2−x(x + 1)2/3 [ 1 2x + 2x − 1 + 2 3 1 (x + 1) ] . (b) ln y = x ln x =⇒ y′ = xx(ln x + 1). (c) y′ = cos(xx)xx(ln x + 1). (d) ln y = sin x ln x =⇒ y′ = xsin x (cos x ln x + sin x x ) . (e) ln y = ln x ln sin x =⇒ y′ = (sin x) ln x ( ln sin x x + ln x cos x sin x ) . (f ) ln y = sin x ln (ln x) =⇒ y′ = (ln x)sin x (cos x ln (ln x) + sin x 1 ln x 1 x ) . □ Q9. Find y′ if xy = yx. Solution. Using logarithmic differentitiation yields, y ln x = x ln y =⇒ y′ ln x + y x = ln y + x y y′ =⇒ y′ = ln y − y x ln x − x y . □ Q10. Suppose f : R → R is a function such that |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ |x − y| α, for all x, y ∈ R with α > 1. Show that f (x) = C for some constant C. Hint: Show that f is differentiable at all points and compute the derivative. Solution. If f ′ = 0 on the whole of R then f is a constant function. Observe that 0 ≤ |f ′(x)| = lim h→0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ f (x + h) − f (x) h ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ lim h→0 |h|α h = 0 ∀x ∈ R. Therefore, f ′(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R, and hence f (x) = C for some C ∈ R for all x ∈ R, as required. □ Q11. Let f : (a, b) → R be an unbounded differentiable function. Show that f ′ : (a, b) → R is unbounded. 6 Solution. Without loss of generality we assume that f is unbounded above. Since f is continuous, there exists a sequence {an} such that an ∈ (a, b) amd f (an) = 2 n for each n ∈ N (via the IVT and definition of f being unbounded). Thus, via the mean value theorem, there exists a sequence {ξn} with ξn ∈ (a, b) for each n ∈ N, such that 2 n+1 − 2 n b − a ≤ f (an+1) − f (an) an+1 − an = f ′(ξn) ∀ n ∈ N. Thus, f ′ is unbounded, as required. □ Q12. Using L’Hôpital’s rule, or otherwise, prove that the function f : (− π 2 , π 2 ) → R given by f (x) = { tan x−x x2 , if x ̸= 0 0 , if x = 0 is differentiable at x0 = 0 and state f ′(0). Is f continuous at x0 = 0? Justify your answer. Solution. Observe that lim h→0 f (0 + h) − f (0) h = lim h→0 tan h − h h3 = lim h→0 sec2 h − 1 3h2 = 2 3 lim h→0 sec h − 1 h2 = 1 3 . Thus f ′(0) exists and equals 1 3 . Since f is differentiable at x = 0, the necessarily f is continuous at x = 0 (via Theorem 4.5). □ Q13. Determine the following limits: (a) lim x→−1 x2 − 1 sin(1 + x) ; (b) lim x→0 kx − 1 x , where k > 0; (c) lim x→0 x sin x 1 − cos x ; (d) lim x→0 ex − 1 − x x2 . Solution. (a) Let f (x) = x2 − 1 and g(x) = sin(1 + x). Note that lim x→−1 f (x) = lim x→−1 g(x) = 0. Moreover, observe that f ′(x) = 2x and g′(x) = cos(1 + x). From L’Hôpital’s rule, it follows that lim x→−1 x2 − 1 sin(1 + x) = lim x→−1 2x cos(1 + x) = −2. (b) Let f (x) = kx − 1 and g(x) = x. Then lim x→0 f (x) = lim x→0 g(x) = 0. Note that f ′(x) = ln(k)kx and g′(x) = 1. From L’Hôpital’s rule, it follows that lim x→0 kx − 1 x = lim x→0 ln(k)kx 1 = ln k. (c) Let f (x) = x sin x and g(x) = 1 − cos x. Note that lim x→0 f (x) = lim x→0 g(x) = 0. Moreover, observe that f ′(x) = sin x + x cos x and g′(x) = sin x. Thus lim x→0 f ′(x) = lim x→0 g′(x) = 0. However, f ′′(x) = cos x + cos x − x sin x and g′′(x) = cos x. Thus, from L’Hôpital’s rule applied twice, it follows that lim x→0 x sin x 1 − cos x = lim x→0 sin x + x cos x sin x = lim x→0 cos x + cos x − x sin x cos x = 2 1 = 2. 7 (d) Let f (x) = ex − 1 − x and g(x) = x2. Note that lim x→0 f (x) = lim x→0 g(x) = 0. Moreover, observe that f ′(x) = ex − 1 and g′(x) = 2x. Thus lim x→0 f ′(x) = lim x→0 g′(x) = 0. However f ′′(x) = ex and g′′(x) = 2. Then, from L’Hôpital’s rule applied twice lim x→0 e x − 1 − x x2 = lim x→0 ex − 1 2x = lim x→0 ex 2 = 1 2 . □ Q14. Find dy dx by implicit differentiation. (a) x 2 − 4xy + y2 = 4. (b) cos(xy) = x + sin y. (c) tan ( x y ) = x + y. Solution. (a) By implicit differentiation 2x − 4y − 4x dy dx + 2y dy dx = 0 =⇒ dy dx = x − 2y 2x − y . (b) By implicit differentiation − sin(xy) ( y + x dy dx ) = 1 + cos y dy dx =⇒ dy dx = − 1 + y sin(xy) cos y + x sin(xy) . (c) By implicit differentiation sec2 ( x y ) y − x dy dx y2 = 1 + dy dx =⇒ dy dx = y sec2( x y ) − y2 y2 + x sec2( x y ) . □ Q15. Show by implicit differentiation that the tangent to the ellipse x2 a2 + y2 b2 = 1 at the point (x0, y0) is x0x a2 + y0y b2 = 1 . Solution. Applying implicit differentiation we obtain 2x a2 + 2yy′ b2 = 0. Rearranging this equation we obtain y′ = −b2x a2y . Therefore the tangent to the ellipse at (x0, y0) is given by y − y0 = −b2x0 a2y0 (x − x0). Rearranging this equation and using x2 0 a2 + y2 0 b2 = 1 gives us x0x a2 + y0y b2 = 1, as required. □ 8 Q16. A ladder 10 m long rests against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 metre per second (m/s), how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 m from the wall? Solution. Let x m be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall and y m the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. Note that x and y are both functions of time t, measured in seconds s. We are given that dx dt = 1 m/s and we are asked to find dy dt when x = 6 m. The relationship between x and y is given by (1) x2 + y2 = 10 2 i.e. both x and y are functions of t. Differentiating each side with respect to t using the chain rule, we have 2x dx dt + 2y dy dt = 0. Solving this equation for the desired rate, we obtain (2) dy dt = − x y dx dt . When x = 6, then via (1), y = 8. Substituting x = 6, y = 8 and dx dt = 1 into (2) gives dy dt = − 3 4 m/s. The fact that dy dt is negative means that the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground is decreasing at a rate of 3 4 m/s. □ Q17. A man walks along a straight path at a speed of 4 m/s. A searchlight is located on the ground 20 m from the path and is kept focused on the man. At what rate is the searchlight rotating when the man is 15 m from the point on the path closest to the searchlight? 9 Solution. Let x be the distance from the man to the point on the path closest to the searchlight in m. Denote θ to be the angle in radians between the beam of the searchlight and the perpendicular to the path. We are given that dx dt = 4 m/s and are asked to find dθ dt when x = 15. The equation that relates x and θ can be written as (3) x = 20 tan θ. By differentiating each side of (3) with respect to t, we get dx dt = 20 sec 2 θ dθ dt . Since dx dt = 4, it follows that (4) dθ dt = 1 20 cos2 θ dx dt = 1 5 cos2 θ . When x = 15 m, the length of the beam is 25 m. Hence cos θ = 4 5 . From (4) we conclude that dθ dt = 16 125 rads/s. □ Q18. A wire of length L is cut into two pieces. One piece is shaped into a circle and the other is shaped into a square. Let AC be the area contained within the circle and AS be the area contained within the square. What are the maximum and minimum values of AC + AS? Solution. 0 ≤ x ≤ L. Let x be the perimeter of the circle. Thus, the total area A(x) = Ac(x) + As(x) is A(x) = π ( x 2π )2 + ( L − x 4 )2 = ( 1 4π + 1 16 ) x2 − L 8 x + L 2 16 ∀ x ∈ [0, L]. Thus, A′(x) = ( 1 2π + 1 8 ) x − L 8 ∀x ∈ [0, L]. It follows that A′(x) = 0 ⇐⇒ x = xc = L 4 π + 1 . 10 We note that A(xc) = L2 16+4π . We also note that A(0) = L 2 16 and that A(L) = L2 4π . Therefore, min x∈[0,L] A(x) = L 2 16 + 4π ≤ A(x) ≤ L 2 4π = max x∈[0,L] A(x) ∀ x ∈ [0, L], as required. □ Q19. Suppose f : [a, b] → R is differentiable and c ∈ (a, b). Show there exists a sequence {xn} converging to c, with xn ̸= c ∀n ∈ N, and such that f ′(c) = lim n→∞ f ′(xn) . Moreover, explain why this does not imply that f ′ is continuous. Solution. Recall that f ′(c) = lim h→0 f (c + h) − f (c) h . Let hn = c + 1/n for each n ∈ N. Then via the mean value theorem, for each n ∈ N there exists xn ∈ (c, hn) such that f (c + hn) − f (c) hn = f ′(xn) . It follows that xn → c and f ′(xn) → f ′(c) as n → ∞. This does not imply that f ′ is continuous at c, though. For continuity to hold for f ′ at c, we would require f ′(yn) → f ′(c) to hold for any sequence {yn} for which yn → c as n → ∞. □ Q20. Assume that f (x) is bounded on [a, ∞) for some a ∈ R, f is differentiable on (a, ∞) and lim x→∞ f ′(x) = b . Prove that b = 0. Solution. The mean value theorem implies that for any x > a, there exists c ∈ (x, 2x), such that (5) f (2x) − f (x) x = f ′(c). Since lim x→∞f ′(x) = b exists, and x → ∞ implies that c → ∞ it follows that (6) lim x→∞ f ′(c) = b. Alternatively, since f (x) is bounded, we have (7) lim x→∞ f (2x) − f (x) x = 0 . Thus via (5), (6) and (7), we have b = 0, as required. □ Q21. Use L’Hôpital’s rule to find the following limits, when it applies: (a) lim x→∞ ln x √x . (b) lim x→0+ ln x x (c) lim x→1 x 8 − 1 x5 − 1 (d) lim x→0 ( 1 x − 1 ex − 1 ) 11 (e) lim x→0+(tan 2x) x (f) lim x→∞ ( a 1/x + b 1/x 2 )x for a, b > 0 Solution. (a) This is “ ∞ ∞ ” form. lim x→∞ ln x √x = lim x→∞ 1 x 1 2 x 1 2 −1 = 0. (b) This is “ ∞ 0 ” form and L’Hôpital’s rule does not apply. lim x→0+ ln x x = −∞ . (c) This is “ 0 0 ” form. lim x→1 x8 − 1 x5 − 1 = lim x→1 8x7 5x4 = 8 5 . (d) This is “∞ − ∞” form. lim x→0 ( 1 x − 1 ex − 1 ) = lim x→0 ex − 1 − x x(ex − 1) “ 0 0 ” form = lim x→0 ex − 1 ex − 1 + xex = lim x→0 ex 2ex + xex = lim x→0 1 2 + x = 1 2 . (e) This is “0 0” form. lim x→0+(tan(2x)) x = lim x→0+ e x ln tan(2x) = exp ( lim x→0+ ln(tan(2x)) 1 x ) “ ∞ ∞ ” form = exp ( lim x→0+ 1 tan 2x sec2(2x)2 − 1 x2 ) = exp ( lim x→0+ 2x sin 2x lim x→0+ −2x cos x ) = e0 = 1 . 12 (f) This is “1 ∞” form. lim x→∞ ( a 1 x + b 1 x 2 )x = lim x→∞ exp     ln ( a 1 x +b 1 x 2 ) 1 x     “ 0 0 ” form = exp    lim x→∞ ( a1/x+b1/x 2 )−1 ( 1 2 a 1/x ln a(− 1 x2 ) + 1 2 b1/x ln b(− 1 x2 ) ) − 1 x2    = exp ( lim x→∞ ( a 1/x + b1/x 2 )−1 1 2 (a 1/x ln a + b 1/x ln b)) = e ln a+ln b 2 = √ab . □ Q22. Find the limit lim x→∞ (x + 2) 1 x − x 1 x (x + 3) 1 x − x 1 x . Solution. Observe that (8) lim x→∞ (x + 2) 1 x − x 1 x (x + 3) 1 x − x 1 x = lim x→∞ (1 + 2 x ) 1 x − 1 (1 + 3 x ) 1 x − 1 which is a “ 0 0 ” form. Let y = ( 1 + a x )1/x , for constant a > 0 and x > 0. Then, (9) ln y = 1 x ln ( 1 + a x ) =⇒ y′ = − (1 + a x )1/x [ a x2 ( 1 x + a ) + 1 x2 ln ( 1 + a x )] . Therefore, via L’Hôpital’s rule, it follows from (8) and (9) that lim x→∞ (1 + 2 x ) 1 x − 1 (1 + 3 x ) 1 x − 1 = lim x→∞ (1 + 2 x )1/x [ 2 x2 1 x+2 + 1 x2 ln(1 + 2 x )] (1 + 3 x )1/x [ 3 x2 1 x+3 + 1 x2 ln(1 + 3 x )] = lim x→∞ 2 x+2 + ln(1 + 2 x ) 3 x+3 + ln(1 + 3 x ) = lim x→∞ − 2 (x+2)2 − 2 x(x+2) − 3 (x+3)2 − 3 x(x+3) = lim x→∞ (x + 3)2 (x + 2)2 lim x→∞ 2(1 + x+2 x ) 3(1 + x+3 x ) = 2 3 . □ 13 Q23. Prove that ln(1 + x) < x √1 + x for all x > 0. Solution. Let f : [0, ∞) → R be given by f (x) = ln(1 + x) − x √1 + x ∀ x ≥ 0. Thus f (0) = 0 and (10) f ′(x) = 1 1 + x − 1 √x + 1 + x 2 √x + 1(x + 1) = 2 √1 + x − 2 − x 2 √1 + x(1 + x) for all x > 0. Since (2√1 + x − 2 − x)x=0 = 0 and (2√1 + x − 2 − x) ′ = 1 √1 + x − 1 < 0 ∀ x > 0 it follows that 2 √1 + x − 2 − x < 0 for all x > 0. Hence, via (10) it follows that f ′(x) < 0 for all x > 0. This f (x) < 0 for all x < 0 which implies that ln(1 + x) < x √1 + x for all x > 0 as required. □ Q24. Use Taylor’s Theorem to approximate the following functions f : Dom(f ) → R about points x ∈ Dom(f ). Moreover, state an appropriate error term for your approximation in each case. (a) f (x) = tan x about x = 0, accurate to order 3 terms. (b) f (x) = e x about x = 0, accurate to order 4 terms. (c) f (x) = ln x about x = 1, accurate to order 4 terms. (d) f (x) = cos x − 1 about x = 2π, accurate to order 4 terms. Solution. (a) Let f : (− π 2 , π 2 ) → R be given by f (x) = tan x for all x ∈ (− π 2 , π 2 ). Observe that f (x) = sin x cos x , f ′(x) = 1 cos2 x , f ′′(x) = 2 sin x cos3 x , f ′′′(x) = 2 cos4 x + 2 tan 2 x cos2 x , for all x ∈ (− π 2 , π 2 ). Thus f (0) = 0, f ′(0) = 1, f ′′(0) = 0 and f ′′′(0) = 2. Via Taylor’s theorem it follows that f (x) = 0x 0 0! + 1x 1! + 0x2 2! + 2x 3 3! + R3(x) = x + x3 3 + R3(x), with R3(x) = f (4)(c)x 4 4! for some c between 0 and x. (b) Let f : R → R be given by f (x) = ex for all x ∈ R. Observe that f (n)(x) = f (x) = ex ∀x ∈ R and n ∈ N ∪ {0}. Thus f (n)(0) = 1 for all n ∈ N ∪ {0}. Via Taylor’s theorem it follows that (11) f (x) = 1x0 0! + 1x 1! + 1x 2 2! + 1x3 3! + 1x4 4! + R4(x) = 1 + x + x2 2 + x3 6 + x4 24 + R4(x) 14 with R4(x) = ecx5 5! for some c between 0 and x. (c) Let f : (0, ∞) → R be given by f (x) = ln x for all x ∈ (0, ∞). Observe that f (x) = ln x, f ′(x) = 1 x , f ′′(x) = −1 x2 , f ′′′(x) = 2 x3 , f ′′′′(x) = −6 x4 , for all x ∈ (0, ∞). Thus f (1) = 0, f ′(1) = 1, f ′′(1) = −1, f ′′′(1) = 2 and f ′′′′(1) = −6. Via Taylor’s theorem it follows that f (x) = 0(x − 1)0 0! + 1(x − 1) 1! + −1(x − 1)2 2! + 2(x − 1)3 3! + −6(x − 1)4 4! + R4(x) = (x − 1) − (x − 1)2 2 + (x − 1)3 3 − (x − 1) 4 4 + R4(x) with R4(x) = f (5)(c)(x−1)5 5! for some c between 1 and x. (d) Let f : R → R be given by f (x) = cos x − 1 for all x ∈ R. Observe that f (x) = cos x − 1, f ′(x) = − sin x, f ′′(x) = − cos x, f ′′′(x) = sin x, f ′′′′(x) = cos x, for all x ∈ R. Thus f (2π) = 0, f ′(2π) = 0, f ′′(2π) = −1, f ′′′(2π) = 0 and f ′′′′(2π) = 1. Via Taylor’s theorem it follows that f (x) = 0(x − 2π) 0 0! + 0(x − 2π) 1! + −1(x − 2π)2 2! + 0(x − 2π)3 3! + 1(x − 2π)4 4! + R4(x) = − (x − 2π) 2 2! + (x − 2π) 4 4! + R4(x) with R4(x) = − sin (c)(x−1) 5 5! for some c between 2π and x. □ Q25. Determine the types of stationary points for f : R → R given by f (x) = x4 − 6x2 + 8x + 1 ∀ x ∈ R. Solution. Observe that f ′(x) = 4x3 − 12x + 8, f ′′(x) = 12x2 − 12, for all x ∈ R. On sight x = 1 (and after factorisation) x = −2 are the only values of x at which f ′(x) = 0. Since f ′′(2) > 0, f has a local minima at x = 2. Since f ′′(1) = 0, and f ′′(1 + h) > 0 with f ′′(1 − h) < 0 for all sufficiently small h > 0 then it follows that f has an inflection point at x = 1. □ 15 Q26. Sketch the curve y = 2x 2 x2 − 1 . Solution. A The domain is {x ∈ R : x2 − 1 ̸= 0 } = {x ∈ R \\ {−1, 1}}. B The x- and y- intercepts are both 0. C The curve is symmetric about the y-axis. You can observe this since 2x2 x2−1 = 2(−x)2 (−x)2−1 . D lim x→±∞ 2x2 x2 − 1 = 2, therefore the line y = 2 is a horizontal asymptote. Since the denominator is 0 when x = ±1, we compute the following limits: lim x→1− 2x2 x2 − 1 = −∞ , lim x→1+ 2x2 x2 − 1 = ∞ lim x→−1+ 2x2 x2 − 1 = −∞ , lim x→−1+ 2x2 x2 − 1 = ∞ . Therefore the lines x = 1 and x = −1 are vertical asymptotes. E Observe that f ′(x) = (x2 − 1 ) (4x) − 2x2 · 2x (x2 − 1)2 = −4x (x2 − 1)2 for all x ∈ R \\ {−1, 1}. Since f ′(x) > 0 when x < 0 and f ′(x) < 0 when x > 0, we infer that f is increasing on (−∞, 0) \\ {−1} and decreasing on (0, ∞) \\ {1}. F y′ = 0 ⇐⇒ x = 0 so the only critical point is located at x = 0. G Note that f ′′(x) = (x2 − 1 )2 (−4) + 4x · 2 (x2 − 1 ) 2x (x2 − 1) 4 = 12x2 + 4 (x2 − 1) 3 for all x ∈ R \\ {−1, 1}. Since f ′′(0) = −4 < 0 if follows that there is a local maximum at (0, 0). Moreover, f ′′(x) > 0 ⇐⇒ |x| > 1. Thus the curve is concave upward on R \\ [−1, 1] and concave downward on (−1, 1). It has no points of inflection since 1 and −1 are not in the domain of f . H For a sketch see Figure 1. Figure 1. A sketch of the curve in Question 20 □ Q27. Let f : R → R be the function defined by f (x) = x2ex for all x ∈ R. 16 (i) Calculate f ′ and f ′′. (ii) Find and determine the nature of the stationary points of f . (iii) Find the points of inflection of f . (iv) Determine the regions in which f is strictly increasing and decreasing. (v) Determine the regions in which f is concave up and concave down. (vi) Determine all the asymptotes of f . (vii) Sketch the graph of f . Solution. (i) Note that f ′(x) = x(x + 2)ex, f ′′(x) = (x2 + 4x + 2)ex, for all x ∈ R. (ii) Observe that f ′(x) = 0 =⇒ x = 0 or x = −2. Moreover, f ′′(0) > 0 means there is a local minima at x = 0. Also f ′′(−2) < 0 means that there is a local maxima at x = −2. (iii) Observe that f ′′(x) = 0 =⇒ x = −4±√8 2 = −2±√2. It follows that f ′′ changes signs at these two points. So there are points of inflection at x = −2 ± √2. (iv) Observe that f ′(x) > 0 ⇐⇒ x < −2 or x > 0, where, f is strictly increasing. Also f ′(x) > 0 ⇐⇒ −2 < x < 0, where f is strictly decreasing. (v) Observe that f ′′(x) > 0 ⇐⇒ x < −2 − √2 or x > −2 + √2, where f is concave up. Also, f ′′(x) < 0 ⇐⇒ −2 − √2 < x < −2 + √2, where f is concave down. (vi) There are no vertical asymptotes. Moreover, f (x) → 0 as x → −∞ and f (x) → ∞ as x → ∞. Thus, there is a horizontal asymptote at y = 0. (vii) See Figure 2. Figure 2. Sketch of f (x) = x2xx. □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
