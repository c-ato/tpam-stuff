Evans d.evans@bham.ac.uk Last Lecture • Devices designed to have a self-inductance are called Inductors. • Definition of self-inductance: • Energy Stored in an inductor: • Energy Density in a Magnetic Field 2 𝑁𝑚 = 𝐿𝐼 𝜀 = −𝐿 𝑑𝐼 𝑑𝑡 𝑈𝐿 = 1 2 𝐿𝐼2 𝑢𝐵 = 1 2 𝐵2 𝜇0 This Lecture • Inductor in a circuit • Quiz Time – inductance of a solenoid • Mutual Inductance • Applications of mutual inductance • Magnetic materials 3 Inductor in a Circuit • Consider the following circuit: 4 At t = 0 the switch is closed and an increasing current I(t) begins to flow. This causes an emf in the inductor that opposes the driving voltage, V. This back emf appears as a voltage drop across the inductor. Thus 𝑉𝐿 + 𝑉𝑅 = 𝑉 Inductor in a Circuit • 𝑉𝐿 + 𝑉𝑅 = 𝑉 • : 5 I.e 𝐼𝑅 + 𝐿 𝑑𝐼 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑉 Let’s use visualizer to solve for I(t) Inductor in a Circuit 6 Current doesn’t go to steady state value, I0 immediately due to inductance. 𝐼 𝑡 = 𝐼0 1 − 𝑒−𝑡 𝜏 where 𝜏 = 𝐿/𝑅 When switch is opened from stead state: 𝐼 𝑡 = 𝐼0𝑒−𝑡 𝜏 Inductor in a Circuit 7 Current in RL circuit after Switch is closed Example 18.1 How would the self-inductance of a solenoid be changed if 1. the same length of wire were wound onto a cylinder of the same diameter but twice the length? 2. twice as much wire were wound onto the same cylinder? 3. the same length of wire were wound onto a cylinder of the same length but twice the diameter? 8 Answers • 𝐿 = 𝜇0𝑛2𝑙𝜋𝑅2 1. [the same length of wire were wound onto a cylinder of the same diameter but twice the length?] Since the diameter does not change, the number of turns and the area A remain constant. However, n2 is diminished by a factor of 4 and l is increased by a factor of 2. Thus L is reduced by a factor of 2 9 Answers • 𝐿 = 𝜇0𝑛2𝑙𝜋𝑅2 2. [twice as much wire were wound onto the same cylinder?] Using twice as much wire and making no other change, n2 is increased by a factor of 4. Hence, L is increased by a factor of 4 10 Answers • 𝐿 = 𝜇0𝑛2𝑙𝜋𝑅2 = 𝜇0𝑛2𝑙𝐴 3. [the same length of wire were wound onto a cylinder of the same length but twice the diameter?] With twice the diameter, n2 is reduced by a factor of 4, but A is increased by the same factor; L is unchanged. 11 Inductance • A current loop produces a magnetic field • But a changing magnetic flux produces an induced voltage in a conducting loop. 12 𝐵𝑥 = 𝜇0𝐼 𝑎2 2 𝑥2+𝑎2 3/2 𝜀 = − 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 Mutual Inductance • A changing current in loop 1 causes a changing flux in loop 2 inducing a voltage • 𝜀2 = −𝑁2 𝑑2 𝑑𝑡 • 2 ∝ 𝐵 ∝ 𝑖1 13 Mutual Inductance • The mutual inductance M21 is defined by the equation: • 𝑁22 = 𝑀21𝑖1 • The mutual inductance M21 may also be defined by the equation: • 𝜀2 = −𝑀21 𝑑𝑖1 𝑑𝑡 • As 𝜀2 = −𝑁2 𝑑2 𝑑𝑡 14 Mutual Inductance • It can be shown that the same value is obtained for M if one considers the flux threading the first loop when a current flows through the second loop: • 𝑀 = 𝑁22 𝑖1 = 𝑁11 𝑖2 • 𝜀2 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖1 𝑑𝑡 & 𝜀1 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖2 𝑑𝑡 • SI Unit of mutual inductance is the Henry (H) 15 Mutual Inductance Mutually induced voltages Mutual Inductance The induced emf, 𝜀2 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖1 𝑑𝑡 has the following features: • The induced emf opposes the magnetic flux change • The induced emf increases if the currents changes very fast • The induced emf depends on M, which depends only the geometry of the two coils and not the current. • For a few simple cases, M can be calculated, but usually it is just measured. 16 Example 18.2 Two coils have mutual inductance of 3 x 10-4 H. The current in the first coil increases at a uniform rate of 800 A/s. 1. What is the magnitude of the induced emf in the second coil? Is it constant? 𝜀2 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖1 𝑑𝑡 = −3 × 10−4 × 800 = −𝟎. 𝟐𝟒𝑽 (Yes, constant) 2. suppose that the current is instead in the 2nd coil, what is the magnitude of the induced emf in the 1st coil? 17 𝜀1 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖2 𝑑𝑡 = −3 × 10 −4 × 800 = −𝟎. 𝟐𝟒𝑽 Application - Transformer 18 AC current in in primary coil induces a magnetic flux in the iron core. Assuming no flux leakage, the emf per turn is the same for primary and secondary coils. Hence 𝑉𝑝(𝑡) 𝑁𝑝 = 𝑉𝑠(𝑡) 𝑁𝑠 or 𝑉𝑠, 𝑟𝑚𝑠 = 𝑁𝑠 𝑁𝑝 𝑉𝑝, 𝑟𝑚𝑠 Transformers • Used to increase (step up) or decrease (step down) AC voltages. 19 Application 2 – Airport Metal Detectors • Pulsed current → pulsed magnetic field → Induces emf in metal • Ferromagnetic metals “draw in” more B → larger mutual inductance → larger emf • Emf → current (how much, how long it lasts, depends on the resistivity of the material) • Decaying current produces decaying magnetic field → induces current in receiver coils • Magnitude & duration of signal depends on the composition and geometry of the metal object 20 Application 3 • Pacemakers – It’s not easy to change the battery! – Instead, use an external AC supply. • Alternating current: → Alternating B-field → alternating flux m inside “wearer” → induces AC current to charge up pacemaker 21 Summary • Current in RL circuit when switched on 𝐼 𝑡 = 𝐼0 1 − 𝑒−𝑡 𝜏 • Mutual inductance from two coils: 𝑀 = 𝑁22 𝑖1 = 𝑁11 𝑖2 𝜀2 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖1 𝑑𝑡 & 𝜀1 = −𝑀 𝑑𝑖2 𝑑𝑡 • AC Transformer 𝑉𝑝(𝑡) 𝑁𝑝 = 𝑉𝑠(𝑡) 𝑁𝑠 22","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
