The loop of wire in the ﬁgure below forms a right triangle and carries a current I = 5 A in the direction shown. The loop is in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld that has magnitude B = 3 T and the same direction as the current in side PQ of the loop, see ﬁgure. 1. Find the force exerted by the magnetic ﬁeld on each side of the triangle. [3] 2. The loop is pivoted about an axis that lies along side PR. (a) Use the forces calculated in part (1) to calculate the net torque on the loop. [1] (b) Is the torque to rotate point Q into the plane of the ﬁgure or out of the plane? [1] 3. Use the equation ⃗τ = I ⃗A × ⃗B to ﬁnd the torque on the loop. [1] Problem 2. An interstellar dust grain of mass m = 10−16 kg is (roughly) spherical with a radius of 3 × 10 −7 m. It has acquired a negative charge such that its potential is −0.15 V. 1. How many extra electrons has it picked up (to the nearest whole number)? [1] 2. What is the strength of the electric ﬁeld on its surface? [1] 3. The dust grain moves freely (with velocity much smaller than the speed of light) in a plane perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld, which in that region has a strength of 3 × 10 −10 T. (a) What is the ”cyclotron frequency” associated to the dust grain motion? [1] (b) How many years will it take to complete a circular orbit? [1]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
