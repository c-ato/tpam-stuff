Derive an expression for the electric ﬁeld, Ein at any point within the space between a cylindri- cal conducting rod and a coaxial conducting tube around it. The rod and tube carry charges per unit length +λ and −λ, respectively. The ﬁnite radius of the rod is r1 and that of the tube is r2, with r2 > r1. [2] 2. Compute the value of the electric ﬁeld, Eout outside the tube. [1] 3. If the charge density on the coaxial tube is changed to −2λ, what effect will it have on the electric ﬁeld for: (a) r1 < r < r2? [1] (b) r > r2? [1] 4. From the result obtained in part (1), ﬁnd an expression for the potential difference between the rod and the tube. [2] 5. If the potential at inﬁnity is deﬁned as zero, what is the potential of the rod? [1] 6. Sketch the electric ﬁeld and electric potential as functions of r, including regions inside the rod and outside the tube. [2]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
