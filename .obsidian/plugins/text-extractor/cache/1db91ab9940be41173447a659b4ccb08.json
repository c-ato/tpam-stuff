Evans d.evans@bham.ac.uk Last Lecture • Visualisation of E-fields – Electric field lines • Continuous Charge Distributions – Using Coulomb's Law and integration • Some examples: E-field from ….. – Line of continuous charge – Uniform charged thin ring 2 Lecture 3 Content • Some more examples of continuous charge distributions – Uniform charged circular plane – Infinite plane – Inside charged hollow sphere • Electric flux • Gauss’s Law – Examples using Gauss’s Law 3 Example 3.1 – Large Circular Plane • Find the E-field due to large circular plane of uniform surface charge density, . 4 • Divide into infinite number of thin rings • First consider one ring element of width r. Example 3.1 Do example on the visualizer 5 For an infinite plane sheet of charge the E-field produced is independent of the distance from the sheet E = s 2e0 This result is true close to the surface of any charge distribution E-field Inside Charged Hollow Sphere 7 P Consider a point, P inside the hollow sphere Uniform charged shell Surface charge density,  E-field Inside Charged Hollow Sphere 8 Consider back-to- back solid angle, , from point P to the surface of the sphere   a2 a1  = a1/r1 2 = a2/r2 2 Aside – Solid Angle • 3D version of angle ➢ Angle,  = length of arc / radius (radians) • Solid angle = area of spherical surface / radius squared ➢  = A/r2 (dimensionless unit: steradians (Sr)) • Note: surface area of sphere is 4r2 so total solid angle (i.e. looking in all directions) is 4 • In differential form:  = sin() – i.e.  = ׬ 𝑑𝜑 ׬ sin 𝜃 𝑑𝜃 – In spherical polar coordinates 9 2 1 2 2 1 2 r r a a = D D All parts of the surface can be paired off Total E-Field at P is ZERO E-field in charged Sphere so Electric Flux • Electric flux is the amount of E-field passing across a surface – Defined in terms of a normal unit vector, ෝ𝒏 perpendicular to the surface 11 • For a constant E-field and flat surface: 𝐸 = 𝐴𝑬 ∙ ෝ𝒏 = 𝐸𝐴 cos 𝜃 • In general: 𝐸 = න 𝑬 ∙ ෝ𝒏 𝑑𝑆 = න 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 (I use dS as element of area but use dA if you like) Gauss’s Law 12 q Consider an imaginary closed surface around a charge q. The E-field at an element of surface, a distance r from the charge is: 𝑬 = 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟2 ො𝒓 q Gauss’s Law • So flux of E out of element of area dS is: 𝑑 = 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝐸 ∙ ො𝑛 𝑑𝑆 = 𝐸 cos 𝜃 𝑑𝑆 𝑑 = 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀𝑜𝑟2 cos 𝜃 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀𝑜 cos 𝜃𝑑𝑆 𝑟2 = 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀𝑜 𝑑 13 Total flux out of imaginary surface: 𝐸 = 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀𝑜 න 𝑆 𝑑 = 𝑞 4𝜋𝜀𝑜 4𝜋 = 𝑞 𝜀𝑜 Gauss’s Law Gauss’s Law: the net electric flux of E out of any closed surface, enclosing a total charge Qenclosed situated in a vacuum (air for practical purposes) is 𝐸 = න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 𝜀0 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 = σ𝑖 𝑞𝑖 or 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 = ׬𝑉 𝜌 𝑑𝑉 14 Gauss’s Law • This is Gauss’s Law – You need to know this and know how to use it න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 𝜀0 • Very useful for solving problems where there’s symmetry (see examples). 15 Solid Sphere with Uniform Charge 16 Q r Example: Sphere of radius R uniformly charged throughout its volume. Total charge Q (a) E-field for r > R Method: set up an (imaginary) Gaussian Surface and use symmetry (b) E-field for r < R Let’s solve this using the visualizer","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
