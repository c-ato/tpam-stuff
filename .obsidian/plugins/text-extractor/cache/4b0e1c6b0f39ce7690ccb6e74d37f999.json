Recordings will be available as well. o Lectures Thursdays 9am, Gisbert Kapp - GKAP-LT1 (Lecture 1 on 3rd Oct - Lecture 11 on 12th Dec) o Office hours 11:30-12:30 Thursdays, Physics East 207 • Recommended textbook: University Physics, Young & Freedman (library) • Visualiser – lecture notes. Anything I write live is intended for you to write down too. Anything I don’t (like this document!) you do not need to worry about writing down. o Hand-writing notes in class is evidenced to be a very good way to learn concepts and facts [1,2] -tactile response and physical map to information • Live lecture notes should give you a comprehensive set. My scanned notes (and these intro handouts) will be on Canvas. But I strongly recommend writing your own notes as we go. • ‘Handouts’ on Canvas are extra material for enthusiasts or in answer to FAQs – these are not required and can be quite advanced. • Every other week has an assessed problem set, but there are non-assessed problems with solutions in the weeks between – I encourage you to do those too (in groups even?) • You do not need to memorise names & dates [1] Why writing by hand is still the best way to retain information, C.E.
