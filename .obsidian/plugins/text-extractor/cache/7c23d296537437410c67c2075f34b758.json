Introduction to Data Analysis and Error HandlingHence µ(z) = µ(x)+µ(y) and σ2(z) = σ2(x)+σ2(y), or in less precise language, z0 = x0+y0 and δz2 = δx2 + δy2. Linear Combinations: z = ax + by, where a and b are constants. Combining the results of the previous two sections gives µ(z) = aµ(x) + bµ(y) and δ2(z) = a2δ2(x) + b2δ2(y). or in less precise language z0 = ax0 + by0 and δz2 = a2δx2 + b2δy2. Multiplication: z = xy. To evaluate µ(z) and σ(z) we note that E[ z] = E[ xy] = E[ x]E[ y] , E[ z2] = E[ x2y2] = E[ x2]E[ y2] , from which it follows that µ(z) = E[ z] = E[ x] E[ y] = µ(x)µ(y), σ2(z) = E[ z2] − E[ z]2 = E[ x2] E[ y2] − E[ x]2E[ y]2 = [ µ2(x) + σ2(x)][ µ2(y) + σ2(y)] − µ2(x)µ2(y) = µ2(x)σ2(y) + µ2(y)σ2(x) + σ2(x)σ2(y). We may combine these two equations to give σ2(z) Exercise 1: A loaded beam with dimensions ℓ, b and t is supported at the ends; the sag s at the midpoint is given by s = kℓ3","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
