The sample space Ω 2. The events which are subsets of Ω 3. The probability function 𝑃(𝑥) which assigns probability to every event in Ω The probability is normalised P Ω = 1 Introduction to Probability Combinatorics and Counting Combinatorics We count the number of ways of something happening. Example: We toss two dice. How many ways are there of getting a given total? One way to get 2: (1,1) Three ways to get a 4: (3,1), (2,2) and (3,1) Example: How many Sudoku boards are there? (≈ 6.7 × 1021) Introduction to Probability Nomenclature We will use Ω to represent the set of possible outcomes. We will use |Ω| to represent the number of outcomes. Example Toss one die: Ω = {1,2,3,4,5,6} Ω = 6 Introduction to Probability Sampling An important aspect (here) of combinatorics is sampling. Sampling involves 𝑁 objects and picking 𝑘 of them. For example: pick a 4-number password (a PIN). We can 1. Sample with replacement and keep order. Pick the 4 numbers freely. 2. Sample without replacement and keep order. Ensure that no numbers are repeated. 3. Sample without replacement and ignore order. The bottom door of Physics East! 4. Sample with replacement and ignore order.

Let the first have 𝑛1 choices Let the second have 𝑛2 choices.. etc. All the way up to 𝑛𝑘 Then there are 𝑛1 × 𝑛2 × ⋯ 𝑛𝑘 total choices. Introduction to Probability 3 choices from first set, 3 choices from the second 3 × 3 = 9 Sampling with Replacement Sample 𝑘 things from 𝑁 objects with replacement. The first has 𝑁 choices The second has 𝑁 choices.. etc. 𝑁 × 𝑁 × ⋯ × 𝑁 Ω = 𝑁𝑘 Example: How many 6 letter case-sensitive password are there? Introduction to Probability Ω = 2 × 26 6 Sampling without replacement Sample 𝑘 things from 𝑁 objects without replacement. The first has 𝑁 choices The second has 𝑁 − 1 choices.. etc. So Ω = 𝑁 × 𝑁 − 1 × 𝑁 − 2 … × 𝑁 − 𝑘 + 1 = 𝑁! (𝑁 − 𝑘)! Example: A lottery machine has 10 (different) numbers. Three are picked out. How many different sequences are there? Introduction to Probability Ω = 10! 7! = 720 Permutations Sample 𝑁 things from 𝑁 objects without replacement: i.e. we draw them all. We get Ω = 𝑁 × 𝑁 − 1 × ⋯ × 2 × 1 = 𝑁! The number of ways of permuting 𝑁 objects. Typically, 𝑁! 𝑁−𝑘 ! is called a 𝑘-permutation of 𝑁. Introduction to Probability Example: permute the digits (1,2,3) (1,2,3), (3,1,2), (2,3,1), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (3,2,1) Unordered Samples Hand of cards: the order the cards appear in the hand is irrelevant. Sample 𝑘 things from 𝑁 objects without replacing, and ignoring the order they appeared. We get 𝑁! (𝑁−𝑘)! for the possible draws, but this overcounts. We need to divide out the number of ways of permuting 𝑘 objects: 𝑘! Ω = 𝑁! 𝑘! (𝑁 − 𝑘)! ≡ 𝑁 𝑘 Introduction to Probability Example of overcounting. Draw two numbers from (1,2,3) Get 3!/1! for the 2-permutations Then we want (2,1) and (1,2) to be counted the same So 3!/(2!1!) = 3 2 Interpretations of Binomial Coefficient The expansion of 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑁 = ෍ 𝑘=0 𝑁 𝑁 𝑘 𝑎𝑘𝑏𝑁−𝑘 The number of ways to split 𝑁 objects into two groups with 𝑘 in one group and 𝑁 − 𝑘 in the other. What if we had more groups? Introduction to Probability Label objects 1 to N Pick k of them and ignore order Place these in one group 𝑁 𝑘 ways! Multinomial Divide a deck of cards into 4 even sized hands. The order of each hand is irrelevant. The first person picks 13 cards from 52: 52 13 The second person 13 cards from the remaining 39: 39 13 Ω = 52 13 × 39 13 × 26 13 × 13 13 = 52! 13! 39! 39! 13! 26! 26! 13! 13! 13! 13! 0! = 52! 13! 13! 13! 13!

𝑃 Groups Uniform Probability Uniform Probability The probability of an event 𝐴 is given by 𝑃 𝐴 = 𝐴 |Ω| = Number of elements in 𝐴 Number of elements in Ω The probability of A is the fraction of the sample space it takes up. This is known as the uniform probability. Introduction to Probability Examples Example How many distinct numbers are stored in a 16-bit binary number? Introduction to Probability Each number has two choices (0 or 1). There are 16 numbers so Ω = 2 16 Example How many different (not necessarily meaningful!) words can be made from Massachusetts? Introduction to Probability There are 13 characters. There are 4 s’s, 2 a’s and 2 t’s, so there are 13! 4! 2! 2! Example A bag contains 10 red and 6 orange balls. What is the probability of drawing two red and two orange balls? Introduction to Probability We pick 4 balls out of 16: Ω = 16 4 There are 10 2 ways to get red There are 6 2 ways to get orange 𝑃 = 10 2 6 2 16 4 = 10 16 9 15 6 14 5 13 × 𝟒 𝟐 Example How many ways are there to divide this class (approx. 140 people) into two even sized groups? What about four groups? Introduction to Probability Looks like 140 70 for two groups but we can ignore group labels → 1 2 140 70 Likewise → 1 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 140 35 35 35 35 Class Example An urn contains 10 red balls, 6 blue and 4 white. How many ways are there to get 3 reds, 2 blues and 1 white ball? What is the probability of seeing this? Introduction to Probability There are: 10 3 ways to get 3 red 6 2 ways to get 2 blue 4 1 ways to get 1 white So the total number of ways is 10 3 × 6 2 × 4 1 = 7200 Ω = 20 6 → 𝑃 𝐴 = 10 3 × 6 2 × 4 1 20 6 Class Examples What is the probability of: 1. Rolling a total of 5 when throwing 2 dice. 2. Drawing 2 aces from a deck of cards. 3. Splitting 7 people into three group, with 2 in group 1, 2 in group 2 and 3 in group 3. Introduction to Probability 1. Each dice has 6 outcomes: Ω = 62 = 36. There are 4 ways of getting a 5 so P A = A Ω = 4 36 = 1 9 2. There are 52 2 ways of choosing two cards, and there are (4 × 3)/2 = 6 ways of choosing two aces so P A = 6/(26 × 51) 3. Each person can be assigned to 3 groups so there are 37 ways of assigning. There are: 7 2 3 3 = 210 Ways to assign into the groups, so the probability is P A = 210 37 = 70 729","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
