Low ≈ 103 denser than gas High Low Disordered Highly ordered No Yes ≈ 103 denser than gas Low Disordered No The interatomic spacing (dependent on density and somewhat compressibility) is similar for solids and liquids Rayleigh’s oil drop measurement Olive oil (hydrocarbon chain) Volume = V Water Rayleigh’s oil drop measurementRayleigh’s oil drop measurement d Rayleigh’s oil drop measurement r By measuring the radius of the oil circle, r, the atomic distance could be related to the volume of the oil drop, V, through and hence 𝑑 = 𝑉 𝜋𝑟2. Rayleigh’s original experiment gave ~ 1 nm 𝑉 = 𝜋𝑟2𝑑, Measurement of an atom’s size (latent heat) We know that there must be an attractive force keeping diatomic molecules together If we were to separate the atoms to infinity, it would take some amount of work (U0) As there are two atoms, the amount of work per atom is U0/2 Measurement of an atom’s size (latent heat) What about for a solid or liquid? https://www.physics-in-a-nutshell.com/img/content/solid-state-physics/fcc-coordination-number-nearest-neighbours.svg In this case, to separate atom from its nearest neighbours takes 12 x U0/2 Nearest neighbours of a solid (HCP) Inefficient! Efficient! Most efficient packing for spheres is a hexagonal arrangement… Like the FCC structure, each non-surface atom has 12 nearest neighbours Measurement of an atom’s size (latent heat) Latent heat of vaporisation, L, (J kg): the amount of heat required to completely vaporise a liquid into a gas. 𝐿 = 12 Τ𝑈0 2 × 𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠 𝑘𝑔 𝑘𝑔 𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠 = 𝜌 × 𝑑3 where 𝜌 is the density of the liquid in question, and 𝑑 is the interatomic spacing. Hence, 𝑑 = 3 𝑘𝑔 𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠×𝜌 What causes force between atoms? Electrostatic/Coulomb force? No, atoms are electrically neutral… Nuclear force? No, the range of this force is ≈3 fm (3 x 10-15 m)… Weak force? Even worse! Range of ≈10-16 m Gravitational force? Assuming lead (m ≈ 208 amu = 3.45 x 10-25 kg): 𝐹 = 𝐺𝑚1𝑚2 𝑟2 = 6.67×10−11×3.45×10−25×3.45×10−25 2×10−10 = 4.0 x10 −50N What about normal atoms? e− e− e− e− e− e− e−e−e− e− e− e−e− + e− e− e− e− e− e− e−e−e− e− e− e−e− + δ+ δ- Fluctuations in the electron cloud cause the atom to behave as an instantaneous dipole What about normal atoms? e− e− e− e− e− e− e−e−e− e− e− e−e− e− e− e− e− e− e− e−e−e− e− e− e−e− + δ+ δ- The second atom is polarised by the electric field and becomes a dipole as well + δ+ δ- What about normal atoms? e− e− e− e− e− e− e−e−e− e− e− e−e− e− e− e− e− e− e− e−e−e− e− e− e−e− + δ+ δ- The second atom is polarised by the electric field and becomes a dipole as well + δ+ δ- What about normal atoms? e− e− e− e− e− e− e−e−e− e− e− e−e− e− e− e− e− e− e− e−e−e− e− e− e−e− + δ+ δ- The second atom’s dipole field is experienced by the first atom and so on… + δ+ δ- Van der Waal’s force The electric field due to a dipole goes as 𝐸 ∝ 1 𝑟3 Hence, the size of the induced dipole in second atom goes as ∝ 1 𝑟3 Size of the induced dipole in first atom depends on strength of the dipole field and the size of the induced dipole in the second dipole 𝑉 ∝ 1 𝑟3 1 𝑟3 = 1 𝑟6 Inter-atomic forces Force between two atoms or molecules is positive if they repel each other, negative if they are attract each another Van der Waals force is therefore negative, as this attracts the two atoms together. BUT Atoms do not collapse on top of each other -> there must be a repulsive force Pauli exclusion principle Particles can be split into two kinds, fermions and bosons Fermions have half-integer spin (in units of ℏ) and are “antisymmetric”, while bosons have integer spin and are “symmetric” Indistinguishable fermions cannot occupy the same spatial quantum state, and hence repel one another -> approximate this as potential of form 𝑉 ∝ 1 𝑟12 Lennard-Jones potential First described an empirical potential between neighbouring atoms/molecules: 𝑉𝐿𝐽 = 𝐴 𝑟12 − 𝐵 𝑟6 Lennard-Jones potential First described an empirical potential between neighbouring atoms/molecules: 𝑉𝐿𝐽 = 𝐴 𝑟12 − 𝐵 𝑟6 Potential is at a minimum (ε) at a distance r0 Summary Discussed experimental methods that can be used (and have been, historically) to investigate the size of the atom Investigated the cause behind interatomic and intermolecular forces Looked at a functional form to describe the potential of these force (the Lennard-Jones potential)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
