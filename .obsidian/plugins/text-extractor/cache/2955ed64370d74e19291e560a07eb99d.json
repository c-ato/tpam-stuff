In this lecture • The production of X-rays • How to measure the wavelength of X-rays • Bragg scattering of X-rays by crystals and the Bragg conditions 3 X-Ray source 4 X-Rays 5 Crystaline materials as diffraction gratings (SrTiO3) – 0.389 nm spacing between green Sr atoms 6 Compton Scattering - Setup 7 X-Rays for crystallography","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
