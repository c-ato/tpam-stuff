The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Problem 2.1 Stretching When a mass of 600 kg is hung from a steel cable (density, ρsteel = 8 × 10 3 kgm −3) with a cross sectional area of 0.20 cm 2, it stretches 0.05 cm beyond the no-load length of 5 m. Determine the stress, strain and Young’s modulus of the steel in the cable. Problem 2.2 Lateral contraction Poisson’s ratio for steel is νsteel = 0.3. By how much does the steel cable in problem 1 change laterally when it is stretched by the weight? Problem 2.3 Stretching and cooling Consider the same steel cable as in problem 1. The coeﬃcient of (linear) thermal expansion of steel is αsteel = 1.3 × 10 −5 K−1. How much would the cable need to be cooled to compensate for the extension due to the weight? Problem 2.4 Auxetic materials Consider the two-dimensional auxetic material with geometry deﬁned in Fig. (2.1). All joints are freely hinged. As we vary θ, and wish to disallow the structure intersecting itself, Figure 2.1: The notation for auxetic materials. what is the inequality which ℓ1 and ℓ2 must obey? What is the Poisson ratio for this material? (Use the same deﬁnition as in three-dimensions, i.e. ν = δw/δℓ, where δw is the change in width, assumed to be a contraction in the deﬁnition, induced by the change in length δℓ. 2 ELASTICITY 2 Problem 2.5 Elastic energy of a compressed rod Consider a rod of square cross section with cross sectional area 4t 2. If the rod has an unstressed, or natural, length L0, what force is required to compress the rod to L0 − d, if the rod is composed of material with Young’s modulus Y ? What is the amount of elastic energy stored in the rod when it has been compressed by d? ♣Problem 2.6 Elastic energy of a bent rod and the Euler instability Consider the same uncompressed rod as in the last problem, but now bend the centre of the rod into an arc of a circle with radius a with angle θ. See Fig. (2.2). Figure 2.2: The rod of thickness 2t, bent through an angle θ. What is the length of the outer side of the rod and the inner side of the rod, assuming the ends of the rod remain ﬂat? Considering the rod as a set of thin rectangular plates which have been stretched or com- pressed, determine the elastic energy of the rod. If one now compares the energy of the compressed rod (in the last problem) with the elastic energy of the bent rod, at what applied force will the initially straight rod buckle as the elastic energy is lower than the compressed case? This is a variant of the Euler instability. The assumption of a circular arc is not quite right – so the estimate is a little too high.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
