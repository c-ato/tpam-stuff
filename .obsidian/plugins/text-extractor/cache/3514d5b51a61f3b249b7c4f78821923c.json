Evans d.evans@bham.ac.uk Last Lecture • Paramagnetic materials • Magnetic Susceptibility • Relative permeability • Ferromagnetic materials • Diamagnetic materials • Displacement Current Density 2 This Lecture • Ampere-Maxwell Law • Maxwell’s Equations in integral form • Vector calculus • Divergence and Stokes’ theorems • Maxwell’s Equations in differential form • The End 3 Extra Material – Towards Maxwell’s Equations • Physics beyond the Stand Module! • This lecture is not in the syllabus so you can relax. • However, we’ve got this far so may as well get to Maxwell’s Equations. 4 Ampere-Maxwell Law • Changing B-fields induce a changing E-Field. • ׯ 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = − 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 • And 𝑚 = ׬𝑆 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 • So: ׯ 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = − ׬𝑆 𝜕𝑩 𝜕𝑡 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 (Maxwell’s third eqn) • So, can a changing E-field induce a changing B-field? 5 YES Ampere-Maxwell Law • Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor in. • For an AC voltage, there will be an AC current in the circuit. 6 Apply Ampere’s Law around the wire, in front of a capacitor plate. Ampere-Maxwell Law 7 Consider plane surface, S1. ර 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = න 𝑆1 𝑱 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = 𝜇0𝐼 Now consider the surface, S2. ර 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = න 𝑆2 𝑱 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = 0 We seem to have a problem! S1 S2 Displacement Current Density • There is an AC current in the wires but not between the capacitor plates. • However, there must be something and that is an alternative electric field. • The plates and discharging and charging as the voltage alternates. • Current is rate of change of charge 𝐼 = 𝑑𝑄 𝑑𝑡 • And Current density, 𝐽 = 𝑑𝜎 𝑑𝑡 8 Displacement Current Density • Current density, 𝐽𝐷 = 𝑑𝜎 𝑑𝑡 • But for capacitor plates, 𝐸 = 𝜎 𝜀0 • So 𝐽𝐷 = 𝜀0 𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑡 This is known as the Displacement Current Density • It’s not a current, it’s a changing electric field but has the same effect as a current i.e. produces B-field. 9 Ampere-Maxwell Law • Ampere’s law needs to be modified to take the displacement current into account: • Ampere-Maxwell Law ׯ 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = 𝜇0 ׬𝑆 𝑱 + 𝜀0 𝜕𝑬 𝜕𝑡 ∙ 𝑑𝒔 10 Maxwell’s Equations In free space, in integral form: • ׬𝑆 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = ׬𝑉 𝜌 𝜀0 𝑑𝑉 M1 • ׬𝑆 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = 0 M2 • ׯ 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = − ׬𝑆 𝜕𝑩 𝜕𝑡 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 M3 • ׯ 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = 𝜇0 ׬𝑆 𝑱 + 𝜀0 𝜕𝑬 𝜕𝑡 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 M4 11 James Clerk Maxwell • British physicist • formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation (unifications of electric and magnetic forces) • Proposed light is EM radiation • helped develop the Maxwell– Boltzmann distribution, to describe kinetic theory of gases. 12 13 June 1831 – 5 November 1879 Considered the 3rd greatest physicist of all time (after Newton and Einstein) Vector Calculus Year 2 mathematics • 𝛻 = 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 Ƹ𝒊 + 𝜕 𝜕𝑦 Ƹ𝒋 + 𝜕 𝜕𝑧 ෡𝒌 • grad(a) → 𝛻𝑎 = 𝜕𝑎 𝜕𝑥 Ƹ𝒊 + 𝜕𝑎 𝜕𝑦 Ƹ𝒋 + 𝜕𝑎 𝜕𝑧 ෡𝒌 – (a is any scalar) • div A → 𝛻 ∙ 𝐴 = 𝜕𝐴𝑥 𝜕𝑥 + 𝜕𝐴𝑦 𝜕𝑦 + 𝜕𝐴𝑧 𝜕𝑧 • curl A → 𝛻𝑨 = 𝜕𝐴𝑧 𝜕𝑦 − 𝜕𝐴𝑦 𝜕𝑧 Ƹ𝒊 − 𝜕𝐴𝑧 𝜕𝑥 − 𝜕𝐴𝑥 𝜕𝑧 Ƹ𝒋 + 𝜕𝐴𝑦 𝜕𝑥 − 𝜕𝐴𝑥 𝜕𝑦 ෡𝒌 (describes the rotation of a vector field) 13 Two Vector Theorems (year 2 maths) • Divergence Theorem • ׬𝑆 𝑨 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = ׬𝑉 𝛻 ∙ 𝑨 𝑑𝑉 where S is the enclosed surface around a volume V. • Stokes’ Theorem • ׯ 𝑨 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = ׬𝑆 𝛻𝑨 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 where l is length of the boundary around the area S. • Both true for any vector A. 14 Maxwell’s Equation M1 • ׬𝑆 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = ׬𝑉 𝜌 𝜀0 𝑑𝑉 • Applying the divergence theorem to the LHS • ׬𝑆 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = ׬𝑉 𝛻 ∙ 𝑬 𝑑𝑉 • Hence ׬𝑉 𝛻 ∙ 𝑬 𝑑𝑉 = ׬𝑉 𝜌 𝜀0 𝑑𝑉 • If this is true for any volume, then: 𝛻 ∙ 𝑬 = 𝜌 𝜀0 15 Maxwell’s Equation M2 • ׬𝑆 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = 0 • Applying the divergence theorem to the LHS • ׬𝑆 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = ׬𝑉 𝛻 ∙ 𝑩 𝑑𝑉 • Hence ׬𝑉 𝛻 ∙ 𝑩 𝑑𝑉 = 0 • If this is true for any volume, then: 𝛻 ∙ 𝑩 = 0 16 Maxwell’s Equation M3 • ׯ 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = − ׬𝑆 𝜕𝑩 𝜕𝑡 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 • Applying Stokes’ theorem to the LHS • ׯ 𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = ׬𝑆 𝛻𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 • Hence ׬𝑆 𝛻𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = − ׬𝑆 𝜕𝑩 𝜕𝑡 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 • If this is true for any surface, then: 𝛻𝑬 = − 𝜕𝑩 𝜕𝑡 17 Maxwell’s Equation M4 • ׯ 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = 𝜇0 ׬𝑆 𝑱 + 𝜀0 𝜕𝑬 𝜕𝑡 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 • Applying Stokes’ theorem to the LHS • ׯ 𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 = ׬𝑆 𝛻𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 • Hence ׬𝑆 𝛻𝑩 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 = 𝜇0 ׬𝑆 𝑱 + 𝜀0 𝜕𝑬 𝜕𝑡 ∙ 𝑑𝑺 • If this is true for any surface, then: 𝛻𝑩 = 𝜇0 𝑱 + 𝜀0 𝜕𝑬 𝜕𝑡 18 Maxwell’s Equations 19 Electromagnetism 20","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
