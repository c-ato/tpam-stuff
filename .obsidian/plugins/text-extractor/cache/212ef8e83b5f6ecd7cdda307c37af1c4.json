The particle is in a state described by the wave function Ψ(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝐴 cos(𝑘𝑥) 𝑒!\"#$. a) Show that the wave function is an eigenfunction of the kinetic energy operator. [2 marks] b) Show that the wave function is not an eigenfunction of the momentum operator 𝑝̂%. [2 marks] c) In quantum mechanics, the “average” value expected for an observable, corresponding to the measurement of many particles prepared in the same quantum state, is known as an expectation value. Find the expectation value of the x-component of momentum, which is given by 〈𝑝%〉 = 3 Ψ∗ '( !( (𝑝̂%Ψ)𝑑𝑥. (Hint: because I have specified that the origin is at the centre of the well, you can solve the integral by inspection. Clearly state your reasoning.)
