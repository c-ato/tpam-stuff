The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Problem 5.1 Two-level gas Assume the gas is in thermal equilibrium, implied by the statement it is at 27 ◦C. Let the lower state be denoted E0 and the higher by E1, then the probability of each is the associated Boltzmann factor: p(E1) = Ae−E1/kbT and p(E2) = Ae−E2/kbT . Here A is determined by normalisation. To obtain the relative fraction of the atoms being in the ﬁrst or second state, prel: prel = p(E1) p(E2) = Ae−E1/kbT Ae−E0/kbT = e −(E1−E0)/kbT = e −E/kbT . Note 0 ≤ prel ≤ 1. Now at T = 27 ◦C, kbT = 1.38 × 10 −23 JK −1 × [300 K] = 4.14 × 10 −21 J = 4.14 × 10 −21 1.6 × 10−19 eV = 2.5 × 10 −2 eV . Now for the three cases, 1. if E = 1 eV, i.e. E ≫ kbT , e −E/kbT = exp ( − 1 2.5 × 10−2 ) = e −40 = 4.3 × 10 −18 . And we may immediately deduce that p(E0) ≃ 1 and p(E1) = 4.3 × 10 −18 . 2. if E = 0.1 eV, i.e. E > kbT , e−E/kbT = exp (− 0.1 2.5 × 10−2 ) = 0.018 . One might assume that this result implies that p(E0) ≃ 1, but we can check: p(E1) 1 − p(E1) = 0.018 ⇒ p(E1)(1 − 0.018) = 0.018 ⇒ p(E1) =≃ 0.018 , where we used the ﬁrst term of the binomial expansion for (1 − 0.018) −1. 5 KINETIC THEORY – SOLUTIONS 2 3. if E = 0.01 eV, i.e. E < kbT , p(E1) p(E0) = exp ( − 0.01 2.5 × 10−2 ) = 0.67 so p(E1) 1 − p(E1) = 0.67 ⇒ p(E1) = 0.40 So in the third case, the probabilities are roughly equal. Problem 5.2 Sketching Maxwell-Boltzmann The probability distribution for the y-component of velocity of the molecules of a gas at temperature T is sketched below in Fig. (5.1). Figure 5.1: Left: The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the y component of the velocity. Right: the probability distribution for the speed, v, in three dimensions. Problem 5.3 Speed versus velocity A sketch of the probability distribution for the speed of the molecules of a gas in three dimensions at temperature T is in ﬁgrefmaxbcom. The distribution reﬂects all three components of v = (vx, vy, vz), and the probability of all three components being small vanishes as |v| → 0. Problem 5.4 Internal energy of a gas If we write the internal energy of a gas, U (T ) = ( 1 2kbT ) × (?) × (number of molecules) , then the missing term the number of degrees of freedom. For a monatomic gas experiencing no external force, this number if the number of dimen- sions. For three dimensions the missing number is 3. ♣Problem 5.5 Approximations for probabilities The following techniques can be used on other problems. For example the ﬁrst technique may be used for for x ≫ α−1 in this integral ∫ ∞ x dy e −αy y . 5 KINETIC THEORY – SOLUTIONS 3 And an example for the second technique might be, for α1/8x ≪ 1, ∫ x 0 dy e−αx8 . (i) x ≫ α −1/2.. F (x) = ∫ ∞ x dy e−αy2 = ∫ ∞ x dy −2αy −2αy e−αy2 = [ e −αy2 −2αy ]∞ x − ( − 1 2α ) ∫ ∞ x dy ( − 1 y2 ) e −αy2 = e−αx2 2αx − 1 2α ∫ ∞ x dy −2αy −2αy e −αy2 y2 = e−αx2 2αx − 1 (2α)2 e−αx2 x3 − 3 (2α)2 ∫ ∞ x dy e −αy2 y4 ≃ e−αx2 2αx (1 − 1 2αx2 ) . (5.1) Since αx2 ≫ 1, this approximation is useful. One may continue this process more times – but there is a catch (see Y3 Perturbation Theory and Asymptotics). (ii) x ≪ α−1/2. they key idea is to approximate the integrand by Taylor expansion as the function does not vary much overr the region of integration. F (x) = ∫ ∞ x dy e−αy2 = ∫ ∞ 0 dy e−αy2 − ∫ x 0 dy e −αy2 = 1 2 √ π α − ∫ x 0 dy (1 − αx2 + · · · ) ≃ 1 2 √ π α − (x − αx3 3 ) = 1 √α ( √ π 2 − √ αx + 1 3 [√αx]3) . (5.2) Since √αx ≪ 1 this is a good approximation. Problem 5.6 A languid cyclist To set the scale of the cyclist’s speed, vcyc, versus the air molecules, we might remember they were close to the speed of sound, or calculate it. At room temperature the average value of |vx| is ⟨|vx|⟩ = √ 2kbT πm . For the majority component of the atmosphere, N2, at room temperature this was deter- mined in the lecture notes to be vnit ≃ 500 ms −1. 5 KINETIC THEORY – SOLUTIONS 4 Thus the cyclist is moving very slowly compared to the typical velocity of the air molecules at room temperature. We are in the second limit above Eq. (5.2), although we only want the second or perhaps third term as fraction of molecules slower than cyclist = ∫ vcyc 0 dvxp(vx) . The normalised MB distribution for one component of the velocity is p(vx) = √ m 2πkbT exp (− mv2 x 2kbT ) . Thus we may use the second term in the expansion, so fraction of molecules slower than cyclist ≃ vcyc √ m 2πkbT = 1 π vcyc vnit ≃ 1 π 5 500 ≃ 0.3% . I.e. a small fraction. Problem 5.7 Hot air – the leaky Earth The escape velocity of the earth is 1 2mv2 e = GM m R ⇒ ve = √ 2GM R . Here M ≃ 6 × 10 24 kg is the mass of the Earth, R ≃ 6.4 × 10 6 m is the radius of the Earth and G ≃ 6.7 × 10 −11 m3kg−1s −2 is Newton’s constant. Thus ve ≃ 11.2 kms −1 . At room temperature the typical vertical speed of 14N2 molecules is ⟨|vz|⟩ = √ 2 3π c ≃ 0.5 × 500 ms −1 = 250 ms −1 ≪ 11.2 kms −1 = ve from lectures. Thus we are in the ﬁrst limit and may use the approximation Eq. (5.1). We ﬁnd that for the nitrogen molecule, mass m, using Eq. (5.1): p(vz ≥ ve) = √ m 2πkbT ∫ ∞ ve dvz exp (− mv2 z 2kbT ) ≃ √ m 2πkbT 1 2 2kbT mve exp ( − mv2 e 2kbT ) = √ kbT 2πm 1 ve exp ( − mv2 e 2kbT ) = 1 2 ⟨|vz|⟩ ve e−(ve/⟨|vz|⟩)2/π ≃ 0.01 × e−700 ∼ 10 −350 . Here we used the crude estimate of e2 ∼ 10. It really does not matter; the number is minuscule. 16O2 has an even smaller probability. How to turn this into a rate is more 5 KINETIC THEORY – SOLUTIONS 5 complicated. We would need to admit the molecules interact and discuss how the velocity distribution is re-ﬁlled. There are several contributions in the high atmosphere for this, see this article. But the estimate for hydrogen is around 3 kgs−1. (where the counterpart to the probability we calculated is much higher For the diﬀerence between 4He and 3He, it is implausible that the origin is thermal – the natural abundance of 4He is 99.9998% and 3He is 0.0002%, whereas the concentration of H2 in the atmosphere is 10% of 4He. The reason for the disparity in the two helium isotopes appears to be the complicated reactions in the production of nuclei in the ﬁrst twenty minutes after the Big Bang, but hard to isolate a particular aspect. Problem 5.8 Counterpart to equipartition for diﬀerent potential shapes The Boltzmann factor for Vn(x) is exp (−V0|x| n kbT ) . So the normalised probability for the particle being x0 ≤ x ≤ x0 + dx, p(x)dx, is p(x) dx = exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) dx ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) dx . It is convenient to deﬁne the quantity Zn: Zn = ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp (−V0|x| n kbT ) . And the average value for the potential energy is ⟨Vn⟩ = ∫ ∞ −∞ dx V0|x| np(x) = ∫ ∞ −∞ dx V0|x| n exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) dx ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) dx . (i) −∂ ln Zn ∂β = − 1 Zn ∂Zn ∂β = − 1 Zn ∂ ∂β ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp (−βV0|x| n) dx = − 1 Zn ∫ ∞ −∞ dx [−V0|x| n] exp (−βV0|x| n) dx = ⟨Vn⟩ (ii) If y = (βV0)1/n x ⇒ dx = dy (βV0) −1/n . 5 KINETIC THEORY – SOLUTIONS 6 Then: Zn = ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp (−V0|x| n kbT ) dx = (βV0) −1/n ∫ ∞ −∞ dye−|y|n = (βV0) −1/n I0 (5.3) Note I0 is a pure number. (iii) Now we use Eq. (5.3) ln Zn = − 1 n ln (βV0) + ln I0 ⇒ −∂ ln Zn ∂β = 1 n 1 βV0 V0 = 1 nkbT . For n = 2 we obtain the harmonic oscillator and get the usual Equipartition theorem. (iv) For the \"ﬂat Earth\" gravitational potential V (z) = mgz, we use z ≥ 0 and get the same answer ie ⟨V1⟩ = kbT . Problem 5.9 A two-level heat engine – magnetic cooling The probabilities for the energy levels E± = ±µH are (deﬁning β = 1/(kbT )): p(E±) = e∓βµH e−βµH + eβµH . This implies the magnetisation is M (T, H) = µp(E−) − µp(E+) = µ sinh(βµH) cosh(βµH) = µ tanh(βµH) . (5.4) This plays the role of the equation of state with the correspondence M ↔ p and H ↔ V , where H and V are the external variables which are controlled and M and p are the responses of the system. The internal energy, U (T, H) is similarly U (T, H) = E+p(E+) + E−p(E−) = µHp(E+) − µHp(E−) = −M (T, H)H (5.5) Turning now to the thermodynamic cycle in Fig. (5.2) 1. Since we know M (T, H) from Eq. (5.4), we may invert to obtain: β1µH1 = tanh -1(M1/µ) ⇒ kbT1 = µH1 tanh-1(M1/µ) . (5.6) 5 KINETIC THEORY – SOLUTIONS 7 Figure 5.2: A magnetic refrigeration cycle. 2. The internal energy is ∆U (T, H2) = −H2M (T1, H1) + H1M (T1, H1) = −(H2 − H1)M (T1, H1) . 3. The temperature may be deduced as before – the magnetisation has not changed, but the ﬁeld has so kbT2 = µH2 tanh-1(M1/µ) > kbT1 . (So this is like the adiabatic compression of a gas in the refrigeration cycle.) 4. Letting the two-level system come intro equilibrium at T3, we see: M2(T3, H2) = µ tanh(β3µH2) . The change in U (T, H) on stage 2⃝ is: ∆U = −M2H2 + M1H2 = −(M2 − M1)H2 < 0 . 5. Reducing the ﬁeld adiabatically to H1, we ﬁnd that the temperature is: kbT4 = µH1 tanh-1(M2/µ) = µH1 tanh -1 [tanh { µH2 kbT3 }] = kbT3 H1 H2 < kbT3 . 6. And in turn since M2 > M1, T4 < T1 and so the two-level system will absorb heat from the system at T1. 7. The cycle is refrigerating as heat is absorbed from the system at T1 and heat is deposited at T3 after work has been done. 8. The isotherms are shown in Fig. (5.3) . 5 KINETIC THEORY – SOLUTIONS 8 Figure 5.3: Magnetic isotherms. Problem 5.10 Self-diﬀusion constant for an almost ideal gas We employ the same logic as in section 10 to determine the self diﬀusion constant, D, of an almost ideal gas. We deﬁne the concentration of the atomic species as n(y), then experimentally we ﬁnd the number crossing a plane of area A per unit time, dN dt = −D ∂n ∂y A . Then the concentrations on the diﬀerent planes (see diagrams in section 10), For P : n(y + λ) ≃ n + ∂n ∂y λ For Q: n(y − λ) ≃ n − ∂n ∂y λ . So the net ﬂux of particles per unit time through the middle plane is (they are only \"carrying themselves now, so no factor of mass, m, or speciﬁc heat: ˙N = −2A⟨v+ y ⟩λ∂n ∂y , (5.7) So comparing with the equation deﬁning D, we see that D = 2λ⟨v+ y ⟩ = 2⟨v+ y ⟩ πnr2 0 .","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
