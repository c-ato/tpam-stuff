Hence, if any two functions, y1(x, t) and y2(x, t) are the solutions of the wave equation, their sum is also a solution. superposition Standing Waves What happens if a sinusoidal wave is reflected at a fixed end of a string?: standing wav e We can derive a wave function for the standing wave by adding y1(x, t) and y2(x, t) for two waves with equal amplitude, period and wavelength travelling in opposite directions. (page 493 Young) Incident wave: travels from right to left Reflected wave: travels from left to right Waves reflected from a fixed end is inverted, hence change of sign for amplitude. We now add the two waves together.

Note: standing waves are also solutions of the wave-equationStanding waves; String with fixed ends. normal modes x=0 x=L y What standing waves can we have? superposition What conclusions can you make about the energy on the string? Standing Wave Frequency Each of the frequencies corresponds to a normal mode of the system.Resonanceglass For each normal mode, the corresponding frequency is also called the resonant frequency. What happens if you drive/excite a system at its resonant frequency? Basics of sound waves Note: if the boundary conditions are different then we get a different solution for the standing waves. E.g. String with one end free. Standing waves of sound First harmonic L=1/4l1, f1=v/4L 3rd harmonic: L=3/4l3, f3=3v/4L=3f1 5 th harmonic: L=5/4l5, f5=5v/4L=5f1 Not practical for string instruments: High Tension not possible, only low f. Where are the 2nd, 4 th harmonics? Even harmonics do not exist!

Know how to add two travelling waves to make a standing wave. 2. Understand what is a normal mode and how to obtain the frequency of a normal mode. 3. Boundary conditions causing the missing harmonics. 4. Energy in a standing wave.
