Q Conduction ሶ𝑄 for a small section dx of the rod depends on: 1) Temperature change d𝑇 of the small section 2) Cross-sectional area of the conductor, A 3) The “thermal conductivity” of the rod, κ (metals better at transferring heat than insulators, for example) units of W m-1 K-1 T1 T2 L Cross-sectional area A ሶ𝑄 = κ𝐴 d𝑇 d𝑥 Can show that ⅆ𝑇 ⅆ𝑥 = 𝑇2−𝑇1 𝐿 Fourier’s Law Newton’s law of cooling seemingly obeyed! Breakdown of Newton’s law of cooling If for ሶ𝑄 = κ𝐴 𝑇2−𝑇1 𝐿 we find that κ varies with temperature, Newton’s law of cooling (direct proportionality between temperature difference and rate of flow of heat) is no longer true Thermal conductivity due to two sources: movement of electrons or movement of phonons https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/330158/why-does-the- thermal-conductivity-of-pure-metals-decrease-with-increase-in-tem Thermal conductivity Material Thermal conductivity (κ) (W m-1 K-1) Diamond (natural) 2200 Copper 400 Air 0.02 Aerogel 0.003 Diamond’s rigidity is the cause of its high thermal conductivity High frequency vibrations (phonons) are able to propagate through the material Thermal conductivity Material Thermal conductivity (κ) (W m-1 K-1) Diamond 1000 Copper 400 Air 0.02 Aerogel 0.003 Thermal conductivity Material Thermal conductivity (κ) (W m-1 K-1) Diamond 1000 Copper 400 Air 0.02 Aerogel 0.003 Can also define Thermal resistivity ρ = 1/κ Thermal conductance K = κA/L Thermal resistance R = L /(κA) More complicated conduction cases T0 T1 T2 Pb (L1) Au (L2) Thermal resistances add like electrical resistances in series!
