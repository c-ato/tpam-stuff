In a resistor, the current and the voltage are in phase. Thus, if we choose the current to be a sine wave of angular frequency, ω, then the voltage will also be a pure sine wave of the same angular frequency. The average power is found by integrating this function over one complete period. → standard double-angle formula substitution. The average of a sine or cosine over one period is zero, so only the first term in the final integral contributes. p = iv = I sin ( wt )V sin (wt ) = I V (sin (wt )) 2 〈 p〉 = 1 T ∫0 T p dt = 1 T ∫0 T I V (sin(wt )) 2 dt = 1 T ∫0 T I V 2 (1 − cos(2wt ))dt 〈 p〉 = IV 2 = I √2 ⋅ V √2 = I rms⋅V rms EC_10.10 Power in a.c. circuits EC_10.11 Power dissipation in a capacitor & inductor In a capacitor or an inductor, there is a 90 degrees phase difference between the voltage and the current, which must also be taken into account. In the case of the capacitor, the voltage lags the current by 90 degrees. Integrate the product using a double angle formula. This time, there is no constant term in the final integral and since the average of a sine function over one period is zero, the capacitor does not consume any power. p = i v = I sin (ω t )V sin ( ω t − π 2 ) = I sin (ω t )(−V cos(ω t)) ⟨ p ⟩ = 1 T ∫ 0 T p dt = 1 T ∫ 0 T − I V sin (ω t )cos(ω t )dt = 1 T ∫ 0 T − I V 2 sin (2 ω t )dt = 0 EC_10.12 Power in a.c. circuits EC_10.13 Power in a.c. circuits EC_10.14 Power dissipation: resistive/reactive circuits How do we calculate the average dissipated power in circuits with both resistive and reactive components? The general approach is the same, only this time we don’t know exactly what the phase angle, φ, will be. If we take the current to be our reference then the voltage will either lag or lead by φ (it doesn’t matter which). Integrate the product using a double angle formula. The first term contains a sine-squared, which (in comparison to power in resistive circuits) has an average value of 1/2. The second term contains the product of sine and cosine, which has an average value of zero. only the first term contributes.→ p = i v = I sin(ω t)V sin (ω t+ϕ ) 〈 p〉 = 1 T ∫0 T p dt = 1 T ∫0 T I V (sin 2(ω t) cos ϕ +sin(ω t)cos (ω t )sin ϕ )dt 〈 p〉 = I V 2 cosϕ = I rms V rms cos ϕ power factor","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
