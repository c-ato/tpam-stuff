Solid Liquid Gas Temperature Question: How does pressure fit in? Phase diagram: Pressure vs temperature Chemical notation 12C 3+ Mass number (proton + neutron number) Chemical symbol (denotes proton number) Charge state (excess/missing electrons) CH4 Number of atoms per molecule An atom is a neutrally charged particle made up of a nucleus and orbited by electrons A nucleus consists of a mixture of nucleons (i.e. protons and neutrons) ‚Äì isotopes are nuclei with a different number of neutrons but the same number of protons An ion is a charged atom, in which the number of electrons differs from the number of protons -> come in two forms, cations and anions A molecule is a collection of atoms that are loosely bound together by chemical bonds (in which they share electrons) 12C 2H2 1H 2H 3H 3He (metres) 10-0 (metres) 101010-10 10-0 20 m https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Periodic_table_large.svg/2560px-Periodic_table_large.svg.png 3,500 nuclei, with predictions for 7,000 Number of neutronsNumber of protonsAtomic sizes How does the size of the atom vary? As we add more electrons, it would make sense for the radius of the atom to increase accordingly to fit in the extra electrons. Does it? Atom size and properties mostly determined by the outermost electron Ionisation and atom size https://wisc.pb.unizin.org/app/uploads/sites/564/h5p/content/31/images/image-5cdefc04046e6.png https://www.ck12.org/c/chemistry/periodic-trends%3A-ionization-energy/lesson/Periodic-Trends-Ionization-Energy-CHEM/ Atoms have approximately the same atomic radius and ionisation energy, regardless of number of protons and electrons Nucleus size Nuclear size does increase as A increases ‚Äì how might you expect the nuclear radius, R, to change with A? Remember that increasing A adds nucleons in all 3 dimensions! ùëÖ = ùëü0ùê¥1/3 where r0 is 1.2 x 10-15 m Masses‚Ä¶ Masses for atoms and molecules are usually given in amu (atomic mass units), defined as 1/12 of the mass of a 12C atom 1 amu = 1.66 x 10-27 kg The atomic mass of 12C is hence 12 amu‚Ä¶ but the masses of the proton and neutron are 1.007 amu and 1.009 amu respectively. When nucleons come together to form nuclei, mass is converted into binding energy! ‚Ä¶ and moles A mole (mol) is a base unit used to defined amount of substance by the number of atoms in that substance. 1 mole of a substance is defined as consisting of NA = 6.022 x 1023 atoms or molecules, unthinkably large‚Ä¶ (size of observable universe ~ 1027 m). NA is known as Avagadro‚Äôs number, defined by how many atoms are in 12 grams of 12C Masses and moles Amount of substance (moles) = Number of particles ùëÅùê¥ For atoms: Moles = Mass (g) Atomic mass For molecules: Moles = Mass (g) Molar mass For gases: 1 mol occupies 22.4 dm3 (or 22.4 litres) at standard temperature (273.15 K, 0¬∞C) and pressure (105 Pa, 1atm) [STP], regardless of gas Summary ‚Ä¢ We have discussed the difference between atoms, nuclei, ions, molecules and isotopes ‚Ä¢ Defined the unit of amount of substance, the mole, and how to calculate it for a given substance for both its mass and the number of particles that constitute it ‚Ä¢ Discussed the size of the atom and its surprising invariance despite number of electrons","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
