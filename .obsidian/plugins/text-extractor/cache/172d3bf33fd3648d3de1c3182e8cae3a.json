Introduction to Probability Definition The conditional probability of 𝐴 given 𝐵 is written P(𝐴|𝐵) and defined by 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 ≡ 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 ≠ 0 The fraction of 𝐵 where both 𝐴 and 𝐵 happen. Introduction to Probability Given that B occurred, what is the probability that A occurred? 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 = Number of events in 𝐴 and 𝐵 Number of events in 𝐵 A Ω BA ∩ 𝐵 Is it a probability? Introduction to Probability Assume 𝑃 is valid, and define 𝑄 𝐴 𝐵 ≡ 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) 1. 𝑄 a 𝐵 = 𝑃 a∩𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) ≥ 0 and only 0 a ∩ 𝐵 = ∅ 2. 𝑄 Ω 𝐵 = 𝑃 Ω∩𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) = 𝑃 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 = 1 3. Finally is 𝑄 a1 ∪ 𝑎2 𝐵 = 𝑄 a1 𝐵 + 𝑄 𝑎2 𝐵 if a1 ∩ 𝑎2 = ∅? Is it a probability (2)? Introduction to Probability 𝑎1 ∪ 𝑎2 ∩ 𝐵 𝑎1 ∩ 𝐵 ∪ (𝑎2 ∩ 𝐵) 𝑎2 𝑎1 𝐵 𝑎2 𝑎1 𝐵 𝑄 a1 ∪ 𝑎2 𝐵 = 𝑃 a1 ∪ 𝑎2 ∩ 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) = 𝑃 (𝑎1∩ 𝐵) ∪ (𝑎2∩ 𝐵) 𝑃(𝐵) (𝑎1∩ 𝐵) and (𝑎2∩ 𝐵) are themselves disjoint → 𝑃 𝑎1 ∩ 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) + 𝑃 𝑎2 ∩ 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) So 𝑄 a1 ∪ 𝑎2 𝐵 = 𝑄 a1 𝐵 + 𝑄 𝑎2 𝐵 if 𝑎1 ∩ 𝑎2 = ∅ 𝑎1𝑎2 𝐵 Example If 𝑃 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = 0.4, P A = 0.2 and P B = 0.3, what is P 𝐴|B and P B|𝐴 ? Introduction to Probability 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 𝐵 − 𝑃 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = 0.2 + 0.3 − 0.4 = 0.1 → 𝑃 𝐴|𝐵 = 0.1 0.3 = 1 3 → 𝑃 𝐵|𝐴 = 0.1 0.2 = 1 2 Example You toss a coin 7 times. Given that at least 6 heads were observed, what is the probability that the total number of heads was 7? Use that the probability is proportional to the size of the set. Guesses: 1 1 2 1 6 1 7 1 8 other? Introduction to Probability Let 𝐴𝑛 be the even that 𝑛 heads observed. 𝐴7 = {𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻} 𝐴6 = {𝑇𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻, 𝐻𝑇𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 … } We have that either 𝐴6 or 𝐴7 occurred and we want 𝑃(𝐴7 𝐴6 ∪ 𝐴7 = 𝐴7 𝐴6 + |𝐴7| = 1 8 Reconditioning Reconditioning We can use 𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) to work out 𝑃(𝐵|𝐴). Introduction to Probability 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 → 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) 𝑃 𝐵 𝐴 = 𝑃 𝐵 ∩ 𝐴 𝑃 𝐴 → 𝑃 𝐵 ∩ 𝐴 = 𝑃 𝐵 𝐴 𝑃(𝐴) 𝐵 ∩ 𝐴 = 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 → 𝑃 𝐵 𝐴 = 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 𝑃(𝐴) Example A rare cold-like disease has symptoms with probability 0.95. The probability of having the disease is 0.0001. The probability of having the cold-like symptoms is 0.4. Given that someone has the symptoms, what is the probability they have the disease? Introduction to Probability Let 𝑠 be symptoms and 𝑑 be has disease 𝑃 𝑠 𝑑 = 0.95 𝑃 𝑑 = 0.0001 𝑃 𝑠 = 0.4 𝑃 𝑑 𝑠 = 𝑃 𝑠 𝑑 𝑃 𝑑 𝑃(𝑠) = 0.95 × 0.0001 0.4 ≈ 0.0002 Class Example An email spam filter works by looking for keywords. If: 1. 50% of emails are spam 2. 10% of spam contain “refinance” 3. 6% of all emails contain “refinance” What is the probability of an email being spam if it contains “refinance”? Introduction to Probability 𝑃 Spam = 1 2 𝑃 \"refinance\"|Spam = 1 10 𝑃 \"refinance\" = 6 100 → 𝑃 Spam|\"refinance\" = 𝑃 \"refinance\"|Spam 𝑃 Spam 𝑃 \"refinance\" = 1 10 × 1 2 6 100 = 5 6 Statistical Independence Independence If knowing that 𝐵 happened has no impact on 𝐴 then 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 = 𝑃(𝐴) In which case 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴|𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 𝑃(𝐵) This is called statistical independence. 𝑃 𝑥1 ∩ 𝑥2 ∩ ⋯ ∩ 𝑥𝑁 = 𝑃 𝑥1 𝑃 𝑥2 … 𝑃(𝑥𝑁) Introduction to Probability Independence and Mutually Exclusive Introduction to Probability Mutually Exclusive 𝑃 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 𝐵 Comes from set theory Statistical Independence 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 𝑃 𝐵 Comes from conditional probabilityA Ω B Example The probability of rain at the weekend is 25% for Saturday and 25% for Sunday. If the rain is assumed to be independent on each day, is the probability of rain over the weekend 50%? Introduction to Probability Remember 𝑃 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 = 𝑃 𝑒1 + 𝑃 𝑒2 − 𝑃(𝑒1 ∩ 𝑒2) 𝑃 𝑒1 ∩ 𝑒2 = 𝑃 𝑒1 𝑃(𝑒2) 𝑃 Rain = 1 4 + 1 4 − 1 4 × 1 4 = 7 16 Class Example In a garden there are 100 flowers. 40 of them are pretty, and 10 are rare. 4 are both rare and pretty. Is rare and pretty independent in the garden? Introduction to Probability 𝑃 pretty = 40 100 𝑃 rare = 10 100 𝑃 pretty ∩ rare = 40 100 × 10 100 = 4 100 Yes! Summary 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 ≡ 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) If events are independent then 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 𝑃(𝐵) And for many events: 𝑃 𝑒1 ∩ 𝑒2 ∩ ⋯ 𝑒𝑁 = 𝑃 𝑒1 𝑃 𝑒2 … 𝑃 𝑒𝑁 Introduction to Probability Examples Examples The probability of rain on Wednesday is 0.4 The probability it rains on Thursday is 0.6 The probability that both days are not raining is 0.2 What is the probability it rains on Thursday given that it rained on Wednesday? Note: 𝑃 𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐 = 1 − 𝑃(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) Introduction to Probability Let 𝑊 be rain on Wednesday and 𝑇 for Thursday. 𝑃 𝑊 = 0.4, 𝑃 𝑇 = 0.6, 𝑃 ഥ𝑊 ∩ ത𝑇 = 0.2 We want 𝑃(𝑇|𝑊) 𝑃 ഥ𝑊 ∩ ത𝑇 = 1 − 𝑃 𝑊 ∪ 𝑇 → 𝑃 𝑊 ∪ 𝑇 = 0.8 Then 𝑃 𝑊 ∩ 𝑇 = 𝑃 𝑊 + 𝑃 𝑇 − 𝑃 𝑊 ∪ 𝑇 = 0.2 And so 𝑃 𝑇 𝑊 = 𝑃 𝑊 ∩ 𝑇 𝑃 𝑊 = 0.2 0.4 = 1 2 Class Example Polygraphs are used to screen people. Each individual either tells the truth or lies. The (imperfect) polygraph returns 0 if it thinks the person is lying, or 1 for truthfulness, with the following probability: 𝑃 1 Truth = 0.86 People don’t lie commonly, approximately 1% of the time and the probability the machine returns 0 is 0.15. What is the probability that the polygraph wrongly accuses someone of lying? Introduction to Probability We have P Lies = 0.01; P 0 = 0.15; P 1 Truth = 0.86 P Truth|0 = P 0|Truth 𝑃 Truth 𝑃(0) = (1 − 0.86) × (1 − 0.01) 0.15 ≈ 0.92 Example An insurance company has the following data about accidents If an accident happens, what is the probability (according to this data) of the accident involving a young person? Introduction to Probability Number Of Accidents Number of Journeys Young 10 1000 Old 1 500 Let 𝐴 be accident and 𝑌 be young. We want P Y 𝐴 = 𝑃 𝑌∩𝐴 𝑃(𝐴) The probability of an accident is 𝑃 𝐴 = 11 1500 𝑃 𝑌 ∩ 𝐴 = 10 1500 So P Y 𝐴 = 10 11","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
