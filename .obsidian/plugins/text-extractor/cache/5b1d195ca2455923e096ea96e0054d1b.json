In the circuit shown below: (a) What is the initial battery current immediately after the switch is closed? (b) What is the battery current a long time after the switch is closed? (c) What is the maximum voltage across the capacitor? (d) If the switch has been closed for a long time and is then opened, deduce an expression for the current through the 600 k resistor as a function of time. (e) What is the energy dissipated in the 600 k resistor after the switch is opened? (Note that 1 k = 103 ; 1 M = 10 6 ; 1 F = 10--6 F.) 50 V 1.2 M Ω 2.5 μF 600 k Ω + –","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
