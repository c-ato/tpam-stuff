Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. No calculator is permitted in this examination. Page 1 Turn over 1RA Real Analysis 1. (a) Let f : R → R be a function and α, ℓ ∈ R. [8] (i) Deﬁne what it means that lim x→α f (x) = ℓ. (ii) By directly using the deﬁnition of limit from (i), show that lim x→1 3x + 2 = 5.

(ii) By directly using the deﬁnition of derivative from (i), ﬁnd the derivative of the function f (x) = x3 at the point x = π. (c) Find the following limits. Show your detailed work. You can use any results discussed in lectures, provided you clearly state what you are using. [4] (i) lim x→0 sin 7x sin 4x , (ii) lim x→∞ 6x2 + 8x + 9 x2 + 2x − 6 (d) Find the derivatives of the following functions. Show your detailed work. You can use any results discussed in lectures, provided you clearly state what you are using. [4] (i) f (x) = cos x + ln x + x4 , (ii) f (x) = cos x − 1 ex + 1 (e) Let f (x) = 2x3 − 6x2 − 18x + 7.

(a) For the vectors a = (1, 2, 4), b = (v1, v2, v3) and c = (1, 2, 3) determine (i) a + b, (ii) a · b, (iii) a × b, and (iv) the angle θ between a and c You may leave your answer to (a)(iv) in the form θ = cos−1(x) or sin −1(x), where x is a real number that you have determined. [8] (b) Let z1 = − √ 2 2 (1 + i) and z2 = 2ei 3π 4 . Determine (i) z1 in modulus argument form giving the principal value of the argument, and z2 in the form x + iy, (ii) z1 + z2 in the form x + iy, (iii) z1z −1 2 in modulus argument form giving the principal value of the argument, and (iv) z29 1 in exponential form giving the principal value of the argument. [8] (c) (i) Use the Gaussian elimination method to obtain a reduced echelon form and deter- mine the solution set for the following system of simultaneous linear equations: 3x + 2y − z = 4 2x − y + 2z = 10 x − 3y − 4z = 5. (ii) Let a be a real number. Use your working from (c)(i) to ﬁnd a solution of the following system of simultaneous linear equations: 3x + 2y − z = 11a 2x − y + 2z = 0 x − 3y − 4z = 0.
