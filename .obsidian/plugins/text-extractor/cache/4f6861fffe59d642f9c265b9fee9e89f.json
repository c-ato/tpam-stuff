Therefore the answers are: question (1.1) horizontal to the right, (e); [2 marks] questions (1.2) vertically up, (a) [2 marks] Problem 2. Two charges q1 and q2 are placed at the vertices of a right-angled triangle. The value of the charge q1 is |q1| = 15µ C, but its sign is not know. For the charge q2, both the sign and the magnitude are not known. The resulting electric ﬁeld ⃗E produced by the two charges at P is in the negative y direction (no x component). 1. The two charges q1 and q2 must be negative in order for the electric ﬁeld to be in the negative y direction, with no horizontal component. [2 marks] 2. The horizontal component of ⃗E is zero. Therefore: E1x + E2x = 0 1 4πϵ0 [ q1 r2 1 cos θ1 − q2 r2 2 cos θ2 ] = 0 q2 = q1 ( r2 r1 )2 cos θ1 cos θ2 1 and therefore: q2 = q1 ( r2 r1 )2 cos θ1 cos θ2 = q1 ( r2 r1 ) = −15µC 12 cm 5 cm = −36µC [2 marks] (2 marks for correct answer, any method, 1 mark if answer is wrong but method is correct) 3. The electric ﬁeld has component only in the (negative) y direction, and its value is: Ey = E1y + E2y = 1 4πϵ0 [ q1 r2 1 sin θ1 + q2 r2 2 sin θ2 ] and sin θ1 = r2/13 etc. so: Ey = −8.9 × 10 9 [ 15 × 10 −6 (5 × 10−2)2 ( 12 13 ) + 36 × 10 −6 (12 × 10−2)2 ( 5 13 )] N C −1 = −5.8 × 10 7 N C −1 [2 marks] (2 marks for correct answer, any method, 1 mark if answer is wrong but method is correct) 2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
