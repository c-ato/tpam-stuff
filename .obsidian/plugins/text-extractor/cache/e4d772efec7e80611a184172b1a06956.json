Use it to derive Snell’s law for light transmitting across the interface between two media ni sin θi = nt sin θt , where the symbols have their usual meaning. [5] (b) The diagram below shows an object at P forms a real image at P ′ inside the glass sphere of radius r. Which direction will the image move under the following actions? i. Increase r. ii. Increase the index of refraction n. iii. Increase the object distance. iv. Decrease r v. Decrease the index of refraction. P\" P’\" s\" s’\" n\"n=1\" r\" [5] (c) A small light bulb is suspended 250 cm above the surface of the water (n = 1.33) in a swimming pool. The bottom of the pool is a large mirror. 250$cm$ 200$cm$ Mirror$ Air$ Water$ Bulb$ i. When viewed under water, how far does the bulb appear from the surface of the water? How far is the image of the bulb behind the mirror? Use ray diagrams to back up your calculations/analysis. [7] A37467 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR ii. When viewed from air, how far does the image of the bulb appear behind the mirror? Ignore the reﬂection at the surface of the water and hence ignore multiple reﬂections. [Hint: Consider the following processes: 1) refraction at the air/water interface; 2) reﬂection by the mirror; 3) The image behind the mirror subject to refraction at the water/air interface] [8] You may ﬁnd one of the following equations useful: 1 s+ 1 s′ = 1 f , n1 s +n2 s′ = n2 − n1 r , 1 f = (n−1) ( 1 r1 − 1 r2 ) , 1 s+ 1 s′ = 2 r A37467 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR Part B (a) Use Huygen’s principle to show that for single-slit diffraction, a dark fringe occurs when sin θ = mλ a , where m = ±1, ±2, ..., and a is the width of the slit. [5] (b) In a double-slit interference experiment, the spacing between the two slits of negligible width is d and the distance to the viewing screen is L with L ≫ d. Treating the two slits as two sources of identical in-phase waves, show with the help of a sketch that the mth bright fringe occurs at position: ym = mλL d , m = 0, ±1, ±2, ... [5] (c) A beam of parallel coherent light of wavelength λ is incident normally on a set of N parallel slits. The slits have negligible width and each is seperated from its neighbour by a distance d. Show that the resulting intensity of light emitted in direction θ is given by I(θ) = I0 sin 2 N δ 2 sin 2 δ 2 , where I0 is the intensity from one slit alone and δ = 2πd sin θ λ in the usual notation. [5] If the incident light consists of two wavelengths λ and λ+∆λ, where ∆λ ≪ λ, show that the angular separation of these two wavelengths in the mth order is ∆θ = ∆λ √( d m)2 − λ2 . [5] The ability of the slits to seperate different wavelengths of light according to the above equation makes the set of slits as a spectrometer. Describe, qualitatively, how the property of such a spectrometer depends on the number of slits. [5] A37467 Page 6 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 6. EITHER (Part A) (a) The time-independent Schr ¨odinger equation (TISE) in one dimension is − ℏ 2 2m d 2ψ(x) dx2 + V (x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x), where the symbols have their usual meaning. State the assumptions upon which the Schr ¨odinger equation is based. [4] (b) Show that the spatial wave function ψ(x) = A exp(ikx) is a solution of the TISE when the potential function has a constant value, i.e. V (x) = V0, where V0 is a positive contant. [2] (c) A particle of mass, m, and energy, E, moving in the positive x-direction is incident upon a downward potential step at x = 0. The potential function is V (x) = 0 for x < 0 and V (x) = −V0 for x ≥ 0. i. Given that the wave function ψ(x) = A exp(ikx) describes a particle moving in the positive x-direction, write down, with justiﬁcation, general solutions of the TISE for each of the regions x < 0 and x ≥ 0. [4] ii. Write down an expression for the wavenumber in each of these regions in terms of E and the value of the potential function. What can you say about the momentum of the particle in the two regions? [3] iii. Explain why the wave function, and the gradient of the wave function, must be continuous at x = 0. [4] iv. Use the boundary conditions given in part iii. to ﬁnd an expression for the ratio of the reﬂected and incident amplitudes of the wave function in the region x < 0 in terms of the wavenumbers in each region. Hence, ﬁnd the probability of the particle being reﬂected when when E = 0.1V0. [8] A37467 Page 7 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR (Part B) (a) Brieﬂy describe the Geiger-Marsden scattering experiment and Rutherford’s interpretation of the results. Explain why Rutherford’s model of the atom is inconsistent with classical physics. How did Bohr’s model resolve this inconsistency? [5] (b) Consider an atom with atomic number Z, from which Z − 1 electrons have been removed. In the Bohr model, the centripetal force on an electron of mass m and velocity v, at a radius r from the nucleus, is given by mv2 r = Ze 2 4πϵ0r2 . i. Show that if the orbital length is an integer multiple, n, of the de Broglie wavelength of the electron, the orbital radii are given by rn = n 2a0 Z , where a0 = h 2ϵ0 πme2 is the Bohr radius. [5] ii. Hence, demonstrate that the total energy of the remaining electron is proportional to Z 2. (You may assume that the electron is non-relativistic.) [3] iii. Given that the ionisation energy of hydrogen in its ground state is −13.6 eV, calculate the energy of the photon emitted when an excited electron in a singly-ionised helium atom (He+, Z = 2) makes a transition from the n = 6 state to the n = 2 state. Determine whether this photon could be absorbed by a hydrogen atom in its ground state. [6] (c) A unknown material is exposed to a source of high energy photons. Lower energy photons with a characteristic energy of 8.04 keV, assumed to be Kα X-rays, are isotropically emitted by the unknown material. State what process is involved and determine whether the unknown material is cobolt (Z = 27), nickel (Z = 28) or copper (Z = 29).
