If you answer more than two questions, credit will only be given for the best two answers. The approximate allocation of marks to each part of a question is shown in brackets [ ]. All symbols have their usual meanings. Calculators may be used in this examination but must not be used to store text. Calculators with the ability to store text should have their memories deleted prior to the start of the examination. A formula sheet and a table of physical constants and units that may be required will be found at the end of this question paper. Page 1 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR Answer two questions. If you answer more than two questions, credit will only be given for the best two answers. 1. A dissipative oscillator is described by the equation d 2x dt2 + x = η dx dt cos x (1) where η is a variable parameter. (a) Employ the position, x, and the momentum, p ≡ dx dt , to ﬁnd the fundamental equation. [3] (b) Solve for the trajectory in the limit η=0, and include the time dependence. [5] (c) What do you think happens when η is non-zero but tiny? [1] (d) Employ the position, x, and the analogue momentum, q ≡ 1 η dx dt − sin x, to ﬁnd a second fundamental equation. [4] (e) Solve for the behaviour of q when η=∞. [2] (f) Solve for the behaviour of x when η=∞, being very careful to consider q < 1, q > 1, q = 0 and q = 1 independently. You may like to rescale time with T = ηt and solve for x(T ). [Hint: You may ﬁnd the transformation s = tan x 2 useful.] [9] (g) What do you think happens when η is ﬁnite but huge? [1] A19919 Page 2 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 2. Consider the map xn+1 = r (xn + 1 xn ) (2) where r is a control parameter. (a) Find all the possible 1-cycles and establish for which range of control parameter they are stable. [8] (b) Find all the possible 2-cycles and establish for which range of control parameter they are stable. [13] (c) Find the attractor when it is either a 1-cycle or a 2-cycle.

A map is deﬁned by yn+1 = M [yn] with M [y] = 2y y ∈ [ 0, 1 2 ] (3) M [y] = 3 − 4y y ∈ [1 2, 3 4 ] (4) M [y] = 8y − 6 y ∈ [3 4, 7 8 ] (5) M [y] = 8 − 8y y ∈ [7 8, 1] . (6) (a) Depict this map on the interval y ∈ [0, 1]. [4] (b) Employ base 2 to ﬁnd a useful representation for this map. [6] (c) Demonstrate that binary numbers of the form 0.a1a2a3b1b2b2c1c2c3... where the triples are restricted to x1x2x3 ∈ {000, 111, 010, 101} are preserved by this map. [5] (d) Find a sequence of cycles of this form, starting from a 1-cycle and reaching a 6-cycle. [6] (e) Convert your binary cycles into fractions and verify that they are indeed cycles by direct application of the original map.
