A quantum mechanical wavefunction is given by ψ(x) = e − x 2 0 ≤ x < ∞ The probability density is related to the wavefunction through ρ(x) = |ψ(x)| 2. (a) Show that this wavefunction is normalised. [4] (b) Define the expectation value, ⟨x⟩, for a continuous distribution. [3] (c) Calculate the expectation value of position for this wavefunction. [3] 2. A discrete distribution is given by P (x) = c x2 x = {1, 2, . . .} (a) Find the normalising constant, c. [4] (b) Define the expectation value, ⟨x⟩, for a discrete distribution.

In a multiple choice question with k possible answers, a student either knows the answer or does not. When they do not know the answer they guess. Let the probability that a student actually knows the answer be p. (a) What is the probability they get the correct answer if they guess? [2] (b) Given that a student gets the question correct, what is the probability that they knew the answer? [5] (c) The odds ratio of an event is defined as O(p) ≡ p/(1 − p). Show that as k → ∞ the probability of knowing the answer given the student was correct can be written as P (Knowing|Correct) ≈ 1 − O(1 − p) k and show that this requires that p is not close to 0. [3] You may find the following approximation helpful 1 1 + ax ≈ 1 − ax ax ≪ 1 4. In an inertial frame Σ event B occurs after event A. The events take place at the same position and the time interval between the events is T . (a) By performing Lorentz transformation to the frame Σ ′ which moves in the positive x-direction with velocity v with respect to Σ, find the time interval T ′ between the events in the frame Σ′. (b) Calculate the interval ∆s2 AB between the events. Explain why it is invariant under Lorentz transformation. Use the invariant interval to calculate the distance D′ between the events in the frame Σ ′. [10] A35211 Page 3 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR SECTION 2 Answer two questions from this Section. If you answer more than two questions, credit will only be given for the best two answers. 5. Paul Atreides flies away from the planet Arrakis with speed V = 3c/5. After flying for τ = 2 years (in his own frame) he receives a radio message from Arrakis telling him that his mission cannot be funded anymore and he must return. Paul performs an immediate U-turn and heads back to Arrakis with the same speed. When approaching the planet he discovers that the landing and communication system of the spaceship are broken so he misses the landing. It takes him a while before he is able to repair the communication system and stop. He makes a distress video call to Arrakis which is received T = 13 years after the first message was sent. (a) Draw the Minkowski space-time diagram of Paul’s journey. Use the start event at the origin, E0 = (t0, x0) = (0, 0). Indicate i. the event E1 = (t1, x1) when the fist message is sent, ii. the event E2 = (t2, x2) when Paul receives it, iii. the event E3 = (t3, x3) when Paul stops and sends his message, iv. the event E4 = (t4, x4) when the Paul’s message is received on Arrakis. [6] (b) Give the definition of proper time. Using this definition or an appropriate Lorentz transformation calculate the space-time coordinates of the event E1 = (t1, x1). State the relativistic effect behind this calculation. [8] (c) Show that t3 = 10 years . [6] (d) Give the definition of relativistic interval between two events Ea = (ta, xa) and Eb = (tb, xb) and explain why it is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. By calculating relativistic interval intervals between E2 and E3 and using the results in parts (b) and (c) find how old Paul is on his video call if his journey started on his 20th birthday.

As a result a π meson with rest mass mπ = 140 Mev is created in addition to the protons. (a) Write down the momenta of the protons P1, P2 before the collision. [6] (b) Assuming an observer moves along the direction of the cosmic ray proton with velocity v write down the energy and momentum of each particle in the moving observer’s frame by using Lorentz transformation for energy and momentum. [8] (c) In the centre of mass frame the total momentum is zero. Show that the velocity v of the centre of mass frame is v = c √E1 − mpc2 E1 + mpc2 . [6] (d) Calculate the minimal (threshold) energy of the photon E1 in MeV for the pion production to take place. [10] A35211 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 7. Consider playing a game multiple times. The probability that you win the game is p. You decide that you will play this game until you have won r games, and then immediately stop. Note that this means you stop playing the game as soon as you have won r games, and so the process stops on a win. (a) What is the probability that you have to play two games in order to win once (r = 1)? [2] (b) What is the probability that you have to play n games in order to win once (r = 1)? [2] (c) You decide you want to win twice (r = 2). For the case n = 2 you require {win, win}. Write down the corresponding results for n = 3 and n = 4. [4] (d) What is the probability that you have to play n games to win twice? [2] (e) So far there have been r −1 wins after n−1 games, not necessarily ending with a win. The probability of this is P = (n − 1 r − 1 ) (1 − p) n−rpr−1 Therefore, what is the probability that you stop after playing n games with r wins? [4] (f) Use the above to show that ∞∑ n=r (n − 1)! (n − r)!(1 − p) n = (1 − p p )r (r − 1)! (Hint: distributions are normalised) [6] (g) What is ⟨n⟩? (Hint: use the above summation to aid you). [6] (h) Show that as p → 0, ⟨n⟩ → ∞ and interpret this.
