If it takes 4 minutes for the water to reach boiling point, how much longer will it take for the kettle to boil dry? [Speciﬁc heat capacity of water = 4.2 kJ K −1 kg −1. Latent heat of vaporisation of water = 2.26 MJ kg−1.] [5] 2. A classical system contains particles which can exist in only three states: one, A, with energy E = 0, and two states, B and C, with the same energy E = ϵ. The particles do not interact. If the system is at temperature T , what is the probability of a particle being observed: (i) with E = 0? [2] (ii) with E = ϵ? [2] (iii) as being in state C? [1] 3.

EITHER Part A A hypothetical diatomic molecule may be described by a potential : V0(r) = L2 r2 − Z 2 r , where r is the inter-atomic separation, with L and Z constants. (i) Sketch the potential V0(r), and indicate notable features. [5] (ii) Find the equilibrium separation of the atoms, r0, and the binding energy, ϵ0. [6] Now consider the molecule experiencing in addition a potential V1(r), such that the total potential is Vtot(r) = V0(r) + V1(r) where V1(r) = −Er , and E > 0 is a constant. (iii) Sketch Vtot(r) in the limits: (I) small E ; (II) large E . [4] (iv) Find the value of E , Ec(L, Z), where for E ≥ Ec, there is no minimum of Vtot(r) for r < ∞. [6] (v) Brieﬂy describe a physical situation where Vtot(r) might be appropriate. [4] A22259 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR Part B Consider n moles of an ideal gas initially at pressure p1 and with volume V1. All stages in the following cycle are performed sufﬁciently slowly that the gas remains in equilibrium. The ratio of the speciﬁc heats, Cp/C V , is γ. Compress the gas adiabatically until the volume is halved. (i) What is the ﬁnal pressure, p2, and temperature T2? [3] Now, reduce the pressure to p3 < p2 at constant volume. Then expand the gas adiabatically to the original volume, at pressure p4. Finally, increase the pressure, at constant volume, to p1. (ii) What is the pressure, p4, in terms of p3? [3] (iii) What is the total work, W tot on , performed on the gas in the cycle? [5] (iv) What is the total heat extracted from the gas, Q tot out? [3] (v) What is the value of W tot on if p2 − p3 → 0 and p1 − p4 → 0? [1] Consider a monatomic ideal gas in a cylindrical volume, subdivided into two cylindrical compartments by a circular partition of cross sectional area A and mass M , which moves without friction. No heat or particle transfer occurs between the two compartments, or with the cylinder’s exterior. Initially, the partition divides the cylinder into compartments of equal volume, V0, each containing an identical number of moles, n. (vi) What is the condition on the pressures in the compartments, p1 and p2, to ensure mechanical equilibrium of the partition? [1] The partition is displaced adiabatically by a small amount, x0 (x0A ≪ V0), along the axis of the cylinder and then released. (vii) Assuming the subsequent motion of the partition is sufﬁciently slow for the gas in both compartments to be always in equilibrium, determine the equation of motion for the partition. (Gravity may be neglected.) [7] (viii) Write down, and motivate, any criteria for the motion to be “sufﬁciently slow”. [2] A22259 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 7. EITHER Part A (a) A spherical shell, of radius R, has a total charge Q distributed uniformly over its surface, as shown in the diagram below. Derive expressions for the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld inside and outside of the sphere. Hence derive expressions for the electric potential, as a function of the distance from the centre, r, inside and outside of the sphere, assuming the potential tends to zero as the distance tends to inﬁnity. [6] Derive expressions for the capacitance of this sphere and the energy stored. [4] (b) A point charge, q, is located at a ﬁxed distance a from the centre of the spherical shell, where a > R. The point charge does not affect the charge distribution on the sphere. What is the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at the centre of the sphere now? [2] What is the magnitude of the force on the point charge? [4] If the shell shrinks to half its radius, without losing any charge, what happens to the force on the point charge? Explain your reasoning. [2] (c) In part (b), work must be done in order to shrink the spherical shell. The work done is balanced by a change in energy stored in the electric ﬁeld. Using the general expression for the energy density, uE, stored in an electric ﬁeld, E, derive an expression for the change in energy in the electric ﬁeld when the sphere shrinks to half its radius.

(You may assume the relative permeability, µr = 1 everywhere.) Use Ampere’s law to derive expressions for the magnetic ﬁeld at a distance r from the centre of the toroid for (i) r < a, (ii) a < r < b, and (iii) r > b when a current I ﬂows through the toroid. [9] (c) Derive an expression for the total energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld of the toroid. [10] A22259 Page 7 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 8.
