Questions are ranked in diﬃculty from A (basic) to C (challenging). (A) Question 1. Use the method demonstrated in the lectures to ﬁnd the inverse of the matrix A =    3 −5 7 0 5 0 1 0 2   . Check that your answer is correct. (A) Question 2. Use the method demonstrated in the lectures to ﬁnd the inverse of the matrix A =    i 1 + i 2 + i 0 1 − i i 0 0 2 − i    ∈ M33(C). (A) Question 3. Give the elementary matrix E that, when multiplied to the left of a 5 by 5 matrix A (i.e. E · A) will perform the following elementary row operation: (a) Swaps rows 3 and 5; (b) Divides row 2 by -3; (c) Adds 7 times row 2 to row 4. In each case, also give the inverse of the elementary matrix. (A) Question 4. Give the elementary matrix E that, when multiplied to the right of a 3 by 5 matrix A (i.e. A · E) will perform the following (elementary) column operation: (a) Swaps columns 1 and 4; (b) Multiply column 2 by 8; (c) Adds 2 times column 5 to column 3. In each case, also give the inverse of the elementary matrix. (A) Question 5. Consider the elementary matrices E1 =    0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0    and E2 =    λ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1    . Calculate, for A = [aij] ∈ M33(R): (a) E2 · E1 · A. (b) E1 · E2 · A. (c) Do the calculations in (a) and (b) imply that matrix multiplication is not asso- ciative? (B) Question 6. Show that if a diagonal matrix D has an inverse, then D−1 is also diagonal. Find conditions on the entries of a diagonal matrix D to guarantee that D is invertible. (B) Question 7. Let A be an invertible square matrix. Prove that AT is invertible. What is its inverse? Hint: (X · Y) T = Y T · XT , and note that A T was introduced as: “(i, j)th entry of AT = (j, i)th entry of A\".1 2 1VGLA: INVERSE OF A SQUARE MATRIX PRACTICE QUESTIONS (B) Question 8.

(b) Express A−1 as a product of elementary matrices. (c) Express A as a product of elementary matrices. (B) Question 9. (a) Use the method described in lectures to calculate the inverse A−1 of the matrix A =    1 3 4 0 0 1 2 8 8    keeping track of the row operations that you use. (b) Express A−1 as a product of elementary matrices. (c) Express A as a product of elementary matrices. (C) Question 10. Prove the following statement using mathematical induction. Suppose that A1, A2, . . . , Am are all invertible n × n matrices. Then, (A1 · A2 · . . . · Am) −1 = A−1 m · A−1 m−1 · . . . · A−1 1 . This is Corollary 5.2 from the notes. (C) Question 11. An important property of numbers is the following: if x, y ∈ R \\ {0} then xy ∈ R \\ {0}. (a) Show that this fails for matrix multiplication by calculating A · B where A = [0 3 0 0 ] and B = [0 1 0 0 ] . A non-zero matrix A is called a divisor of zero if there exists a non-zero matrix B such that A · B is the zero matrix (of the appropriate dimension). (b) Show that [ 1 2 − 1 2 −1 ] is a divisor of zero. (C) Question 12. Let A, B and C be matrices with dimension m × n, n × p and p × q, respectively. Prove that matrix multiplication is associative, i.e. that (A · B) · C = A · (B · C). (C) Question 13. Deﬁne the (i, j) elements of the n × n elementary matrix E and its inverse E−1 (in each of the 3 cases), and calculate the (i, j) element of E · E−1 directly using the deﬁnition of matric multiplication.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
