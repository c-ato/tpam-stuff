Note that I have used the value of Planck’s constant in units of eV s, therefore the energy of the X-ray is given in eV. [1 mark] To find the distance between the crystal planes, use the Bragg equation and, for the first interference maximum, set 𝑛 = 1: 2𝑑 sin 𝜃 = 𝑛𝜆 [1 mark] 𝑑 = 𝑛𝜆 2 sin 𝜃 = 1 × 350 2 × sin\t(18C) = 566\tpm. [2 marks] b) To calculate the other angles, use sin 𝜃 = 𝑛𝜆 2𝑑 = 𝑛 × 350\tpm 2 × 566\tpm = 𝑛 × 0.309 [1 mark] Hence: 𝑛 = 2 gives sin 𝜃 = 0.618 and so 𝜃 = 0.667\tradians\tor 38.2C 𝑛 = 3 gives sin 𝜃 = 0.928 and so 𝜃 = 1.19\tradians or 68.1C Values of 𝑛 > 3 give values of sin 𝜃 greater than unity. Hence there may only be two further interference maxima. Condition is that sin 𝜃 \t ≤ 1. [3 marks] c) Using the same formula, we now require that sin 𝜃 ≤ 1 for 𝑛 = 2. This then gives the condition sin 𝜃 = 𝑛𝜆 2𝑑 ≤ 1 2𝜆 2𝑑 = 𝜆 𝑑 ≤ 1 𝜆 ≤ 566\tpm [2 marks]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
