{"path":"Chaos /Lecture/appendix1.pdf","text":"Appendix: Equations of motion The sprung pendulum Here we derive the equations of motion for the sprung pendulum using Newton’s laws. The most useful picture is mg r x z k(r−l) where we can read oﬀ the equations of motion in the Cartesian directions using Newton’s laws and trigonometry m d2x d2zin agreement with Newton’s laws. The energy is E = m and one should note that cos θ1 cos θ2 + sin θ1 sin θ2 = cos(θ1 − θ2) The potential energy is V = −mg1a1 cos θ1 − m2g [2a1 cos θ1 + a2 cos θ2] The rotational kinetic energy is T = 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
