Recall the following definition from the lectures: Definition. A sequence of real numbers (an) tends to infinity if given any real number A > 0 there exists N ∈ N such that an > A for all n > N.

A sequence (an) of real numbers converges to a real number ℓ if given any ε > 0 there exists N ∈ N such that |an − ℓ| < ε for all n > N.

(v) the sequence (anbn) neither converges nor tends to ±∞. (vi) bn > 0 for all n ∈ N, and the sequence (anbn) neither converges nor tends to ±∞.
