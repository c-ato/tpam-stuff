Two identical spheres of mass m, each carrying a charge q are suspended from the ceiling with a ﬂexible wire of length l. The electrostatic repulsion keeps the two spheres apart as shown in the ﬁgure. (a) At equilibrium, which of the following statements is true? (a) θ1 = θ2; (b) θ1 > θ2; (c) θ1 < θ2. Justify your answer. [1] (b) Derive an expression that relates the angles θ1, θ2 q, l and m. [1] 2. We now replace the sphere on the right hand side with a sphere twice as heavy. (a) Draw a diagram that includes all the forces. [1] (b) At equilibrium, which of the following statements is true? (a) θ1 = θ2; (b) θ1 > θ2; (c) θ1 < θ2. Justify your answer. [1] Problem 2. Consider a ”linear quadrupole” (see ﬁgure below) consisting of two adjacent dipoles oriented oppositely and placed end to end. This linear quadrupole is along the y axis. There is eﬀectively a point charge −2q at the centre, which is located at the origin of the (x, y) plane. The two positive charges +q are at a distance a from the centre. By adding up the electric ﬁelds of the charges, ﬁnd the x and y components of the electric ﬁeld at: 1. Point A along the y axis, [3] 2. Point B along the x axis, [3] if both A and B are at a distance r ≫ a from the origin. Express the results as a function of a n/rm (where n and m are integer numbers), keeping the leading order contribution in a in the expansion of the electric ﬁeld.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
