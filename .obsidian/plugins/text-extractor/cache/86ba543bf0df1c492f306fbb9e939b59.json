If more than 1 of them is defective, the box is returned. The screws are defective with probability 0.01. What is the probability a box is returned? If 10 boxes are sold every day for year, how many returns are expected? Introduction to Probability We could use the binomial: 𝑃 no defects = 𝑃 0 10,0.01 𝑃 0 10,0.01 = 10! 0! 10! 0.01 0 1 − 0.01 10 ≈ 0.9 Or Poisson 𝜆 = 𝑁𝑝 = 10 × 0.01 = 0.1 → 𝑃 0 = 0.1 0 0! 𝑒−0.1 ≈ 0.9 Then 𝑃 return = 1 − 𝑃 0 ≈ 0.1 returns = 𝑁𝑝 = 10 × 365 × 0.1 ≈ 365 Example I am cautious when I cook, but I also cook a lot. The probability I cut my finger is small, say 𝑝 = 1 10000 What is the probability that I cut my hand at least once if I cook three times a day for a year? Introduction to Probability 𝑝 = 1 10000 𝑁 = 3 × 365 = 1095 → 𝜆 = 𝑁𝑝 = 0.1095 Then Prob 𝑘 ≥ 1|𝜆 = 1 − 𝑃(𝑘 = 0|𝜆) = 1 − 0.1095 0 0! 𝑒−0.1095 ≈ 0.1 Class Example A box contains 100 balls, 2 of which are red. What is the probability of getting 3 red balls if you sample with replacement 50 times? Use the Poisson approximation. 1 𝑒 ≈ 0.37; 0.37 6 ≈ 0.06 Introduction to Probability 𝑝 = 2 100 , 𝑁 = 50 → 𝜆 = 50 × 2 100 = 1 𝑃 𝑘 = 3 = 13 3! 𝑒−1 ≈ 0.37 6 ≈ 0.06 Example The probability of hitting a target is 1 5. What is the probability of hitting the target twice in 10 independent throws? Given that it has been hit at least once, what is the probability of it being hit twice? Introduction to Probability The event of hitting is Bernoulli and we are interested in the total number – Binomial!
