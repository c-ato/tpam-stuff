Do try the questions though and look at the model solutions when they are released. You will be able to try Questions 1–3 immediately. You will be able to attempt Question 4 after the last lecture in Week 7 (i.e., by the end of 12th November). Remember that you should always carefully write out your solutions giving full explanations (not just stating the answer). Q1. Suppose that a = (2, 1, 0) is a vector. Determine the scalar equation of the plane Π perpendicular to a containing the point P = (1, 1, 1). Q2. The aim of this question is to ﬁnd the parametric form of the equation of the line of intersection of the planes Π1 = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 : x + 2y + z = 3} and Π2 = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 : x + y + 2z = 4}. To answer this question, we break the task into several sub-questions. (i) Give a normal vector n1 to the plane Π1 and a normal vector n2 to the plane Π2. (ii) Determine the vector product n1 × n2. (iii) Let L denote the line of intersection of Π1 and Π2. Explain why the vector n1 × n2 is parallel to L. [Hint: to convince yourself this is true, you could draw a picture of two planes intersecting in a line.] (iv) Use this fact to determine the parametric form of the equation of L. Q3. Suppose that z1 = 4 − 4i and z2 = 5 + 2i. (i) Calculate (a) z1z2, (b) z1z−1 2 and (c) z−1 1 + z−1 1 z2 giving your answer in the form a + bi for appropriate real numbers a and b. (ii) Determine the complex number α such that z1α = z2. Q4. Use De Moivre’s theorem to prove that sin 4θ = 4 cos θ sin θ(cos2 θ − sin 2 θ) for all θ ∈ R. 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
