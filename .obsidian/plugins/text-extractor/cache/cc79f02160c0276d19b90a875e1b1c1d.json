Michelson-Morley experiment In the previous lecture we have derived the law of velocity transformation which states that in the moving frame the velocity v′ is related to the velocity v in the stationary frame as Figure 1: Trajectory and Galilean transformation into a moving frame. v′ = v − V , where V is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the stationary frame. The transformation of velocities can be applied to waves as well. The familiar example is the Doppler eﬀect: the sound from a moving source moves with a diﬀerent velocity and it aﬀects its frequency. There is an important diﬀerence though: the sound waves propagate in a medium (air, water) thus there is a preferential frame, the one in which the medium is in rest. In this respect diﬀerent frequency shifts are obtained depending whether the emitter or the observer move with respect to the medium. What about another well-known wave phenomena, the light, which is an example of electromagnetic radiation? It was long believed that light waves, similarly to sound waves, are vibrations of a certain medium called “luminiferous aether”. In this case one would be able to tell the diﬀerence in speed of light propagation if either the light source or a detector is moving. Of course, the eﬀect will be tiny, as the speed of light c ≃ 300000km/s = 3 × 108m/s is huge compared to typical velocities we experience in everyday life. It is still ten thousand times bigger than the orbital speed of the earth, ve = 30km/s. Nevertheless, an American physicist Albert A. Michelson (1852-1931) devised an instrument, called Michelson interferometer which, in principle, would be able to detect tiny diﬀerences in the speed of light propagation. A schematic depiction of Michelson interferometer is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2: Michelson interfer- ometer Light from a source S (a distant star, for example) falls on an inclined semitransparent plate (beam splitter) P and splits into two parts. One part travels on through the plate and strikes the mirror M1. It retraces its path to the point where the beam was ﬁrst split. A second light path is reﬂected from the beam splitter to a mirror M2, goes back and then is recombined with the ﬁrst beam arriving at P . Both beams travel together from P to a detecting device D. This is an idealised picture: we neglect the thickness of the beam splitter P , losses and imperfections of the mirrors. We also assume that the lengths of both arms P M1 and P M2 of the interferometer are the same and equal to l. Nevertheless we will be able to get an idea of the measurement. It is based on the fact that if the interferometer moves with respect to the presumed aether the time intervals to travel along each path will be diﬀerent. Let us assume that the device moves in the direction P M1 velocity v with respect to hypothesised aether. Then the light of the ﬁrst beam P M1 would have a resultant velocity c − v (relative to the interferometer) when travelling towards the mirror M1 a resultant velocity c + v on the return DM Gangardt 1 University of Birmingham SR Lecture 02 Propagation of light. Michelson-Morley experiment trip. Thus it takes it t1 = l c − v + l c + v = 2lc c2 − v2 = 2l c 1 1 − v2/c2 to travel to M1 and back. The time t2 for the light to travel along the second path. To calculate it let us place ourselves in the frame of aether and imagine the trajectory from the beam splitter to the mirror and back in this frame. It is shown in Fig. 3. It consists of two segments, each taking time t2/2. In this time the mirror M2 travels a distance vt2/2 in horizontal direction, so from the Pythagoras theorem we have ( ct2 2 )2 − ( vt2 2 )2 = l2 ⇒ t2 = 2l c 1 √ 1 − v2/c2 , which is clearly diﬀerent from t1. Figure 3: Trajectory of the second beam in the æther frame. As it was noted before, the ratio v/c is extremely small. Taking v to be the earth’s orbital velocity v/c ≃ 30/300000 = 10−4. This allows us to use the approximations (Taylor expan- sion to ﬁrst order): 1 1 − v2/c2 ≃ 1 + v2 c2 1 √ 1 − v2/c2 ≃ 1 + 1 2 v2 c2 , so that the time delay between the two light beams is ∆t = t1 − t2 = 2l c ( 1 1 − v2/c2 − 1 √ 1 − v2/c2 ) ≃ l c v2 c2 . This time delay is extremely small: not only it takes l/c ≃ 1m/3 · 108m s−1 ≃ 3.3 · 10−8s for the light beam to travel a typical size (1m) of the interferom- eter, it is also gets multiplied by the square of the ratio v/c. There was no chance to measure such minuscule time intervals. However the principle of interferometric measurements is based on detecting the diﬀerence in optical path ∆lopt = c∆t by comparing it to the wavelength λ of the light. What one measures is the relative shift of the interference pattern, δ = ∆lopt λ = c∆t λ = l λ v2 c2 . For a typical wavelength λ ≃ 500nm = 5 · 10−7m the smallness of v2/c2 is compensated and δ ≃ 0.02 can be detected. The Michelson-Morley experiment was conducted in 1887. The interferometer was rotated so that the mirrors M1 and M2 change their position with respect to the direction of motion which, be the luminiferous aether a reality, would result in a detectable shift of the interference pattern. However it was concluded beyond any doubt that δ = 0. This, in turn, ruled out the Galilean law of velocity transformation for light waves. In the next lecture we will follow Einstein and modify Galilean transformation to accom- modate for invariance of light speed observed in MM experiment. Thus we will formulate postulates of Special Relativity and ﬁnd the new space-time (Lorentz) transformation. DM Gangardt 2 University of Birmingham","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
