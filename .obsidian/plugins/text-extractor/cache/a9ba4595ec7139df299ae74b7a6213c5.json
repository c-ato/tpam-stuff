The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Problem 1.1 Aluminium atomic spacing Aluminium has an Atomic Weight of 27 and a density of 2700 kg m−3. Estimate the typical spacing of the Aluminium atoms. Volume of 1 mol of Al = Mass of one mol Density = 27 × 10 −3kg 2700 kg m−3 = 10 −5m 3 The volume is occupied by Na = 6 × 10 23 atoms, so Volume occupied by one atom = 10 −5 6 × 1023 = 1.7 × 10 −29m 3 . Now treat the volume as a cube, and interpret the length of one side as being the inter- atomic spacing. So Typical inter-atomic spacing = 3√ 1.7 × 10−29m = 2.5 × 10 −10m . Problem 1.2 Lennard-Jones forces See the ﬁgure below with superimposed graphs of the Lennard-Jones potential and the corresponding force. Figure 1.1: The Lennard Jones potential and the force derived from it. Notice the maximum force (in magnitude) is at the point of inﬂection of the potential, and the zero of the force is at the equilibrium point. 1 ATOMS, MATTER - SOLUTIONS 2 Problem 1.3 Derivation of size of atom by dimensional analysis We may calculate d by dimensional analysis as well, but it gives little physical insight. Let [X] denote the dimensions of the quantity X, then (avoiding confusion between latent heat, L, and L, the dimension of length) [ℓ] = [γ]α[L]β[ρ] δ = (M L2T −2L −2) α(M L2T −2M −1)β(M L−3)δ ⇒ L = M α+δT −2(α+β)L2β−3δ . We now compare powers of M , T and L to get three linear equations: equation for M 0 = α + δ (1.1) equation for T 0 = −2(α + β) (1.2) equation for L 1 = 2β − 3δ (1.3) Then we may deduce from Eqns. (1.1) and (1.2) that 2δ − 2β = 0 . So substituting δ = β into Eqn. (1.3) we see that δ = −1, and then β = −1 and ﬁnally α = 1. So ℓ = γ Lρ = d 4 . I.e. reproducing the physical calculation, but with no physical insight. Problem 1.4 Three Lennard-Jones atoms and fracture The total potential energy, V tot(x1, x2, x3), is: V tot(x1, x2, x3) = Vlj(x2 − x1) + Vlj(x3 − x2) . Even spacing of the atoms yields x1 = −a, x2 = 0 and x3 = a. To see if atom 2 is at a point of equilibrium, let us diﬀerentiate V tot(x1 = a, x2, x3 = a) with respect to x2, note that since atoms 1 and 2 are ﬁxed the derivative is an ordinary derivative: dV tot dx2 = dVlj(x2 + a) dx2 + dVlj(a − x2) dx2 ⇒ dV tot dx2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣x2=0 = V ′ lj(a) − V ′ lj(a) = 0 , where the minus sign in the second term comes from the chain rule. Thus x2 = 0 is indeed a point of equilibrium. But is it stable? Let us examine the second derivative: d2V tot dx2 2 = d 2Vlj(x2 + a) dx2 2 + d 2Vlj(a − x2) dx2 2 ⇒ d 2V tot dx2 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣x2=0 = V ′′ lj(a) + (−1) 2V ′′ lj(a) = 2V ′′ lj(a) = { 2|V ′′ lj(a)| if a < ri, −2|V ′′ lj(a)| if a > ri. 1 ATOMS, MATTER - SOLUTIONS 3 Thus if the distance between atoms 1 and 3 is less than twice the distance to the point of inﬂection in the LJ potential, ie 2a < 2ri, the equilibrium at x2 is stable. But if 2a > 2ri, then the equilibrium is unstable. Upon any slight perturbation atom 2 will accelerate towards either 1 or 3. The \"chain\" of three atoms breaks and this is a simple model of fracture. Exactly at a = ri, atom 2 is in neutral equilibrium. Note this analysis does not rule out new equilibrium points occurring away from x2 = 0 before that position becomes unstable. ♣Problem 1.5 Diﬀerence between sand and ﬂour The key diﬀerence between a grain of sand and a particle of ﬂour is their size. Typically a grain of sand might be 1 mm, whereas for ﬂour it is 0.05mm. (A table of size nomenclature for geological entities (from boulders to silt) is here.) Given the hint in the question, Hamaker’s solution to the van der Waals interaction between two spheres, note in the limit where their separation, d, is small compared to their size, R, then V int ≃ −U0(R/d). To form a \"clump\" one must consider the gravitational potential energy of placing one grain on top of another. This is ∆V grav ≃ M gR, where M is the mass of the grain. But M gR = 4π 3 ρR3gR . where ρ is the mass-density of the material. Thus the total energy, adding these two contributions is: E tot = V int + ∆V grav = −U0 R d + 4π 3 gdρd3 ︸ ︷︷ ︸ microscopic energy of lifting one atom ( R d )4 To compare the two terms let us take their ratio, say v: v = ∆V grav V int = −4π 3 gdρd3 U0 ( R d )3 . As the size of the grain, R, gets smaller this ratio gets smaller. The pre-factor is already very small, being the ratio of (for, say, atomic weight of 100 and d = 1˚A) 1.5 × 10 −34J to 5 × 10 −21J (assuming the spacing of the atoms is around 1 ˚A. The critical size for clumping should be when this ratio is around unity, i.e. v ≃ 1. This predicts: Rcrit d ≃ 3 √ 5 × 10−21 1.5 × 10−34 ≃ 3.2 × 10 4 ⇒ Rcrit ≃ 3.2µm = 0.0032 mm . This is a bit small and shows that the ﬂour grains do not approach on average to an atomic distance (presumably due to asperities on their surfaces). ♣Problem 1.6 Bodies held together by gravity - the Roche limit Firstly let us evaluate the gravitational force (per unit mass) due to the planet at the edges 1 ATOMS, MATTER - SOLUTIONS 4 of the asteroid, in the radial direction: F(r ± a) = − GM (r ± a)2ˆr ≃ −GM r2 (1 ∓ 2a r ) So if we now consider a model of the asteroid as being two point particles each of mass m, at r ± a, then there is a \"tidal\" force, δF, on each away from the centre of mass (away from the planet for the \"outer\" mass and towards the planet for the inner mass). This should be contrasted with the mutual attraction of the two masses, Fatt = ± Gm 2 (2a)2ˆr . Here the plus sign is for the inner mass and the minus sign is for the outer mass. Then the total force, F tot ± , (relative to the centre of mass), where the plus sign is the force on the inner mass, is: F tot ± = ( ∓2GM ma (r)3 ± Gm 2 (2a)2 ) ˆr . We ﬁnd the two forces balance when r = rr, the Roche radius 0 = GM m r2 r ( −2 a rr + m M ( rr 2a )2) ⇒ r3 r = (2a) 3 M m ⇒ rr = 2a 3 √ M m is the Roche limit. It is interesting to note that most of Saturn’s rings are inside the Roche limit (using a as their width). That could be evidence of primordial satellites being torn apart by the tidal forces.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
