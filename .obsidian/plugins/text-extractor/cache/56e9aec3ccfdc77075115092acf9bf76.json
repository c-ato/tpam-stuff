You can compute the electrostatic energy by computing the work that is needed to build up the cylinder step by step, in this case by bringing in cylindrical shells of charge with the same density. 1. Consider ﬁrst the set up at an intermediate stage when you have already built a cylinder with a radius r < a, and charge density ρ. (a) What is the electric ﬁeld E of this cylinder at radius x > r? Express the result as a function of x and ρ. The electric ﬁeld at x , generated by the cylinder of radius r is: E (x) = ρπr2 2πϵ0 1 x = ρr2 2ϵ0 1 x [1 mark] (b) What is the work, ∆W , done in bringing charge ∆q from a radius R > r down to the radius r? ∆W = − ∫ r R ∆qE (x) dx = −∆q ∫ r R ρr2 2ϵ0 dx x = +∆q ρr2 2ϵ0 ln R r [2 marks] 2. As we build up the cylinder in steps, using cylindrical shells of inﬁnitesimal width δr and length ℓ, write down an expression for ∆q in terms of r, δr, ℓ and ρ. ∆q = ρl2πrδr [1 mark] 3. Compute now the total work per unit length done in building up the full cylinder of radius a by integrating the work ∆W . ∆W = ∆q ρr2 2ϵ0 ln R r = ρl2πrδr ρr2 2ϵ0 ln R r ∆W = π ϵ0 ρ 2lr3 ln R r δr [1 mark] Hence inﬁnitesimal work per unit length is δw = ∆W l = π ϵ0 ρ2r3 ln R r δr [1 mark] Total work done: w = ∫ a 0 dw = π ϵ0 ρ 2 (∫ a 0 r3 ln R r dr) = π ϵ0 ρ 2 ( a4 16 + a4 4 ln R a ) [1 mark] Method 2. You should obtain the same result if you compute the energy per unit length by applying the known result that the energy density of the electrostatic ﬁeld is dU dV = 1 2ϵ0 E2 . 6. Compute the energy per unit length uins inside the cylinder. E-ﬁeld inside the cylinder is Ein = ρr 2ϵ0 and dV = 2πrldr so energy inside cylinder is: Uin = 1 2ϵ0 ∫ a 0 ( ρ 2ϵ0 r)2 2πlrdr = πρ 2l 4ϵ0 ∫ a 0 r3dr Uin = πρ 2l 4ϵ0 a4 4 = πρ 2l ϵ0 a4 16 So energy per unit length inside is just: uin = πρ 2 ϵ0 a4 16 [2 marks] Which is the ﬁrst term from the result of the previous method. 7. Compute the energy per unit length uext external to the cylinder up to a radius R > r. The E-ﬁeld outside the cylinder is Eout = ρa2 2ϵ0r so energy outside the cylinder is: U out = 1 2 ϵ0 ∫ R a ( ρa2 2ϵ0r )2 2πlrdr = πρ 2l 4ϵ0 a4 ln R a So energy per unit length outside is just: uout = πρ 2 4ϵ0 a4 ln R a [1 mark]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
