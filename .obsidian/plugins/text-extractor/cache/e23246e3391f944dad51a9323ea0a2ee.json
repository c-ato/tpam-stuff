The E field near to a point charge rˆ r q E 2 04pe = •The density of the field lines is proportional to the strength of E The absolute number of lines is not important. You cannot obtain the field strength by counting the number of lines. Adding lines must follow rules. •Field lines only start on positive charge, they can only end on negative charge The tangent at any point gives the direction of E at that point. Example: E field lines around an electric dipole Field lines terminate at distant negative charges Field lines originate from distant positive charges Field lines do not cross one another! Field lines are continuous, only stop at charges! Continuous Charge Distributions • What do we do if the object is not a point particle? • Break the distribution into small (infinitesimal) pieces • Treat each piece as a point charge and add up the separate E-fields (as a vector of course!) • This can get messy - typically results in a 3D integral, evaluated numerically by computer 10 Charge Distributions Charge can be distributed along a line, over a surface, or through a volume. • Use  to represent charge/length over the element dl 𝑞 = ׬  𝑑𝑙 • Use  to represent the charge/unit area over a surface area element dA 𝑞 = ׬ 𝜎 𝑑𝐴 • Use  to represent the charge/unit volume in a volume element dV 𝑞 = ׬ 𝜌 𝑑𝑉 11 Example 2.1: E-field from line of charge • Consider the E-field at a point along a line perpendicular to the mid point of line of uniform charge. 12 dQ y No Ey Take an element of charge Q = y along line at y. Use symmetry and consider element of charge at –y Use Coulomb’s Law and integrate. Example 2.2 - Calculate the E-field on the axis of a thin ring of charge Q. • Represent the charge distribution as a series of small elements s each with a charge Q (+ charge) 13 1 2dE dQ q q Example 2.2 – use symmetry • Use symmetry. Consider two ring elements which are diagonal to each other. 14 Example 2.2 Do example on the visualizer 15","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
