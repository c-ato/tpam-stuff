This is clearly not realistic in many cases. This week we will relax this assumption, and reconsider some simple examples, in particular using Conservation of Momentum. 2 Conservation of Momentum and Newton’s Second Law We are used to Newton’s Second Law in the form “Force equals mass times acceleration”. This, however, only works when mass is constant. For examples with variable mass we need the more general law of “Conservation of Momentum”, where force is equal to the rate of change of (linear) momentum. Recalling that momentum p is deﬁned via p = mv where v is velocity (and v = ˙r for a particle with position vector r), we therefore have F = dp dt . Note that when mass is constant this reduces to F = dp dt , = d(mv) dt , = mdv dt , = ma, where a gives the acceleration, as before. This concept (along with a similar equation representing conservation of mass, saying that the amount of “stuﬀ” you have remains the same) forms the basis for most mechanical models used in a wide variety of applications, from understanding how planes ﬂy, to how cancer tumours grow, to how a chocolate fountain works, and will be used extensively in year 3 modules such as Continuum Mechanics and Advanced Mathematical Modelling. 3 No net force Even if there is no net force acting on the particle, allowing for variable mass can allow changes in motion. For example consider standing on ice (or some other approximation of a zero friction surface e.g. standing on a skateboard or ﬂoating in space) and throwing a heavy item away from you. Since momentum over the whole system will be conserved, you will start to move in the opposite direction, despite the fact that no external force has acted on you. Rocket ships use this principle to generate thrust by burning fuel and expelling exhaust gas at high velocity to push the rocket forwards. 2 3.1 Instantaneous mass ejection When all the mass that is going to ejected is thrown out instantaneously, conservation of momentum can be easily applied to work out the ﬁnal velocity. Example 1: Movement on ice If a person of mass mp is standing on smooth ice (so there is no friction) holding a heavy object of mass mo which they push away from them with velocity vo relative to their new motion, what is the resulting motion of the person? Solution. We assume all motion happens in 1D, with the object thrown in the positive x direction. Since there are no net forces acting on the person, and the person (and hence also the object) is initially at rest, conservation of momentum across the whole system gives mpvp + mo (vo + vp) = 0, where vp is the velocity of the person, by summing the momentum of both the object and the person. Hence rearranging gives the velocity of the person as vp = − mo mp + mo vo, where the minus sign shows they are moving in the opposite direction to that which they threw the object. ◀ 3.2 Continuous mass ejection In contrast, when the mass is being ejected continuously (for example a rocket burning fuel), more care is needed as the ejected materal will have a diﬀerent velocity depending on the time at which it was expelled. In such cases we consider what’s happening over a small time δt, and then take the limit as δt tends to zero to ﬁnd the governing equation. We will consider examples where the motion occurs only in one dimension, but things generalise to more than one dimension in the obvious way. It is also important to be very clear about what frame of reference velocities are being measured in. Derivation We ﬁrst derive the Rocket Equation for a rocket generating forward thrust by expelling exhaust gases. This equation has wider applicability, but it’s easiest to be more speciﬁc in the derivation. At time t let the rocket ship have mass m(t) and be moving with velocity v(t) relative to a ﬁxed inertial frame (i.e. as a ﬁxed observed would see it). The total momentum of the rocket at time t is then given by P (t) = mv. We consider what happens over a short time interval δt, during which the rocket expels a small amount of exhaust gas backwards at a velocity vex relative to the rocket, or at 3 a velocity v + δv − vex in the ﬁxed inertial reference frame, where δv gives the change in the velocity of the rocket. This leads to a change in the mass of the rocket which we denote δm (which we know will be negative), so the mass at time t + δt will be m + δm (see footnote for an alternative method 1). This will also lead to a change in the velocity of the rocket v + δv, and hence the momentum of the rocket at time t + δt is Procket(t + δt) = (m + δm)(v + δv). The expelled fuel also has momentum which is contributing to the overall momentum of the system. The expelled fuel has mass −δm and velocity v + δv − vex so that the fuel momentum at time t + δt is given by Pf uel(t + δt) = −δm(v − vex). Thus the total momentum at time t + δt is P (t + δt) = Procket(t + δt) + Pf uel(t + δt), = (m + δm)(v + δv) − δm(v + δv − vex). Since no forces are acting on the rocket, there is no change in momentum over the time δt, and hence 0 = P (t + δt) − P (t), = (m + δm)(v + δv) − δm(v + δv − vex) − mv. Now, since δt is small, we also expect δm and δv to be small. Therefore δmδv is very small, and these terms can be neglected (in fact they cancel in this case anyway). Hence 0 = mδv + vexδm since the leading order “mv” terms cancel. Dividing through by δt and taking the limit as δt → 0 we have 0 = mdv dt + vex dm dt . The quantity −vex dm dt is often referred to as the thrust of the rocket. Example 2: Rocket with no external force A rocket of mass Mr neglecting fuel blasts oﬀ from rest and expels fuel at a constant rate k and velocity vex relative to the ship. Ignoring the eﬀect of gravity, if the total mass of fuel initially is Mf , what will be the ﬁnal velocity of the rocket? Solution. The Rocket equation 0 = mdv dt + vex dm dt , will hold as derived above. If the fuel is burnt at a constant rate k, the total mass of fuel mf will evolve according to dmf dt = −k, 1This could also be written as m (t + δt) etc. The derivation can then be replicated by Taylor expand- ing all functions for small δt. 4 which we integrate to give mf = Mf − kt, where Mf gives the initial mass of fuel. The total mass of the rocket is therefore m (t) = Mr + mf (t) , = Mr + Mf − kt, by summing the mass of the rocket and the mass of the fuel. This will hold until all the fuel has been burnt such that mf = 0 at t = Mf /k. Thus the rocket equation gives 0 = mdv dt + vex dm dt , (Mr + Mf − kt) dv dt = kvex, since dm/dt = −k. We rearrange and integrate with respect to t to solve: ∫ dv dt dt = ∫ kvex Mr + Mf − ktdt, =⇒ ∫ dv = −vex ln (Mr + Mf − kt) + constant, =⇒ v = −vex ln (Mr + Mf − kt) + vex ln (Mr + Mf ) , = vex ln ( Mr + Mf Mr + Mf − kt ) , using the initial condition that v = 0 at t = 0. Now, we run out of fuel when t = Mf /k at which point the velocity is v = vex ln ( Mr + Mf Mr ) , giving us the ﬁnal velocity of the rocket. We see this is controlled by varying either the expulsion speed vex, or the rocket-to-fuel mass ratio Mf /Mr. The ﬁnal velocity will be much more sensitive to the expulsion speed than the mass ratio due to the logarithm, so this should be targeted if you want to increase the rocket’s ﬁnal speed. ◀ 4 Including a net force If the rocket (for example) is also subject to a net force, most of the derivation above continues to hold. However the change in momentum of the system P (t + δt) − P (t) no longer equals zero, but rather changes in momentum will be related to the net force applied F (t) and the length of time over which it is applied δt. Hence instead we have F δt = P (t + δt) − P (t), = mδv + vexδm, 5 again neglecting higher order terms of the form δmδv. Dividing by δt we ﬁnd F = P (t + δt) − P (t) δt , = mδv δt + vex δm δt , and letting δt tend to zero gives F = dP dt , = mdv dt + vex dm dt . This is very similar to before, but where the force F can eﬀect changes in the overall momentum of the system. Example 3: Rocket acted upon by gravity In the early stages of a rocket ﬂight gravity cannot be neglected. If we take a coordinate system in which gravity points downwards, where a rocket of mass Mr neglecting fuel blasts oﬀ from rest and expels fuel at a constant rate k and velocity vex relative to the ship, the governing equation becomes −mg = mdv dt + vex dm dt . As before m(t) = Mr + Mf − kt, and hence −(Mr + Mf − kt)g = (Mr + Mf − kt)dv dt − kvex. Rearranging this we get dv dt = −g + kvex Mr + Mf − kt. Integrating this equation and using v = 0 at t = 0 we ﬁnd v = −gt + vex ln ( Mr + Mf Mr + Mf − kt ) . The ﬁnal velocity is again when kt = Mf and all the fuel has been burnt. This gives v = vex ln ( Mr + Mf Mr ) − gMf k . This shows that the ﬁnal velocity in the presence of gravity is always less than the velocity in the absence of gravity. Also, for ﬁxed values of Mr, Mf and vex, the inﬂuence of gravity can be reduced by increasing the value of k (i.e. burning the rocket fuel at a faster rate). Example 4: Raindrop accumulating mass as it falls through a cloud 6 Suppose that a raindrop falls through an (assumed stationary) cloud, and accumulates mass at a rate kmv for some constant k, where m is the mass of the raindrop and v is its velocity. If the raindrop starts from rest with initial mass m0, ﬁnd its mass and velocity at time t. Solution. Since the mass being added to the raindrop has zero initial velocity it also has zero initial momentum (note that this is not the case if the added mass is moving with an initial velocity when more care is needed!). Taking gravity to act in the positive direction conservation of momentum gives mg = d dt (mv) , = mdv dt + v dm dt . Now we know that the mass evolves according to dm dt = kmv, giving mg = mdv dt + kmv2. To solve this we cancel through by m and rearrange to ﬁnd dv dt = g − kv2. This is a separable equation and hence 1 g − kv2 dv dt = 1, =⇒ ∫ 1 g − kv2 dv dt dt = ∫ dt. We solve this using partial fractions, ﬁrst noticing this will be easier is we deﬁne γ2 = g/k(> 0). Then 1 g − kv2 = 1 k 1 g/k − v2 , = 1 k 1 γ2 − v2 , = 1 k 1 (γ − v) (γ + v), = 1 2kγ ( 1 (γ − v) + 1 (γ + v) ) . Hence ∫ 1 g − kv2 dv dt dt = ∫ dt, =⇒ ∫ 1 2kγ ( 1 (γ − v) + 1 (γ + v) ) dv = ∫ dt, =⇒ 1 2kγ (− ln (γ − v) + ln (γ + v)) = t + constant. 7 Using v = 0 at t = 0 we ﬁnd t = 1 2kγ ln ( γ + v γ − v ) . This is rearranged to give γ + v γ − v = e2kγt, =⇒ γ + v = (γ − v) e2kγt, =⇒ v (1 + e 2kγt) = γ (e 2kγt − 1 ) , =⇒ v = γ e 2kγt − 1 1 + e2kγt , = γ tanh (γkt) , = √ g k tanh (√ kgt) . This gives the velocity of the raindrop. We can now ﬁnd the mass, since dm dt = kmv, = km √ g k tanh (√ kgt) , = m√ kg tanh (√kgt) . This is again separable, so we ﬁnd ∫ 1 m dm dt dt = √ kg ∫ tanh (√kgt) dt, =⇒ ln m = ln cosh (√kgt) + constant, =⇒ ln m = ln cosh (√kgt) + ln m0, where m = m0 at t = 0 is the initial mass. Hence m = m0 cosh (√ kgt) , gives the evolving mass of the raindrop. ◀ This concludes the section on variable mass, and hence the content of the module!
