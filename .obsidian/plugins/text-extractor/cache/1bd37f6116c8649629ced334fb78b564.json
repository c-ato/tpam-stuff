(1) Each drop has capacitance: C = 4πϵ0a As the spheres (rain drops) are far enough apart as to not aﬀect each other, the total capacitance is just N times the capacitance of each i.e. Ctotal = N C = 4πϵ0N a [1 mark] (2) If the total charge is Q, the charge on each raindrop is Q/N . Therefore the potential on each raindrop is: V = Q/N 4πϵ0a = Q 4πϵ0N a [1 mark] (3) If the rain drops combine to form one big drop of radius R, say, the volume remains the same and hence: volume = 4π 3 R3 = N 4π 3 a3 =⇒ R = aN 1/3 The capacitance of the single drop is hence: C = 4πϵ0aN 1/3 [1 mark] Note this is a factor N 2/3 smaller than the capacitance of the system of N rain drops. Problem 2. (1) Assume capacitance of body is roughly that of a conducting sphere with radius r = 0.5m (Note: any value of r between 0.3m and 1.5m is ok) So C = 4πϵ0r = 4π × 8.85 × 10 −12 × 0.5 ≈ 5.6 × 10 −11F [1 mark] (Note value may vary between 3.3 × 10 −11F and 1.7 × 10 −10F ) (2) Energy stored in a capacitor is: U = 1 2 CV 2 = 0.5 × 5.6 × 10 −11 × (2 × 10 3)2 ≈ 1.1 × 10 −4J [1 mark] (Note value may vary between 6.5 × 10 −5F and 3.3 × 10 −4F ) Problem 3. (1) The energy stored in a capacitor is 1 2CV 2 and the capacitance of a sphere is C = 4πϵ0r Hence the initial and ﬁnal energies are: initial Ui = 0.5 (4πϵ0R) φ 2 = 2πϵ0Rφ2 [1 mark] ﬁnal Uf = 0.5 (4πϵ0 × 0) φ 2 = 0 [1 mark] (2) Relationship between charge and capacitance is Q = CV Hence ﬁnal charge on shell (r = 0) is: Q = CV = 0 As C = 0 [1 mark] (3) The initial charge was Q, say, and the ﬁnal charge was zero. Hence this charge has been transferred back to the battery through a potential diﬀerence of −φ. So the work done by the battery is: Wby = Q (−φ) = −Qφ = − (Ciniitalφ) φ = −4πϵ0Rφ2 The work done by the battery is negative which means work is actually done on the battery. I.e. the work done on the battery is: Won = 4πϵ0Rφ2 [1 mark] (Note, 0.5 marks deducted if sign is wrong). (4) By conservation of energy, the work done by you is: Ui + Wyou + Wby−battery = Uf Wyou = Uf − Ui − Wby−battery = 0 − 2πϵ0Rφ2 − (−4πϵ0Rφ2) = 2πϵ0Rφ2 [1 mark] This work is positive i.e. work is done by you and you help to charge the battery.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
