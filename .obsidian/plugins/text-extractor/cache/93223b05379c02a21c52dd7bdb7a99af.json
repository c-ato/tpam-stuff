The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Problem 4.1 Simple conduction Use as the thermal conductivity for copper κCu = 390 Wm −1K−1. 1. the temperature gradient is: T2 − T1 L = 125 0.25 Km−1 = 500 Km−1 . 2. the rate of heat transfer ˙Q = κA T2 − T1 L = 3.9 × 10 2 × 10 −4 × 500 Js −1 = 19.5 Js −1 3. The temperature, T3, of the rod 10 cm from the high temperature end: T3 = ( 125 − 10 25125 ) K = 75 K . Problem 4.2 Melting ice 1. The rate of heat transfer, ˙Q, is ˙Q = 390 × (4.8 × 10 −4) 100 1.2 Js −1 ≃ 15.6 Js −1 . 2. Find the rate at which ice melts at the cold end. Need to look up latent heat of melting of ice: L = 3.34 × 10 5 J kg−1. Then the rate of ice melting is ˙Q L = 15.6 3.34 × 105 kg s−1 = 4.8 × 10 −5 kg s−1 . Problem 4.3 Dry and damp skiers We must realise at the start that to a good approximation the shape of the skier is irrelevant, as the clothes are 1 cm thick, but the dimensions of the limbs are around 10 cm, so we can treat the body as a plane of area A = 1.8 m 2. 1. Absorbing a minus sign into the deﬁnition of ∆T > 0, ˙Qdry = κclothingA ∆T L = 4 × 10 −2 × 1.8 × 38 10−2 Js −1 = 274 Js −1 . 4 HEAT TRANSFER – SOLUTIONS 2 2. If the skier falls over so their clothes are now wet, we need the thermal conductivity of water, κwater = 0.6 Wm −1K−1 as the spaces which were full of air are now full of water. So the thermal ﬂux is ˙Qwet = 0.6 0.04 ˙Qdry = 15 ˙Qdry = 4100 Js −1 . This is why falling over is not a good idea. Problem 4.4 Cylinders and spheres For the cylindrical shell we see that (noting that temperature only depends on r) using A = 2πrL, ˙Q = −κ(2πrL)dT dr ⇒ ˙Q dr κ(2πrL) = −dT ⇒ ˙Q κ(2πL)(ln r − ln r1) = −T (r) + T (r1) (integrating from r1 to r) ⇒ T (r1) − ˙Q κ(2πL) ln ( r r1 ) = T (r) For the spherical shell, A = 4πr2, so: ˙Q = −κ4πr2 dT dr ⇒ ˙Q dr κ4πr2 = −dT ⇒ ˙Q κ4π ( 1 r1 − 1 r ) = −T (r) + T (r1) ⇒ T (r1) − ˙Q κ4π ( 1 r1 − 1 r ) = T (r) Problem 4.5 The heat equation 1. The ﬂux of heat through the two faces is (assuming that the area and thermal con- ductivity do no vary with x), noting the ﬂow is inwards for x and outwards for x + dx, ˙Qnet = − ˙Q(x + dx) + ˙Q(x) = κA (∂T ∂x (x + dx) − ∂T ∂x (x) ) ≃ κA ( ∂T ∂x (x) + dx ∂2T ∂x2 + · · · − ∂T ∂x (x)) = κAdx ∂2T ∂x2 . (4.1) 2. see ﬁrst item. 4 HEAT TRANSFER – SOLUTIONS 3 3. The temperature, T (t), of the section changes with time, because there is a net heat ﬂux into it. If the speciﬁc heat per unit mass is cv and so the speciﬁc heat per unit volume is cvρ where ρ is the density. Then the speciﬁc heat of the section, which has volume dxA, is C = cvρdxA . Then we may use (from ∆Q = C∆T ) ˙Qnet = C ∂T ∂t (x, t) = cvρdxA ∂T ∂t (x, t) . Equating this with the r.h.s of Eq. (4.1) we ﬁnd: cvρdxA ∂T ∂t (x, t) = κAdx∂2T ∂x2 ⇒ ∂T ∂t = κ cvρ ∂2T ∂x2 ⇒ ∂T ∂t = α ∂2T ∂x2 , where the thermal diﬀusivity, α, is α = κ cvρ . This is the heat equation. We now examine some simple consequences of this. 4. If the temperature is linear in position i.e. T (x) = ˜T (t)x, then ∂2T /∂x2 = 0 and so ∂T /∂t = 0. 5. Thus taking ˜T (t) = τ , a constant, ˙Q must be constant with x. This guarantees the net heat ﬂux into each section is zero and so the temperature does not change with time. Problem 4.6 Series and parallel thermal conductors 1. For there to be no build up at the boundaries the heat ﬂuxes on both sides of the boundary must be equal. Thus ˙Qleft = ˙Qright ⇒ −κ1A1 ∂Tleft ∂x = −κ2A2 ∂Tright ∂x . Note if we wish no variation in temperature on each side of the junction, we need ∂2T /∂x2 = 0, so the temperature must be linear with x. Thus if the temperature at the interface is T0, the temperature gradient on the left of the junction is T1 − T0 L1 and on the right T0 − T2 L2 . 4 HEAT TRANSFER – SOLUTIONS 4 2. To deduce the temperature at the interface between the two materials, we require the heat ﬂows on both sides of the junction to be equal: κ1A1 T1 − T0 L1 = κ2A2 T0 − T2 L2 ⇒ κ1A1T1 L1 + κ2A2T2 L2 = ( κ1A1 L1 + κ2A2 L2 ) T0 ⇒ κ1A1T1 L1 + κ2A2T2 L2 κ1A1 L1 + κ2A2 L2 = T0 ⇒ K1T1 + K2T2 K1 + K2 = T0 , where the thermal conductances Ki are deﬁned Ki = κiAi Li . Returning to the heat ﬂux: ˙Q = κ1A1 T1 − T0 L1 = K1(T1 − T0) = K1 (T1 − K1T1 + K2T2 K1 + K2 ) = K1 ( T1(K1 + K2) − (K1T1 + K2T2) K1 + K2 ) = K1 ( T1K2 − K2T2 K1 + K2 ) = K1K2 K1 + K2 (T1 − T2) = K series tot (T1 − T2) . I.e. 1 K series tot = 1 K1 + 1 K2 , like electrical conductances, not resistances. If they are placed in parallel between the two heat baths (disregarding the inconvenient diﬀerence in lengths). 3. The heat ﬂow through each conductor, i = 1, 2 is ˙Qi = κiAi T1 − T2 Li = Ki(T1 − T2) . Thus the total heat ﬂow through the two conductors is ˙Qtot = ˙Q1 + ˙Q2 = (K1 + K2)(T1 − T2) = K parallel tot (T1 − T2) . 4 HEAT TRANSFER – SOLUTIONS 5 So thermal conductances add when in parallel. (As do electrical conductances as against resistances.) Problem 4.7 Heat equation with internal heat generation This is really very straightforward. Recall the expression for the net heat ﬂux into a section, but now modiﬁed by a term representing the creation of heat in the volume dxA, ˙qAdx: ˙Qnet = − ˙Q(x + dx) + ˙Q(x) + ˙qAdx = κAdx ∂2T ∂x2 + ˙qAdx ⇒ ρcvAdx ∂T ∂t = κAdx ∂2T ∂x2 + ˙qAdx ⇒ ∂T ∂t = κ ρcv ∂2T ∂x2 + ˙q ρcv ⇒ ∂T ∂t = α ∂2T ∂x2 + ˙q ρcv . Problem 4.8 The Great Ocean Conveyor The water in the current at the ocean bottom moves a distance of the order of 10 4 km, at a speed of 1 cm s −1, taking a time 10 9 s ≃ 100 years. Noting that the bottom 2 km of the ocean is involved in this motion, we might consider a cuboid of 1 m2 by 2 km, with a heat ﬂux in at the sea bed of order 0.1 Wm−2, so the total energy acquired by the cuboid is Ecuboid = 10 8 J. The mass of the cuboid is mcuboid = 2000 × ρwater = 2 × 10 6 kg, and hence the heat capacity of the cuboid is cmcuboid = Ccuboid = 2 × 10 6 × 4 × 10 3 J K−1 = 8 × 10 9 J K−1. Thus the temperature rise is Ecuboid/Ccuboid ≃ (10 8/10 10) K = 10−2K. This is very small compared to the change in temperature of the water due to interaction with solar radiation in the tropics and loss of heat to the atmosphere as the Arctic is approached which is of the order of 20 K. So despite the long timescale of the interaction with the sea bed the time is too short to allow the water to warm up. Problem 4.9 Radiative transport in series with conduction Let the temperature at the end of the cylindrical conductor (Fig. (4.1)) be T2. Then in steady state the temperature gradient in the conductor must be constant, so the heat ﬂux within the conductor is uniform. Then the ﬂux in the conductor must be equal to that being lost radiatively. So σAT 4 2 = κA T1 − T2 L . (4.2) There is only one unknown in this equation, T2, but the equation is quartic in T2, so the solution, in general, is complicated. There is a natural temperature scale revealed by dividing through by σ, implying that the dimensions of the resulting product on the right hand side, [κ/(σL)] = (temperature) 3 = 4 HEAT TRANSFER – SOLUTIONS 6 Figure 4.1: A copper rod connected to a heat bath at temperature T1, cooling radiatively at the other end. T 3 0 . If we choose a copper rod, κCu ≃ 400 Wm −1K−1 and a length of 1 cm, we ﬁnd that (using σ ≃ 6 × 10 −8 Wm −2K−4), T0 ≃ 10 4 K . Thus we anticipate that the radiative cooling is only eﬃcient when we are dealing with temperatures in that regime. Otherwise, there is almost no drop along the rod - since the very small gradient is enough to generate the weak thermal current to compensate for the very slow radiative loss. ♣ To be more accurate deﬁne the dimensionless temperature variables τi = Ti/T0. In terms of those variables we ﬁnd that Eq. (4.2) becomes: τ 4 2 = τ1 − τ2 . (4.3) Let us examine the two limits. When τ1 ≪ 1, which imples τ2 < τ1 ≪ 1, then the left hand side of Eq. (4.3) must be very small, so the dimensionless temperature diﬀerence along the rod must be very small. Motivated by that let us write τ2 = τ1 − δ , where δ ≪ τ1 . Upon substitution and only taking the leading term on the lhs of Eq. (4.3), we see: τ 4 1 ≃ τ1 − τ2 ⇒ τ2 ≃ τ1 − τ 4 1 . For example at T1 = 100 K, the drop, T1 − T2, in temperature along the rod is around 10 −4 K. 4 HEAT TRANSFER – SOLUTIONS 7 ♣ Turning to the other limit, τi ≫ 1, then to balance the lefthand and righthand sides of Eq. (4.3) we see that τ 4 2 ≃ τ1 so τ2 ≃ τ 1/4 1 ≪ τ1 , consistently. Clearly the copper rod would be a pool of molten copper ... but ...We plot the result for small and large τ ’s interpolated by hand! Figure 4.2: The reduced temperature τ2 as a function of τ1. This disparity in radiative versus conductive heat transfer is used in the homely example of a vacuum ﬂask, where there is vacuum between the outer casing and the container of the (hot or cold) liquid. Scientiﬁcally this is used in the storage of cold (cryogenic) liquids which would be gaseous at room temperature, eg N2 or He. You can these in use daily in Physics East. Problem 4.10 Thermal capacitors and inductors? The variables in Kirchhoﬀ’s laws are voltage drops, ∆V , across components and currents, I. The counterparts are temperature drops, ∆T , and heat currents, ˙Q. Kirchhoﬀ’s laws are: (i) voltage drops around a loop must equal zero (in the absence of time dependent magnetic ﬂuxes threading the circuit!); (ii) at junctions of the circuit, the sum of the currents must be zero (conservation of electric charge and no charge build up at junctions). The counterparts to these for thermal circuits are: (i) temperature drops round a thermal loop are zero; (ii) thermal currents at a node add to zero (again energy conserved and no temperature build up at junctions, at least in steady state). A diﬀerence between the two types of circuits is that in the electrical case the components (resistors etc) are \"lumped\", connected by wires of negligible resistance, capacitance etc. Whereas in the thermal case, one cannot usually disregard the thermal resistance of the \"wires\", the components are \"distributed\". For ac eﬀects, it is hard to construct exact counterparts to capacitors and inductors. The usual type of electrical capacitor is an object with (at least) two plates which cannot pass a dc current. I cannot think of a counterpart. There is a diﬀerent type of \"thermal capacitor\", 4 HEAT TRANSFER – SOLUTIONS 8 which for both numerical and practical reasons 1 does not normally have a counterpart in electrical circuits: a component in a circuit with a large heat capacity. However, although this will damp out thermal transients, it is irrelevant for dc thermal currents. For inductors again it is diﬃcult to construct something that resists a change in thermal current. But there have been some recent (not very easy) results which indicate this may be possible. It also seems that one can make thermal rectiﬁers ..... 1Thanks to Mark Colclough for a discussion on that point.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
