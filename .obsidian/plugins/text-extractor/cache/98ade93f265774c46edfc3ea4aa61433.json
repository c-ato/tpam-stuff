(a) What are the correct S.I. units of V t where V is volume and t is time? [6] 2. A projectile is ﬁred from ground level with speed 100ms−1 at an angle of π/4 radians to the horizontal. Neglecting air resistance and assuming the landscape over which the projectile travels is ﬂat, ﬁnd the total horizontal distance travelled by the projectile before landing. Take g = 10ms−2. [10] 3. Write down the unit vectors in polar coordinates er and eθ in terms of the Cartesian unit vectors i and j, where the polar coordinates are (r, θ). If θ depends on time t, write deθ dt in terms of er.

The speed of the drop’s progress U depends on the volume of the droplet V , the kinematic viscosity of water ν, the surface tension of water σ, the density of water ρ, the acceleration due to gravity g and the angle that the water’s surface makes with the surface of the glass θ. (a) What are the dimensions of U , V , ρ, g and θ? [5] 5. (a) What is Hooke’s law? [1] (b) A particle of mass m is attached by a horizontal spring to a ﬁxed point. The particle is set in motion along the line of the spring. The particle slides across a table with negligible friction. If a is the natural length of the spring, the spring constant is k, and x is the displacement of the particle from some ﬁxed point, then use Newton’s second law to determine a diﬀerential equation for x. [4] (c) A mechanical vibration is described by the diﬀerential equation d2x dt2 + α dx dt + ω2x = 0 where x is a displacement, t is time, and α and ω are constants. Let x = 1 and dx/dt = 0 at t = 0. (i) If α = 0 then determine an expression for x in terms of t. Describe brieﬂy the nature of this oscillation. [10] (ii) If α = 1 and ω = 1 then determine an expression for x in terms of t. Describe brieﬂy the nature of this oscillation. [10] ?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
