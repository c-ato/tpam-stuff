Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. Calculators may be used in this examination but must not be used to store text. Calculators with the ability to store text should have their memories deleted prior to the start of the examination. Page 1 Turn over Any Calculator Section A 1. (a) Is the following equation dimensionally homogeneous? dρ dx = m A + uV, where ρ is density, x is distance, m is mass, A is area, u is velocity and V is volume. Justify your answer. [4] (b) If a particle of mass m is subject to a force of the form F = kt2, where k is a constant and t is time, ﬁnd the acceleration, velocity and position of the particle, given the particle starts at x = 0 with constant velocity u. [12] (c) Starting from Newton’s Second Law, show that r × F = d dt (r × m˙r) , where r is position, F is force, m is mass and t is time. Give the physical meaning of each term in the expression in words. [10] (d) A particle of mass m is moving on a wire in the shape of a cosine wave in the x-z plane, where x, z are Cartesian coordinates in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively. (i) If x = aθ (t), z = c cos θ (t), where t is time and a, c are constants, ﬁnd the position vector and hence the velocity of the particle. (ii) Hence show that 1 2m ˙θ 2 ( a2 + c 2 sin2 θ ) + mgc cos θ = E, where E is a constant. [You may assume that Conservation of Energy holds for this system.] (iii) If the particle starts at the point x = 0, z = c moving with speed v, ﬁnd the value of E and hence show that the particle will never stop moving. [24] A29809 Page 2 Turn over Any Calculator Section B 2. A particle of mass m is attracted towards the origin O by a central force of magnitude mav2 8 ( 1 r2 + 3a r3 ) , where (r, θ ) are polar coordinates and a, v are positive constants. (a) Starting from Newton’s Second Law, show that the particle’s path satisﬁes d2u dθ 2 + u = av2 8h2 + 3a2v2 8h2 u, where u = 1/r and h is a constant which you should deﬁne. [You may use ˙r = r ˙θ eθ + ˙rer, ¨r = (¨r − r ˙θ 2) er + 1 r d dt ( r2 ˙θ ) eθ without proof.] [16] (b) If the particle starts at a distance a from the origin, moving with velocity ˙r = − v √ 2er + v √ 2eθ , ﬁnd expressions for u and du dθ at θ = 0, and the value of h. [10] (c) Hence ﬁnd the path of the particle. [14] (d) Determine the minimum distance between the particle and the origin on the ﬁrst revolution. How many revolutions are achieved before the particle ﬂies off to inﬁnity? What is the angle this happens at?
