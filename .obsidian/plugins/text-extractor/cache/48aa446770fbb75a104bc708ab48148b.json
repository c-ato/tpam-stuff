(Refer to the circuit diagram below for current labels.) I2 = I1 + I3 1.2 Apply Kirchhof f’s Voltage Law to the loop containing the 10V source, but not the 5V source. Which of the following equations is correct? 2I2 + 3I3 = 10 = 2I2 + I1 ⟹ 10 − 2I2 − I1 = 0 1.3 Apply Kirchhof f’s Voltage Law to the loop containing the 5V source, but not the 10V source. Which of the following equations is correct? 2I2 + 3I3 = 5 = I1 + 3I3 ⟹ I1 + 3I3 − 5 = 0 1.4 Use Kirchof f's laws to find the current in the 1Ω resistor in the circuit shown.} IA = 35 11 IB = 5 11 IC = 40 11 = 3.636 … A 3IA + IB = 10 IA + 4IB = 5 IA + IB = IC Year 1 Assessed Problems 4.pdf","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
