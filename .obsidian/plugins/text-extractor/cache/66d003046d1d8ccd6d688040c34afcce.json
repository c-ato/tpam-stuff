Preface In early August of 2017 David Ayala and Ryan Grady organized a CBMS conference on Topological and Geometric Methods in Quantum Field Theory at Montana State University in Bozeman. I gave a series of ten lectures which form the basis for this volume. There were supplementary lectures by several other mathematicians and physicists. Some of those are collected in a companion vol- ume [AFG]. Many students and postdocs attended, as did several more senior mathematicians. The beautiful natural setting and relaxed atmosphere were per- fect catalysts for interactions among the participants. I thank David and Ryan for their outstanding work bringing the conference together. Agnes Beaudry, Robert Bryant, Tudor Dimofte, Sam Gunningham, Max Metlitski, Dave Morrison, and Andy Neitzke gave terriﬁc lectures at the confer- ence. Beth Burroughs, Jane Crawford, and Katie Sutich in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at MSU provided massive assistance during the planning and execution of the conference. The College of Letters and Science and the VP of Research at Montana State University provided support for the CBMS conference as well. The Aspen Center for Physics provided me hospitality during the period when I wrote the ﬁrst draft of the lectures. I thank them all.

Introduction The motivating problem for these lectures comes from condensed matter physics: (‹) Classify invertible gapped phases of matter Phases of matter are familiar in everyday life. Ice, water, and vapor are diﬀerent forms of H2O, more diﬀerent from each other than, say, water at 10Cand water at 99 0C. If we consider “forms of H2O” as a function of temperature, then there are two special temperatures—00C and 1000C—at which there is a transition, from solid to liquid and from liquid to vapor. The real line of temperatures minus those two transition points has three path components: the three phases of solid, liquid, and vapor. In other words, forms of H2O connected continuously by a path are considered to be in the same phase. So far we have only introduced one parameter— temperature—with pressure ﬁxed to be the one you are experiencing right now. If we also allow pressure to vary, then there are only two phases of H2O. Our task is to (1) build a mathematical model of the physics problem, (2) solve the mathematics questions which arise in the model, and (3) apply the solution back to physics. This is the classic Three-Step Procedure of external applications of mathematics. From the example of H2O we see the outlines of a mathematical framework: there is a space M of “systems” with a “singular” locus Δ Ă M,and we are interested in π0pMzΔq. But what are the “systems”? How do we construct the space M which parametrizes them? And which systems are “singular”? What is clear is that problem (‹) is topological in nature. For example, the answer only depends on the homotopy type of MzΔ, so our solution need only construct a homotopy type, not a more precise algebraic or smooth space. There are many physical models of a given “system” in nature. They roughly fall into two boxes: discrete and continuous. Discrete models include various types of lattice models (discrete space, continuous time) and statistical mechanics models (discrete space, discrete time); they are prevalent in condensed matter physics. There is an extensive mathematical literature on these systems, but not as far as we know general deﬁnitions which apply directly to the problem at hand. (Nonetheless, Alexei Kitaev has made great strides in this direction.) Field theories, such as those of Maxwell and Einstein, are continuous models of nature. There are general physical principles which guide passage between discrete and continuous models. Our mathematical model of ‘phases of matter’ is grounded in ﬁeld theory, and more speciﬁcally in an Axiom System introduced by Graeme Segal. This structural vision of ﬁeld theory is the starting point for constructing a space M which parametrizes mathematical objects that in turn model some physical reality. The model retains minimal information—the long range physics—which on the one hand is robust 1 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 2 INTRODUCTION enough to determine the phase and on the other hand is ﬂabby enough to be amenable to topological techniques. These lectures are based on a joint paper [FH1] with Mike Hopkins. In these lectures we oﬀer complementary and supplementary background, motivation, and results; we leave out several detailed proofs which are in [FH1]. In this extended introduction we outline the lectures which make up this volume. The reader may wish to ﬂip back and forth between this broad idea sketch and the more detailed lectures which follow. Moduli spaces and deformation classes Problems analogous to (‹) are familiar in mathematics. As a simple example, ﬁx a positive integer n and let Mn be the space of conﬁgurations of n points on the real line R. The position of the i th pointisafunction xi : Mn Ñ R. Together the positions deﬁne an isomorphism px1,... ,xnq : Mn – ÝÝÑ Rn.We say Mn is the moduli space for this problem. There are natural “questions” which take the form of functions on Mn. ‘What is the distance between the 1st and 3 rd points?’ is the function |x1 ´ x3|. So far there is no interesting topology: Mn is contractible. Let Δ Ă Mn be the locus of n-tuples x “px1,...,xnq in which not all xi are distinct— the union of all diagonals. Conﬁgurations in MnzΔ satisfy a “gap condition”, and now there is nontrivial topology: MnzΔhas n! contractible components. A gapped conﬁguration x P MnzΔ determines a permutation σpxqP Symn,and the permutation is a complete invariant of the path component, or deformation class. In other words, σ : π0pMnzΔqÑ Symn is an isomorphism. It is worth pausing to contemplate the sophisticated mathematical theory un- derlying this example. Nowadays we conﬁdently write ‘R’ becausewehaveinhand a rich theory of real numbers. Historically it was not always so. Only after many hard-fought struggles and contradictions could victory be declared in the form of the three-word characterization of the real numbers: complete ordered ﬁeld.That profound hard-won phrase is the starting point of every undergraduate real analy- sis class. The order on the real numbers underlies the isomorphism σ. But do you see any inﬁnite decimals, Cauchy sequences, or Dedekind cuts? The topological problem ‘Compute π0pMnzΔq’ does not require such precision, whereas geometric questions about distance between points do. The characterization of the nature of real numbers is more useful for qualitative questions than any detailed construction would be. This toy problem exhibits several features common to moduli problems. First, there are discrete parameters, here the positive integer n. Second, there is a sin- gular locus Δ; oﬀ of Δ the parametrized objects satisfy a nonsingularity condition. Third, there are interesting functions on the moduli space which encode geometric information about the parametrized objects. Finally, there is a complete invariant of the deformation class, which is an isomorphism to a known or computable set. In this toy problem, as well as in problem (‹), there is a natural group structure: π0 is a group, not merely a set. (It should be said the group structure is not obvious if we view points of MnzΔ as conﬁgurations.) A known complete invariant of π0 is not present in all situations. As another example we might ask to parametrize “1-dimensional metric shapes”. This is ill-deﬁned as stated. Better said, it is not deﬁned as stated: to Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. INTRODUCTION 3 make a mathematical theory we must provide a deﬁnition. Whereas the real num- bers are characterized uniquely (complete ordered ﬁeld), here there is no unique- ness. Still, a deﬁnition should capture general features, even though it does not characterize. We might decide that, intuitively, we do not want to allow the 1- dimensional shape to cross itself. That is a “gap condition”. Once more there is a hard-won mathematical deﬁnition at hand: 1-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold. Furthermore, we know what a family of such objects is: a smooth ﬁber bundle π : X Ñ S with a Riemannian structure. (We leave the reader to ponder what the Riemannian structure is; the deﬁnition should lead to a unique Levi-Civita connection on the relative tangent bundle.) But now there is a second kind of “sin- gularity” which is still in the game. Namely, there exists a smooth ﬁber bundle over S “ R such that the ﬁber at s ă 0 is diﬀeomorphic to a circle and the ﬁber at s ą 0 is diﬀeomorphic to the disjoint union of two circles. The “singularity” at s “ 0 is a noncompact ﬁber: two lines. To rule out the transition from one circle to two circles, restrict to proper ﬁber bundles. Demanding compactness is again a kind of gap condition—think spectrum of the Laplace operator. The moduli space M of closed Riemannian 1-manifolds has all the features enumerated in the previous paragraph. The discrete parameter is the dimension, the singular locus was already eliminated, functions such as total length are interesting geometric in- variants, and the number of components is a complete invariant. There is a natural commutative monoid structure on π0M given by disjoint union, but there are no inverses and so π0M is not a group. Problem (‹) is about families of quantum mechanical systems. There is a basic dichotomy determined by the energy spectrum: a system is gapped if there is a gap in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian above the minimal energy and otherwise is gapless. This problem only considers gapped systems. In this context the singu- lar locus parametrizes phase transitions, which are bifurcated into ﬁrst-order and higher-order. A phase transition occurs along a path of gapped quantum systems when the energy gap is closed—the energy spectrum comes down to the minimum. If discrete spectrum goes down the transition is ﬁrst-order; if continuous spectrum, then it is higher-order. In any case we throw them all out and deﬁne two systems to be in the same phase if they can be joined by a continuous path of gapped systems with no phase transition. Problem (‹) includes another adjective—invertible— which we discuss below; the classiﬁcation question makes sense in the absence of invertibility. Of course, there are interesting analytic questions which are expressed in terms of correlation functions, which are functions on M, but problem (‹)is topological so we do not need anything so precise. The broad rough outline, then, is: construct a moduli space M for invertible gapped systems; throw out a locus Δ of phase transitions; compute π0pMzΔq. In fact, our transformation to a problem in ﬁeld theory obviates the need to consider Δ. Axiom System for ﬁeld theory As stated above, we attack (‹) by shifting to a problem in ﬁeld theory. Previ- ously we used ‘characterization’ and ‘deﬁnition’ as monikers for the mathematical starting point, but for ﬁeld theory we use ‘axiom system’. Why? Certainly there is not a unique ﬁeld theory, even with discrete parameters ﬁxed, so ‘characterization’ is inappropriate. We shy away from ‘deﬁnition’, which to our ears suggests stare de- cisis—settled law—and the situation for quantum ﬁeld theory is hardly that! Also, Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 4 INTRODUCTION the Axiom System for ﬁeld theory is perhaps more analogous to the Eilenberg- Steenrod axioms for (generalized) homology theories than, say, to the deﬁnition of a smooth Riemannian manifold. The Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, which do play the formal role of a ‘deﬁnition’, tell what a homology theory is without constructing one. Their power lies in their simplicity. One can check whether a construction satisﬁes the axioms, and in this way know that highly disparate constructions yield the same mathematical object, something that was not at all apparent before the Eilenberg-Steenrod 1945 paper. The analogy between pre-1945 algebraic topology and present-day quantum ﬁeld theory is not perfect, but consider the strong commonalities: multiple starting points, constructions, and approaches. The Axiom System for ﬁeld theory, intro- duced by Segal in the 1980s for conformal theories in two spacetime dimensions and later adapted by Atiyah for topological theories in all dimensions, is ﬂexible. It applies to both classical and quantum theories in all dimensions. In the Axiom System a ﬁeld theory is a map, and as such has a domain and codomain; part of the ﬂexibility is the freedom to vary them. The domain and codomain are each a symmetric monoidal category, and the map is a symmetric monoidal functor. The domain is a bordism category of smooth manifolds equipped with ﬁelds. ‘Field’ has a precise deﬁnition1 and includes traditional scalar ﬁelds of physics as well as topo- logical structures (orientation, spin structure) and more exotic possibilities. The codomain for a physically relevant ﬁeld theory is an appropriate category of complex topological vector spaces. This choice goes back to the early days of quantum me- chanics: linearity encodes superposition and complex numbers encode interference. Ergo the Axiom System in a nutshell: a ﬁeld theory is a linear representation of a geometric bordism category. Other choices for the codomain, such as the category of abelian groups, have proved useful in mathematical contexts. Indeed, the view- point of the Axiom System has proved its value many times over in mathematics: in low dimensional topology, symplectic geometry, geometric representation theory, category theory, etc. The story of these lectures is one small application to physics, and there are many more indications there of its pertinence and utility. However, it has not uniﬁed the disparate points of view on quantum ﬁeld theory, and there are few rigorous examples; in non-topological contexts the Axiom System is not as established as, say, the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms. We explain two routes to the Axiom System in these lectures. The ﬁrst route, explained in Lecture 1, is through classical bordism theory: a topological ﬁeld the- ory is a categoriﬁcation of a classical bordism invariant. The second is through quantum ﬁeld theory. An essential point is that what is being axiomatized is Wick- rotated quantum theory—physics with purely imaginary time. In Lecture 2 we in- troduce the basic characters in quantum theory in the context of quantum mechan- ics: states, observables, and correlation functions. In fact, we give a uniﬁed picture of mechanics—classical and quantum—which goes back to early mathematical work on quantum theory. Wick rotation is straightforward in quantum mechanics, and one can already see the Axiom System emerging in this 1-dimensional case of ﬁeld theory. Lecture 3 takes up relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, but only from a very structural perspective in order to explain where the Axiom Systems sits. Our start- ing point is deﬁnitely non-topological, so it is not surprising that the Axiom System applies to non-topological ﬁeld theories. Although we invoke non-topological ﬁeld 1which we do not include in these lectures; see [FT1, Appendix]. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. INTRODUCTION 5 theories at many points in the subsequent lectures, the technical work is for topo- logical ﬁeld theory. The reader might mistakenly infer from our words that the Wick-rotated non-topological theories we refer to, such as Yang-Mills ` Chern- Simons in three dimensions, are completely well-deﬁned objects which have been mathematically worked out. Not so! Even the topological parts of ﬁeld theory are under rapid development. The Axiom System is, in a sense, a Wick-rotated version of the Schr¨odinger approach to quantum mechanics and to quantum ﬁeld theory (Wightman et al.). That is, it emphasizes states and time-evolution of states, albeit imaginary time- evolution. By contrast, the Heisenberg approach to quantum mechanics emphasizes algebras of observables, as does that approach to quantum ﬁeld theory (Haag et al.). There are also modern mathematical axiom systems based on the Heisenberg approach, most prominently in work of Costello and collaborators. It should also be said that the Axiom System does not distinguish classical and quantum; a classical ﬁeld theory ﬁts the formal axioms as a very special case—classical ﬁeld theories are invertible. Many quantum theories have semiclassical limits in which they are described via quantization, say in terms of path integrals. Detailed descriptions in terms of ﬂuctuating ﬁelds furnish important information about a quantum ﬁeld theory, but they do not enter our approach to the classiﬁcation problem (‹). Nev- ertheless, one of the original goals of the Axiom System was precisely to capture the formal properties of canonical quantization and the path integral. Symmetries The sample moduli problems introduced above all have discrete parameters— number of points on a line, dimension of a Riemannian manifold—and a moduli space is constructed for ﬁxed values of these parameters. The discrete parameters in the phases of matter problem (‹) are the dimension of space and the symmetry group. Analogous parameters are present in eﬀective long-range ﬁeld theories, so it is important that we understand how these parameters manifest in the Axiom System. Dimension is a fundamental parameter evident in the domain bordism category. The dimension n, which is the dimension of spacetime, strongly aﬀects not only topological theories, but also analytic aspects of usual quantum ﬁeld theories. Symmetry is more complicated, and we devote much eﬀort in these lectures and in [FH1] to this topic. The initial arena for a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory is Minkowski space- time Mn,an n-dimensional aﬃne space equipped with a translation-invariant Lor- entz metric and a time-orientation. Its automorphism group In is the subgroup of the aﬃne group which preserves the metric and time-orientation. A quantum ﬁeld theory is a structure over Mn, so its automorphism group Gn comes equipped with a homomorphism ρ : Gn Ñ In. In other words, a symmetry of a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory induces a symmetry of the underlying spacetime. Relativistic invariance is the requirement that the image of ρ contain the identity component of the Lie group In. This geometrically natural setup places In or its identity component as a quotient of Gn, whereas in traditional approaches to quantum ﬁeld theory one assumes that the Poincar´e group is a subgroup of Gn. (The Poincar´e group is a double cover of the identity component of In.) In Lecture 3 we track symmetry through Wick rotation to Euclidean space and then to curved Riemann- ian manifolds. As we know from diﬀerential geometry, at this last stage it is natural Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 6 INTRODUCTION to divide by translations and use the quotient as the structure group of a smooth manifold. Doing so we obtain from Gn a compact Lie group Hn and a homomor- phism ρ : Hn Ñ On whose image is either SOn or On. We call the pair pHn,ρnq the symmetry type of the theory. It is an important discrete invariant in any ﬁeld theory; we advocate articulating it explicitly in every example. For the theories in these lectures Gn is a Lie group, but in general Gn may be a super Lie group and may include “higher” symmetries. In the Axiom System the symmetry type is manifest in the domain bordism category, which consists of Riemannian manifolds equipped with an Hn-structure in the sense of Cartan. In physics the Hn-structure is a “background ﬁeld”. For example, if Hn “ On ˆK for a compact Lie group K, then the background ﬁelds are a Riemannian metric and aprincipal K-bundle with connection. More general background ﬁelds can also be considered part of the “symmetry type” of a theory. But, as already stated, in these lectures we stick to compact Lie groups Hn and their associated background gauge ﬁelds and Riemannian metrics. The rigidity of compact Lie groups leads to general structure theorems (Propo- sition 3.16, Theorem 3.24) and to classiﬁcation theorems (Example 3.22, Theo- rem 10.2). The discrete parameters of dimension and symmetry type appear in our main theorems about invertible reﬂection positive ﬁeld theories (§8.6). Extended Locality In Minkowski spacetime Mn one expression of locality is that observables sup- ported in spacelike separated regions commute. After Wick rotating to Euclidean space En, every pair of regions is spacelike separated and so operators with disjoint supports commute. Another expression of locality in Mn is cluster decomposi- tion, a factorization property of correlation functions. The Axiom System for an n-dimensional Wick-rotated theory on Riemannian manifolds captures locality in codimension one. That is, if we cut a closed n-manifold X along a codimension one separating submanifold Y Ă X, so that we obtain two manifolds X1,X2 with common boundary Y , then a correlation function on X factors as a product of a correlation function on X1 and a correlation function on X2, assuming the supports of all observables are disjoint from Y . However, in all but exceptionally simple cases the correlation functions on X1,X2 are not complex numbers but rather lie in a complex vector space, the state space obtained by quantization on Y .Composi- tion in a bordism category encapsulates this factorization of manifolds. Since a ﬁeld theory is a functor out of a bordism category, the factorization of correlation functions in codimension one follows. The strong locality of quantum ﬁeld theory is perhaps more evident in the Haag approach, in which one essentially considers the theory built up from information on arbitrary open subsets of Mn. This suggests that in Wick-rotated ﬁeld theory one should be able to reconstruct everything from invariants attached to small balls. Starting with an n-manifold X, wemust makecutsin n “directions” to express X as a union of balls. An algebraic structure which encapsulates these cuts has n composition laws. In this way n-categories enter the picture: the domain of an extended ﬁeld theory is a bordism n-category. What is not known is a natural choice of codomain n-category, so that choice is left ﬂexible, though in physical examples it is still constrained by superposition and interference. An extended Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. INTRODUCTION 7 ﬁeld theory is then a symmetric monoidal functor between symmetric monoidal n-categories. Lecture 5 is an exposition of extended locality and the extended Axiom System. The ideas are most developed in topological ﬁeld theory. A basic theorem, the cobordism hypothesis, is a precise version of the statement that a ﬁeld theory can be reconstructed from its restriction to a small ball. (In a topological theory one usually shrinks the ball to a point.) Extended locality in this form was introduced in the mathematical literature in the early 1990s in connection with 3-dimensional quantum Chern-Simons theory. It appeared earlier in the physics literature in the form of extended observables, such as line operators. Invertibility and homotopy theory There is a composition law for quantum systems: conjunction without inter- action. The state space of the composite is the tensor product of constituent state spaces and the Hamiltonian is the sum of constituent Hamiltonians. In the (extended) Axiom System the symmetric monoidal structures on the domain and codomain categories as well as on the functor between them combine to give the Wick-rotated version of this composition law. The trivial theory is a unit for the composition law; on each closed space there is a single quantum state and zero Hamiltonian, and in terms of the Axiom System it is the theory whose values are tensor units. Thus invertibility is deﬁned. It is immediate that a theory is invert- ible if and only if it factors through the maximal subgroupoid of the codomain: the state space of every closed pn ´ 1q-manifold is 1-dimensional, for example. But then one can “localize” and factor through the groupoid quotient of the domain bordism category. In this way an invertible ﬁeld theory becomes a symmetric monoidal func- tor between (higher) Picard groupoids. (‘Picard’ is short for ‘symmetric monoidal with invertible objects’.) Enter stable homotopy theory. One passes freely between higher groupoids and topological spaces, or rather homotopy types, via the homotopy hypothesis. A Picard structure on a higher groupoid goes over to an inﬁnite loop structure on a topological space. After that transmogriﬁcation, an invertible ﬁeld theory is an inﬁnite loop map of inﬁnite loop spaces. This is a far cry from our starting point in physics(!), yet is the result of a step-by-step progression. So as not to muddy the mathematical waters, in Lecture 6 we take this homotopical incarnation of an invertible ﬁeld theory as an ansatz. But in reality it is a theorem derived from the Axiom System, at least for topological ﬁeld theories; we give appropriate references in that lecture. We begin in Lecture 6 with non-extended topological ﬁeld theories. In Theo- rem 6.27 we use an elementary Morse theory argument to prove that the partition function of an invertible ﬁeld theory is a bordism invariant. However, it is not in general a Thom bordism invariant, but rather a Reinhart bordism invariant. That same conclusion follows from a deeper theorem which identiﬁes the result of inverting all morphisms in a bordism n-category. It is the inﬁnite loop space associated to a Madsen-Tillmann spectrum, which is then the domain spectrum of a ﬁeld theory (Ansatz 6.89). Since we do not have in hand a canonical codomain n-category for a ﬁeld theory, we cannot take its maximal subgroupoid to deter- mine a canonical codomain spectrum for an invertible ﬁeld theory. However, there Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 8 INTRODUCTION is a natural choice for the codomain spectrum: the character dual to the sphere spectrum. It is characterized in ﬁeld-theoretic terms by the property that the par- tition function determines the theory, something not true in general but a desirable property. Magically, the boson/fermion dichotomy of states falls out automatically (Remark 6.91). At this point we have a homotopy type for a space of invertible topological ﬁeld theories, but for three reasons it is not the correct homotopy type to apply to problem (‹). First, the topology is wrong: π0 is the abelian group of isomorphism classes of topological theories, not the group of deformation classes. It is as if we ask about deformation classes of nonzero complex numbers but use the discrete topology rather than the usual continuous topology. We introduce the Anderson dual to the sphere spectrum as a substitute for the continuous topology; see §6.8. This leads us to introduce continuous invertible topological ﬁeld theories (§6.10), which we argue capture the deformation class of an invertible theory. The second consideration which tells we have the wrong homotopy type is that the low-energy description of an invertible gapped quantum system is not necessarily a discrete topological theory, as we discuss below. And, importantly, the Axiom System does not incorporate unitarity, an important property of quantum systems to which we now turn. Extended unitarity The two pillars of quantum ﬁeld theory are locality and unitarity. We explained above that a strong form of locality is implemented in Wick-rotated ﬁeld theory by an extended Axiom System. Our mission now is to implement unitarity in the Axiom System, both in non-extended and extended forms, a topic we take up in Lecture 7 and Lecture 8, respectively. We only succeed in deﬁning extended unitarity for invertible topological ﬁeld theories; it is an interesting open question to deﬁne extended unitarity in general. It is well-known that reﬂection positivity in Euclidean ﬁeld theory is the Wick- rotated manifestation of unitarity in relativistic ﬁeld theory. In fact, reﬂection and positivity are separate concepts. In the non-extended version discussed in Lecture 7, reﬂection is a structure and positivity is a condition. Reﬂection is implemented in the Axiom System as an involution on both the domain bordism category and the codomain category of complex vector spaces. If the domain consists of oriented manifolds, then the reﬂection involution is orientation-reversal. We deﬁne an ana- log for any symmetry type pHn,ρnq in terms of a co-extension of the Lie group Hn; see Theorem 7.13. On the codomain the reﬂection involution is complex conjuga- tion. A reﬂection structure is equivariance data for the functor which deﬁnes the ﬁeld theory. This realizes the slogan “orientation-reversal maps to complex conju- gation”. A reﬂection structure induces a nondegenerate hermitian inner product on the state space attached to every closed pn ´ 1q-manifold. In a non-extended theory positivity is the requirement that all of these hermitian inner products be positive deﬁnite. The reﬂection structure/positivity condition in the Axiom System on curved manifolds is a direct generalization of standard reﬂection positivity in Euclidean ﬁeld theory. In Lecture 8 we narrow the focus to invertible topological ﬁeld theories. Recall that we model an extended invertible theory in stable homotopy theory as a map between appropriate spectra. An extended reﬂection structure in this invertible case Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. INTRODUCTION 9 is a lift of this map to an equivariant map between spectra with involutions. We give arguments to justify speciﬁc involutions in the domain and codomain, as appear in (8.45), (8.46). Not surprisingly, extended positivity is no longer just a condition in codimension one; it is also data in lower codimensions. To formulate it in our stable homotopy world, we ﬁrst recast naive positivity of hermitian inner products in categorical terms (§7.1). This motivates the involution which models complex conjugation (§8.3), Deﬁnition 8.33 of a spectrum of positive deﬁnite Hermitian lines, and ﬁnally Deﬁnitions 8.53 and 8.55 of a space, or homotopy type, of reﬂection positive invertible topological ﬁeld theories of ﬁxed dimension and symmetry type. It turns out that for an extended invertible n-dimensional ﬁeld theory with reﬂection structure, an extended positivity structure is a trivialization of an associated “real” pn ´ 1q-dimensional ﬁeld theory (Deﬁnition 8.62). Non-topological invertible theories Throughout the lectures we use non-topological ﬁeld theories to guide our mod- eling, although the mathematical theorems pertain only to topological theories. Non-topological invertible ﬁeld theories are relevant for the solution to (‹), as we explain in Lecture 9. A standard hypothesis is that some long range behavior of a physical system, including its phase, is captured by a scale-invariant ﬁeld the- ory. If the physical system is gapped, then this eﬀective ﬁeld theory is almost topological, but it may be oﬀ by a non-topological invertible theory; we coin the term “topological˚” for this class of theories. If the entire eﬀective ﬁeld theory is invertible, then there is no reason for it to be topological. So to solve (‹)we should produce a homotopy type of not-necessarily-topological invertible reﬂection positive theories. What we argue in Lecture 9 is that this is the homotopy type of continuous invertible reﬂection positive theories. Our proposal (Conjecture 9.34) has a more speciﬁc incarnation: invertible not-necessarily-topological ﬁeld theories correspond to appropriate cocycles for generalized diﬀerential cohomology.The partition function of a theory is a secondary geometric invariant, the “integral” of a generalized diﬀerential cohomology class, and the theory itself provides a fully local description of the secondary invariant. A typical example is the exponentiated η-invariant of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer, which from this point of view is fully local. Theorems At this point we have carried out the First Step in the Three-Step Procedure of applications of mathematics: we have built a mathematical model of the physics problem (‹). That model consists of a well-deﬁned homotopy type M of appro- priate ﬁeld theories. The Second Step is to prove mathematical theorems which determine π0M.In §8.6 we state these results but do not include the proofs, which may be found in [FH1, §8]. We not only determine π0 but identify the entire homotopy type in familiar terms, namely as maps from a Thom spectrum to the Anderson dual to the sphere spectrum. (This is the answer for continuous theories; for discrete theories there is a slightly more complicated answer.) Therefore, the entire eﬀect of imposing unitarity in its Wick-rotated manifestation is to replace a Madsen-Tillmann spectrum by a Thom spectrum. We remark that in our general study of symmetry we prove (Theorem 3.24) that a symmetry type pHn,ρnq has a stabilization pH, ρq as n Ñ8. This produces a sequence (8.7) of Madsen-Tillmann Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 10 INTRODUCTION spectra which limit to a Thom spectrum, and leads to the notion of a stable invert- ible topological ﬁeld theory, i.e., one which factors through the Thom spectrum. Thus a reﬂection positive continuous invertible theory is stable. Part B of the Second Step in the Three-Step Procedure is to compute the abelian group π0M of deformation classes for physically relevant values of the dis- crete parameters (dimension and symmetry type). Fortunately, the mathematical techniques to make the computations are already well-developed. A major tool is the Adams spectral sequence, but it is not the only one. In Lecture 10 we present some special computations; many more computations are contained in the references, which also include pedagogical introductions to the Adams spectral se- quence. While these are the mathematical theorems and techniques directly applicable to (‹), we also take the opportunity to present other classiﬁcation theorems in Lecture 4. The main techniques there are Morse and Cerf theory, not homotopy theory. The ﬁrst theorem of this type is the classiﬁcation of oriented 2-dimensional topological theories in terms of Frobenius algebras. We quote without proof an analogous result in a non-topological case, but where the theory only depends on an area form, not on a full Riemannian metric. We also sketch the proof of a 1-dimensional case of the cobordism hypothesis. Free spinor ﬁelds We are ready for Step Three of the Three-Step Procedure: application of the mathematical theorems to the physics problem (‹). We test our theorems and homotopy theoretical computations against known results in the physics literature, and we also derive new results. What is known and what is new is entirely a function of the discrete parameters: dimension and symmetry type. To apply our ﬁeld theoretic theorems to discrete systems in condensed matter physics, we must understand how these parameters match up in the two descriptions of the same physical system; this is one of the topics treated in §9.1. The condensed matter literature primarily deals with spatial dimensions d “ 0, 1, 2, 3, which of course corresponds to spacetime dimensions n “ 1, 2, 3, 4. There are many computations in the physics literature for various symmetry types in varying dimension. By now many of the corresponding homotopy theoretic computations have been made, and there is complete agreement; see the references to Lecture 10. New results have also been obtained, and essentially any case in low dimensions can be computed on demand by an appropriately skilled young homotopy theorist. In Lecture 10 we focus on symmetry types for which there is a notion of a “free fermion” system. There is a map from free systems to interacting systems, and thus three pieces of data for each symmetry type: the map from free to interacting together with its domain and codomain. Hence for these special symmetry types the test against physics literature is richer; for other symmetry types there is only one piece of data to check. Our ﬁrst task is to classify appropriate symmetry types. It turns out there are ten of them (Theorem 10.2), another instance of the famous 10-fold way, which goes back to Dyson. We remark that the two ﬂavors of pin group occur among the ten fermionic symmetry types, and our ideas about free fermions provide insight into the theory of Dirac operators on pin manifolds. A classical free fermion ﬁeld theory, massless or massive, is speciﬁed by an appropriate Cliﬀord module, as we recount in §10.2. The crucial Lemma 10.21 tells how a nondegenerate Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. INTRODUCTION 11 mass is equivalent to an extra Cliﬀord generator. To pass from the classical free fermion to its free ﬁeld quantization requires a choice beyond the Cliﬀord data, as we explain shortly in the discussion about anomalies. In the massive case, which is the eﬀective ﬁeld theory of a gapped free fermion lattice system, Conjecture 10.25 tells the deformation class of the invertible low energy approximation in terms of the Cliﬀord data. The conjectural formula employs (1) the connection between Cliﬀord modules and KO-theory, and (2) the map from spin bordism to KO-theory, both of which were elucidated by Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro. In §10.3 we present the results of computations for two of the ten symmetry types. Anomalies Bonus Lecture 11 is a piece on the general topic of anomalies in quantum ﬁeld theory; it was not part of the CBMS conference. There is a rich theory of anomalies which exhibits a multitude of approaches. We focus on geometric aspects, a point of view which ﬁts in best with these lectures. Also, we use free spinor ﬁelds as motivation for the discussion of anomalies in general. The modern view on anom- alies is: to an n-dimensional ﬁeld theory F is canonically attached a truncated invertible pn ` 1q-dimensional ﬁeld theory αF ,its anomaly. (The truncation means we only evaluate on manifolds of dimension ď n; in many cases αF extends to a full non-truncated theory.) This is half of Thesis 11.29. The other half asserts that to produce a well-deﬁned quantum ﬁeld theory one must specify a trivialization τ of the anomaly αF . The ratio of two trivializations is an invertible n-dimensional ﬁeld theory δ. Often what appears to be natural to deﬁne is the relative theory F with anomaly αF ; an absolute theory τ ˝ F is only determined up to tensoring by an invertible theory δ. Quantum mechanics illustrates this indeterminacy (Exam- ple 11.34); shifting by δ tensors the state space by a line and shifts the energy by a constant. This indeterminacy also helps explain why a gapped physical system may have an eﬀective long range ﬁeld theory which is topological only up to tensoring by a possibly-non-topological invertible theory. We return to free massive spinor ﬁelds in Example 11.36. We explain how to an n-dimensional massive free spinor ﬁeld theory is canonically associated an pn ´ 1q- dimensional massless free spinor ﬁeld theory. The n-dimensional anomaly theory of the latter is a canonical choice for the long range eﬀective ﬁeld theory of the former. It is this choice which is used in Conjecture 10.25. This maneuver implicitly deﬁnes a canonical trivialization τ of the anomaly of a massive free spinor ﬁeld theory, but in families of theories—for example with variable mass—one does not necessarily use this canonical choice. Final remarks An appendix to the lectures summarizes some relevant facts about 1-categories. In these lectures we treat higher categories heuristically and leave the full theory, including construction of models, to the literature. Problem (‹) concerns physical systems which exist on any manifold which rep- resents space. One can also ask for the classiﬁcation of phases on a particular space: Classify invertible gapped phases of matter on a space Y , possibly with group action(‹‹) Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 12 INTRODUCTION The theory developed in [FH1], recounted in these lectures, leads to a solution to problem (‹‹), again based on ﬁeld theoretic ideas. The answer is a Borel-Moore (Borel equivariant) homology group of Y , as we explain in [FH3]. As should be crystal clear by now, these lectures are based on joint work with Mike Hopkins, whom I thank for many enjoyable collaborations. He and several other confederates and correspondents—including the Aspen 7 Gang—Mike Freed- man, Anton Kapustin, Alexei Kitaev, Greg Moore, and Constantin Teleman, in addition to Mike Hopkins and me; David Ben-Zvi; Jonathan Campbell; Jacques Distler; Davide Gaiotto; Zheng-Cheng Gu; Matt Hastings; Jacob Lurie; Max Metl- itski; Andy Neitzke; Graeme Segal; Nati Seiberg; Stephan Stolz; Peter Teichner; Ulrike Tillmann; Senthil Todadri; Kevin Walker; Xiao-Gang Wen; and Ed Witten— have inﬂuenced the ideas and work recounted in these lectures, though none of them should be held responsible for any errors of fact or judgment.

LECTURE 1 Bordism and Topological Field Theories Bordism is a notion which can be traced back to Henri Poincar´eatthe endof the 19th century, but it comes into its own mid-20 th century in the hands of Lev Pontrjagin [P]and Ren´eThom[T]. Poincar´e originally tried to develop homology theory using smooth manifolds, but eventually simplices were used instead. Recall that a singular q-chain in a topological space S is a formal sum of continuous maps Δ q Ñ S from the standard q-simplex. There is a boundary operation B on q-chains, constructed by restriction to the boundary of Δq,and a q-chain c is a cycle if Bc “ 0; a cycle c is a boundary if there exists a pq ` 1q-chain b with Bb “ c. If S is a point, then every cycle of positive dimension is a boundary. In other words, abstract chains carry no information. In bordism theory one replaces cycles by closed smooth manifolds mapping continuously into S. A chain is replaced by a compact smooth manifold X and a continuous map X Ñ S; the boundary of this chain is the restriction BX Ñ S to the boundary. Now there is information even if S “ pt. For not every closed smooth manifold is the boundary of a compact smooth manifold. For example, Y “ RP 2 is not the boundary of a compact 3- manifold. We begin in §1.1 by using bordism to construct an equivalence relation on closed manifolds, and so obtain sets of bordism classes of manifolds. There is an algebraic structure: the set of bordism classes is an abelian group with group law derived from disjoint union. These ideas date from the 1950s. A modern take on bordism extracts more intricate algebraic gadgets from smooth manifolds: categories and their more complicated cousins. (See Appendix A for a review of the relevant algebra.) In this context the analog of a classical bordism invariant, such as the signature of a manifold, is a topological ﬁeld theory. The bordism category—but not topological ﬁeld theories—already appeared in the classic book [Mi3, §1]. In §1.2 we use bordism as a quick route to the Axiom System for ﬁeld theories. In Lecture 2 and Lecture 3 we will see how these same axioms arise from quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory. In this lecture we give several examples in the topological framework, including the basic Example 1.23. In §1.3 we introduce “tangential” structures into bordism and topological ﬁeld theory, though in the generality we consider they need hardly relate to intrinsic geometry. In §1.5 we leave ﬁeld theory to recall the Pontrjagin-Thom theorem, the basic relationship between bordism and stable homotopy theory. It will be used in our study of invertible ﬁeld theories, beginning in Lecture 6. Thecoursenotes [F1] contain more details on much of this material. 13 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 14 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES 1.1. Classical bordism All manifolds in these lectures are smooth, perhaps with boundary or corners, and maps between manifolds are also smooth. A manifold is closed if it is compact without boundary. Fix an integer d ě 0. θ0 [0, 1) × Y0 (−1, 0] × Y1 X (∂X)0 (∂X)1 θ1 Figure 1.1. X is a bordism from Y0 to Y1 Definition 1.1. Let Y0,Y1 be closed d-manifolds. A bordism `X, p , θ0 ,θ1˘ from Y0 to Y1 consists of a compact pd ` 1q-manifold X with boundary, a partition p : BX Ñt0, 1u of BX, and embeddings θ0 : r0, `1qˆ Y0 ÝÑ X(1.2) θ1 : p´1, 0sˆ Y1 ÝÑ X(1.3) with disjoint images, such that θip0,Yiq“pBXqi, i “ 0, 1, where pBXqi “ p´1piq. Each of pBXq0, pBXq1 is a union of components of BX; note that there is a ﬁnite number of components since X,and so too BX, is compact. Terminology: pBXq0 is the incoming boundary and pBXq1 the outgoing boundary.The map θi is a dif- feomorphism onto its image, which is a collar neighborhood of pBXqi;we require that the closures of the images of θ1 and θ2 are disjoint. The collar neighborhoods are included to make it easy to glue bordisms. The ﬁrst drawing in Figure 1.1 illustrates the deﬁnition, but we picture a bordism more simply as the second in which we drop the collars. The arrows on the boundary encode the value of p.If the context is clear, we notate a bordism `X, p , θ0 ,θ1˘ as ‘X’. The dual bordism X _ “ `X _ ,p_ ,θ_ 0 ,θ_ 1 ˘ from Y1 to Y0 is the same underlying manifold X _ “ X, but with p_ “ 1 ´ p: reverse the arrow at each boundary component. Definition 1.4. Closed d-manifolds Y0,Y1 are bordant if there exists a bor- dism X from Y0 to Y1. Exercise 1.5. Prove that bordism is an equivalence relation. Write carefully the details of the transitivity property, for which Figure 1.2 will be helpful. Exercise 1.6. Show that diﬀeomorphic d-manifolds are bordant.

BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES 15 θ0 [0, 1) × Y0 (−1, 1) × Y1 (−1, 0] × Y2 X X′ θ′ θ′ θ1 10 Figure 1.2. Gluing bordisms Let Ωd denote the set of equivalence classes of closed d-manifolds under the equivalence relation of bordism. An element of Ωd is called a bordism class.The empty manifold ∅ d is a special element of Ωd, so we may consider Ωd as a pointed set. (We let ‘∅ d’ denote the empty set with the structure of a d-dimensional smooth manifold.) Disjoint union is an operation on manifolds which passes to bordism classes: if Y0 is bordant to Y 1 0 and Y1 is bordant to Y 1 1,then Y0 > Y1 is bordant to Y 1 0 > Y 1 1 .So pΩd, >q is a commutative monoid. 2 The identity element is represented by ∅d.A null bordant manifold is one which is bordant to ∅d.In fact, pΩd, >q is an abelian group: every element is invertible—in fact of order at most two—since for any closed d-manifold Y , the disjoint union Y > Y is null-bordant via the null bordism r0, 1sˆ Y . The abelian group pΩd, >q is ﬁnitely generated, though we do not prove that here. Denote this abelian group as ‘Ωd’. In §1.3 we discuss bordism of manifolds with general tangential structure. An important special case is an orientation. Thus in Deﬁnition 1.1 we can take Y0,Y1,X oriented and ask that the maps θ0,θ1 be orientation-preserving, where in the domains we use the Cartesian product orientations. The resulting bordism groups are denoted 3 ‘ΩdpSOq’. Definition 1.7. A classical bordism invariant of oriented manifolds is a ho- momorphism (1.8) f :ΩdpSOqÝÑ Z. For example, the signature Sign : Ω4kpSOqÑ Z plays an important role in classical manifold theory. There are many other important bordism invariants in geometry, including the ˆA-genus ˆA :Ω4kpSpinqÑ Z in spin geometry and index theory, as 2A commutative monoid is a set with a commutative, associative composition law and identity element. 3For consistency, then, the unoriented bordism groups may be denoted ‘ΩdpOq’. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 16 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES well as the Todd genus Todd : Ω2kpUqÑ Z in complex geometry. The latter and its cousins encode enumerative invariants of complex manifolds. Remark 1.9. One needn’t choose the codomain to be Z; there are also impor- tant Z{2Z-valued bordism invariants, as in Exercise 1.10 and Example 1.59. Exercise 1.10. Prove that the mod 2 Euler number deﬁnes a bordism invariant ΩdpOqÑ Z{2Z. On the other hand, show that the integer-valued Euler number is not generally a bordism invariant. Remark 1.11. Bordism invariants with ﬁxed domain (tangential structure) and codomain form an abelian group, e.g., Hom `ΩdpSOq, Z˘ . 1.2. Topological ﬁeld theories In this section we promote bordism from a condition to data. This process is oftenreferredtoas categoriﬁcation:4 rather than a set of equivalence classes of closed d-manifolds, we construct a bordism category5 whose objects are closed d-manifolds and whose morphisms keep track of bordisms between them. The categoriﬁcation of a classical bordism invariant (Deﬁnition 1.7) is a topological ﬁeld theory. Set n “ d ` 1 so that bordisms between d-manifolds are n-dimensional. 6 As our emphasis moves from the d-manifolds to the bordisms between them, we phase out ‘d’ and use ‘n’instead. Suppose X “pX, p, θ0,θ1q and X 1 “pX 1,p1,θ1 0,θ1 1q are bordisms from Y0 to Y1. A diﬀeomorphism F : X Ñ X 1 is a diﬀeomorphism of manifolds with boundary which commutes with the structure maps. Definition 1.12. Fix n P Zě0.The bordism category Bordxn´1,ny is the sym- metric monoidal category deﬁned as follows. (1) Objects are closed pn ´ 1q-manifolds. (2) Morphisms in Bordxn´1,nypY0,Y1q are diﬀeomorphism classes of bordisms X : Y0 Ñ Y1. (3) Composition of morphisms is by gluing (Figure 1.2). (4) For each Y the bordism r0, 1sˆ Y is the identity morphism idY : Y Ñ Y . (5) The monoidal product is disjoint union. (6) The empty manifold ∅n´1 is the tensor unit. Even though technically we take an object to be an pn´1q-manifold Y , conceptually we think of Y as coming with an embedding into an n-manifold, or better a germ of an embedding. Germs of collar neighborhoods allow us to glue along open sets, as in Figure 1.2. When we add n-dimensional structures to the manifolds in §1.3, then we will necessarily have to thicken up the pn ´ 1q-dimensional objects. In this topological setting it is enough to “thicken up” the tangent bundle TY Ñ Y , 4Historically, one of the ﬁrst examples of categoriﬁcation is the passage from Betti numbers to (Noether) homology groups. Atiyah’s question in the early 1960s—Why is the ˆA-genus of a spin manifold an integer?—was one impetus for another important example of categoriﬁcation: the construction/rediscovery by Atiyah-Singer of the Dirac operator on a Riemannian spin manifold and the identiﬁcation of the ˆA-genus as the dimension of a super vector space. 5See Appendix A for some basics about categories. 6In the physics setting, d is the dimension of space and n the dimension of spacetime.

BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES 17 replacing it by the rank n bundle R ‘ TY Ñ Y , but in the geometric setting we encounter in later lectures we use germs of n-manifolds [Se3, ST]. Exercise 1.13. For each object Y in Bordxn´1,ny let Diﬀ Y denote the group of diﬀeomorphisms of Y . Construct a homomorphism (1.14) π0pDiﬀ Y qÑ Bordxn´1,nypY, Y q by constructing a bordism Xf “pXf ,p,θ0,θ1q associated to a diﬀeomorphism f : Y Ñ Y . Is (1.14) necessarily injective? X X ∨ Figure 1.3. Some bordisms in Bordx1,2y Exercise 1.15 (Bordx1,2y). Objects are closed 1-manifolds, so ﬁnite unions of circles. As depicted in Figure 1.3 the cylinder can be interpreted as a bordism X : pS1q>2 Ñ ∅ 1; the dual bordism X _ is a map X _ : ∅1 ÑpS1q>2.Let ρ : S1 Ñ S1 be reﬂection; set f “ 1>ρ, a diﬀeomorphism of pS1q>2; and let Xf be the associated bordism (Exercise 1.13). Then verify (1.16) X ˝ Xid ˝ X _ – torus X ˝ Xf ˝ X _ – Klein bottle These diﬀeomorphisms become equations in the monoid Bordx1,2yp∅1, ∅ 1q of dif- feomorphism classes of closed 2-manifolds. Let VectC be the symmetric monoidal category whose objects are complex vector spaces and whose morphisms are linear maps. The monoidal product is the tensor product of vector spaces. We may consider 7 VectC to be a categoriﬁcation of the abelian group Z. The following deﬁnition8 categoriﬁes Deﬁnition 1.7 of a classical bordism invariant. Axiom System 1.17 (Topological ﬁeld theory). Fix n P Zě0.An n-dimen- sional topological ﬁeld theory is a symmetric monoidal functor (1.18) F :Bordxn´1,ny ÝÑ VectC . Such a functor attaches to each closed pn ´ 1q-manifold Y a vector space F pY q and to each bordism X : Y0 Ñ Y1 a linear map F pXq : F pY0qÑ F pY1q. Gluings of bor- disms map to compositions of linear maps, disjoint unions map to tensor products, the tensor unit ∅ n´1 maps to the tensor unit C, and so a closed n-manifold X maps to a complex number F pXq. Anticipating the physics terminology, the vector space F pY q is the state space and the number F pXq the partition function. 7But it does not stand up to scrutiny: (i) equivalence classes of objects under isomorphism form the commutative monoid Zě0; and (ii) the monoidal structure we use, tensor product, categoriﬁes multiplication in Z, not addition. Nonetheless, it is a useful motivation for Axiom System 1.17. 8We use ‘Axiom System’ in place of ‘Deﬁnition’ with an eye to our later, non-topological, context in which the Axiom System (§3.1) is not meant to be the ﬁnal word on a mathematical deﬁnition of quantum ﬁeld theory. For topological ﬁeld theories the mathematical underpinnings are much more developed, and we would use ‘Deﬁnition’ were it not for the broader context. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 18 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES Remark 1.19. There are many variations of Axiom System 1.17 in these lec- tures. For example, we will consider theories of manifolds with tangential structure, such as orientation. Also, analogous to Remark 1.9, we can vary the codomain: for example, as in the passage from Betti numbers to homology groups we can re- place VectC with the symmetric monoidal category Ab of abelian groups under tensor product. Our choice VectC comes from quantum mechanics: the linearity of vector spaces encodes superposition and the complex numbers encode interference. In Lecture 6 we will implement an extended notion of locality in which we move from categories to n-categories. Then in Lecture 8 we implement unitarity.Even more fundamentally, Axiom System 1.17 is stated for topological ﬁeld theories. There are extensions for non-topological theories, which of course is the typical case of phys- ical interest. The original formulation of the Axiom System is for 2-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories and is due to Segal [Se1]. The topological version is due to Atiyah [A1]. For this reason the term ‘Atiyah-Segal Axioms’ is sometimes used for Axiom System 1.17. e cY Figure 1.4. Evaluation e and coevaluation c morphisms for Y “ S1 Duality places stringent ﬁniteness restrictions on topological ﬁeld theories. (See §A.2 in the appendix for a review of duality in symmetric monoidal categories.) The main observation is quite simple. Figure 1.5. The S-diagram argument Lemma 1.20. Every object Y in the bordism category Bordxn´1,ny is dualizable. The dual object Y _ “ Y ; the evaluation and coevaluation bordisms are depicted in Figure 1.4. The compositions (A.29) are the cylinder as a bordism Y Ñ Y ,which is the identity map idY in the bordism category (Deﬁnition 1.12). This is often referred to as the “S-diagram argument” in view of Figure 1.5. The image of a dualizable object under a symmetric monoidal functor is dualizable, from which we deduce the following. Corollary 1.21. Let F :Bordxn´1,ny ÝÑ VectC be a topological ﬁeld theory. Then for all objects Y P Bordxn´1,ny, the vector space F pY q is ﬁnite dimensional. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES 19 Exercise 1.22. Prove that if an object V in VectC is dualizable, then V is ﬁnite dimensional, and then provide a complete proof of Corollary 1.21. Next, we give an important example of a topological ﬁeld theory. In the high energy physics literature it appears in a paper of Dijkgraaf-Witten [DW]; it appears in nascent form earlier in the condensed matter literature [We]. See [FQ]for careful proofs of the gluing laws which show that this ﬁnite gauge theory satisﬁes Axiom System 1.17. The lecture notes [HL] contain a more modern exposition and place the “ﬁnite path integral” (1.27) below in a proper categorical setting. Example 1.23 (Finite gauge theory). Fix a ﬁnite group G. For any topological space S there is an associated groupoid BunGpSq whose objects are principal G- bundles over S and whose morphisms are isomorphisms of G-bundles covering idS. A continuous map f : S1 Ñ S induces f ˚ :BunGpSqÑ BunGpS1q by pullback. In particular, a bordism X : Y0 Ñ Y1 in Bordxn´1,ny induces a correspondence (1.24) BunGpXq s \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 t \u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003 BunGpY0q BunGpY1q in which the source and target maps are restriction to the incoming and outgoing boundary components. The ﬁnite gauge theory (1.25) GG :Bordxn´1,ny ÝÑ VectC linearizes this correspondence diagram. Namely, let (1.26) GGpY q“ Map `BunGpY q, C˘ ,Y an object of Bordxn´1,ny, be the vector space of functions 9 of G-bundles and let (1.27) GGpXq“ t˚ ˝ s˚ be the composition of pullback and pushforward of functions. The ﬁbers of t are ﬁnite, so the pushforward of a function is computed by a ﬁnite sum, but the ﬁber is a groupoid and so that sum must be normalized: if G is a groupoid whose set π0G of equivalence classes is ﬁnite and if the automorphism group Autpxq of any object x is ﬁnite, then the sum/integral/pushforward of a function f : G Ñ C is (1.28) ÿ rxsPπ0G f pxq #Autpxq . The sum is over representatives of equivalence classes of objects. In particular, if X is a closed n-manifold, then the partition function GGpXqP C counts the G-bundles on X weighted by the inverse number of automorphisms: (1.29) GGpXq“ ÿ rP sPπ0 BunGpXq 1 #Aut P . Notice that a variant of GG exists with codomain the symmetric monoidal cate- gory VectQ of rational vector spaces. 9A function is a functor from BunGpY q to the category with set of objects C and only identity morphisms, which amounts to a function on equivalence classes of G-bundles.

The pushforward t˚ in (1.27) is a ﬁnite version of the Feynman path10 integral.The G-bundle is a ﬂuctuating,or quantum ﬁeld, and it is summed over so does not appear in the domain of (1.25). Exercise 1.31. Prove that (1.26) and (1.27) deﬁne a symmetric monoidal functor. To check compositions you’ll need to prove that for a composition of bordisms the correspondences (1.24) compose by ﬁber product; see [FQ]. Exercise 1.32. Compute the partition function of a closed connected n-mani- fold X. Hint: Choose a basepoint and construct a presentation of BunGpXq using the theory of covering spaces and the fundamental group. As in Remark 1.11 we can consider the collection of ﬁeld theories with ﬁxed domain and codomain. This collection (1.33) TFTxn´1,ny “ Hom `Bordxn´1,ny, VectC˘ of symmetric monoidal functors forms a symmetric monoidal category: given theo- ries F1,F2 there is a tensor product theory F1 b F2 deﬁned object-wise. The tensor unit theory 1 assigns the vector space C to every closed pn ´ 1q-manifold and idC to every n-dimensional bordism. The set of morphisms from F1 to F2 is the set of natural transformations between the functors. The state space attached to a closed pn ´ 1q-manifold Y is the tensor product F1pY qb F2pY q and the linear map attached to a bordism X is the tensor product F1pXqb F2pXq of linear maps. This monoidal structure has a manifestation in physical systems; see Remark 2.10 and Remark 2.14. In this topological case we have the following strong consequence of duality. Proposition 1.34. A morphism pη : F Ñ GqP TFTxn´1,ny is invertible: TFTxn´1,ny is a groupoid. This follows from Proposition A.44(2), since every object in the bordism category is dualizable (Lemma 1.20). 1.3. Structures on manifolds; further examples Tangential structures on smooth manifolds are incorporated into bordism the- ory from the beginning. We have already mentioned orientations. Other common examples are spin structures, framings, and almost complex structures. Given a topological space S we can have a structure on an n-manifold X which is a con- tinuous map X Ñ S. In the physics context these structures are background ﬁelds, and we will later use rigid geometric models; see §3.5. In our current topological context we take a ﬂabbier approach. Asmooth n-manifold X has a rank n real tangent bundle TX Ñ X.Choose a universal rank n real vector bundle (1.35) Wn ÝÑ BGLn R. Recall that a classifying bundle EH Ñ BH for a Lie group H is a topological prin- cipal H-bundle with the property that EH is contractible (and a suﬃciently nice11 topological space). The homotopy type of BH is independent of the realization. 10It is better called the Feynman functional integral. In quantum mechanics, as ﬁrst consid- ered by Feynman, the integral is over paths. 11metrizable inﬁnite dimensional topological manifold, for example Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES 21 The base of (1.35) is a classifying space of GLnR, and (1.35) is the vector bundle associated to the standard linear action of GLnR on Rn.A classifying map for the tangent bundle is a pullback diagram (1.36) TX \u0004\u0004 \u0005\u0005 Wn \u0005\u0005 X \u0004\u0004 BGLn R of vector bundles. Classifying maps form a contractible space, and so without changing the equivalence class of the bordism category we can assume that every manifold comes equipped with a classifying map of its tangent bundle. Suppose we have a homomorphism (1.37) ρn : Hn Ñ GLn R of Lie groups. Then a ﬂabby Hn-structure on X is a lift of its classifying map (1.36) in the diagram (1.38) pBρnq˚Wn \u0005\u0005 \u0006\u0006\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 TX \u0004\u0004 \u0007\u0007\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 \u0005\u0005 Wn \u0005\u0005 BHn Bρn\b\b\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 X \u0004\u0004 \u0007\u0007\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 BGLn R Exercise 1.39. Express orientations and spin structures in this language. Rec- oncile this ﬂabby deﬁnition with any other that you know. In the end, then, we only need the space Xn “ BHn and a rank n real vector bundle over it, or equivalently a continuous map πn : Xn Ñ BGLn R.Let BGL “ colim nÑ8 B GLn R. Definition 1.40. An n-dimensional ﬂabby tangential structure is a topological space Xn and a ﬁbration πn : Xn Ñ B GLn R.A stable ﬂabby tangential structure is a topological space X and a ﬁbration π : X Ñ BGL. It gives rise to an n-dimensional ﬂabby tangential structure for each n P Zě0 by deﬁning πn : Xn Ñ BGLn R as the ﬁber product (1.41) Xn πn \u0005\u0005\u0006\u0006\u0006 \u0004\u0004\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 X π \u0005\u0005 BGLn R \u0004\u0004 BGL If M is a k-dimensional manifold, k ď n,then a ﬂabby Xn-structure on M is a lift12 M Ñ Xn of a classifying map M Ñ BGLn R of the rank n stabilized tangent bundle13 Rn´k ‘ TM Ñ M .A ﬂabby X-structure on M is a family of coherent ﬂabby Xn-structures for n suﬃciently large. The terminology is inconsistent for Xn “ BHn, but hopefully that does not cause confusion: we use ‘Hn-structure’ in place of ‘BHn-structure’. 12The lift includes an isomorphism of rank n bundles, as in (1.36) and (1.38). 13Let S, F be spaces. Then F Ñ S is the constant ﬁber bundle with ﬁber F over S. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 22 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES Example 1.42 (Framings). A framing of a vector bundle is an isomorphism with a trivial bundle, that is, a bundle with constant ﬁbers. If the bundle has rank n, then we might call this an ‘n-framing’. This corresponds to the n-dimensional ﬂabby tangential structure πn : EGLn R Ñ BGLn R which is a universal principal GLn R- bundle. Stable framings correspond to the stable universal bundle π : EGL Ñ BGL. Example 1.43. Let S be a topological space and set Xn “ BGLn R ˆ S with πn : Xn Ñ BGLn R projection. Then an Xn-structure on M is a continuous map M Ñ S. Fix an n-dimensional ﬂabby tangential structure πn : Xn Ñ BGLn R.There is a bordism category Bordxn´1,nypXnq of Xn-manifolds; in case Xn “ BHn we use the notation ‘Bordxn´1,nypHnq’. We can replace the domain in (1.18) with Bordxn´1,nypXnq to deﬁne an n-dimensional topological ﬁeld theory of Xn-manifolds. Here are a few examples. Example 1.44 (Dijkgraaf-Witten [DW]). This is a variation of Example 1.23 deﬁned on oriented manifolds, so a functor Bordxn´1,nypGL` n RqÑ VectC,where GL` n R Ă GLn R is the index two subgroup of orientation-preserving automorphisms of R n. Fix a space of homotopy type BG and a singular cocycle λ P C npBG; R{Zq. The isomorphism class of the theory we construct depends only on the cohomol- ogy class ¯λ P H npBG; R{Zq.If X is a closed oriented n-manifold and P Ñ X aprincipal G-bundle, then the characteristic class ¯λ determines a cohomology class ¯λpP qP H npX; R{Zq and so a nonzero complex number expp2πi x¯λpP q, rXsyq, where rXsP HnpXq is the fundamental class of the orientation. A more elaborate construction [FQ, Appendix B] produces for each closed oriented pn´1q-manifold Y a complex line bundle LG,λpY qÑ BunGpY q and for each bordism X : Y0 Ñ Y1 an isomorphism (1.45) αG,λpXq : s˚LG,λpY0qÝÑ t ˚LG,λpY1q in the correspondence diagram (1.24). Deﬁne the twisted gauge theory (1.46) GG,λ :Bordxn´1,nypGL` n RqÝÑ VectC by replacing (1.26) with the space of sections of LG,λpY qÑ BunGpY q and (1.27) with the composition (1.47) GG,λpXq“ t˚ ˝ αG,λpXq˝ s˚. Remark 1.48. Continuing Remark 1.30 we observe that if X : ∅ n´1 Ñ ∅ n´1 is a closed oriented n-manifold, then (1.49) αG,λpXq“ e2πi x¯λp´q,rXsy is multiplication by the exponentiated characteristic number of a principal G-bundle P Ñ X. This is called the exponentiated (classical) action in a physical context. Then t˚ is again the Feynman path integral, but now with the usual integrand of the exponentiated action (1.49). Example 1.50 (Classical Dijkgraaf-Witten). The Dijkgraaf-Witten theory in Example 1.44 uses the principal G-bundle as a ﬂuctuating ﬁeld. Before summing over it we obtain another topological ﬁeld theory in which the principal G-bundle is Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES 23 a background ﬁeld, so part of the (ﬂabby) tangential structure. Set Xn “ BGL` n Rˆ BG with the obvious map to BGLn R. Then deﬁne14 (1.51) αG,λ :Bordxn´1,nypXnqÝÑ VectC on closed pn ´ 1q-manifolds using LG,λ and on n-dimensional bordisms using (1.45); see [FQ] for details. In physics terminology αG,λ is the classical 15 ﬁeld theory whose quantization is the Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. It is an invertible 16 theory in the sense that it factors through the maximal Picard subgroupoid LineC Ă VectC of complex lines (1-dimensional vector spaces) and invertible linear maps. We will say much more about invertible theories in Lecture 6. Example 1.52 (Characteristic numbers). Any characteristic number deter- mines a topological ﬁeld theory [F2]. These theories often require an orientation. 17 The characteristic number can be computed by cutting an n-manifold along codi- mension one submanifolds. (There is a stronger locality which allows cutting along higher codimension submanifolds; see Lecture 6.) The simplest example comes from the Euler number. Fix a dimension n and a nonzero complex number μ P Cˆ. Then deﬁne (1.53) ϵμ :Bordxn´1,ny ÝÑ VectC by ϵμpY q“ C for every object Y in Bordxn´1,ny,and ϵμpXq“ μEulerpXq for every morphism X, where EulerpXqP Z is the Euler number of the compact topological space underlying the bordism X. 1.4. Varying the codomain: super vector spaces We introduce the symmetric monoidal category of supervectorspaces.For more detail on superalgebra see [DeM]. The word ‘super’ is a synonym for ‘Z{2Z- graded’. A supervectorspace is a pair pV, ϵq consisting of a vector space (over a ﬁeld k of characteristic not equal18 to 2) and an endomorphism ϵ : V Ñ V such that ϵ 2 “ idV .The ˘-eigenspaces of ϵ provide a decomposition V “ V 0 ‘ V 1; elements of the subspace V 0 are called even and elements of the subspace V 1 are called odd. A morphism pV, ϵqÑpV 1,ϵ 1q is a linear map T : V Ñ V 1 such that T ˝ ϵ “ ϵ 1 ˝ T . It follows that T maps even elements to even elements and odd elements to odd elements. The monoidal structure is deﬁned as (1.54) pV1,ϵ1qbpV2,ϵ2q“pV1 b V2,ϵ1 b ϵ2q If v P V is a homogeneous element, deﬁne its parity |v|P t0, 1u so that v P V |v|. Then for homogeneous elements vi P Vi the symmetry is (1.55) σ : pV1,ϵ1qbpV2,ϵ2qÝÑpV2,ϵ2qbpV1,ϵ1q v1 b v2 ÞÝÑ p´1q|v1||v2| v2 b v1 This is called the Koszul sign rule.Let sVectk denote the symmetric monoidal category of super vector spaces. The obvious forgetful functor sVectk Ñ Vectk 14The domain of (1.51) can also be notated ‘Bordxn´1,nypGL ` n R ˆ Gq’. 15Axiom System 1.17 does not distinguish between classical and quantum. 16invertible in the symmetric monoidal category (1.33) 17For characteristic numbers in generalized cohomology theories, such as K-theory, an ap- propriate generalized orientation, such as a spinc structure, is required. 18There is a diﬀerent description in characteristic 2.

BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES is not a symmetric monoidal functor, though it is a monoidal functor. Diligent application of (1.55) leads to a plethora of signs yet avoids sign problems. Remark 1.56. In quantum mechanics we use super vector spaces over C to model quantum systems with bosonic and fermionic states. In that context the parity of a homogeneous element encodes the statistics of the corresponding quan- tum state. Example 1.57. There is an invertible 1-dimensional theory α of unoriented manifolds which assigns the odd line Π to a point. (Π is the vector space C with odd grading.) You can check that αpS1q“´1. Write (1.58) α :Bordx0,1y ÝÑ sLineC, where sLineC Ă sVectC is the underlying groupoid whose objects are super lines and whose morphisms are even isomorphisms, i.e., degree-preserving isomorphisms. Example 1.59 (Arf theory [MS, Gu, DeGu]). This is an invertible 2-dimen- sional theory of spin manifolds: (1.60) α :Bordx1,2ypSpin2qÝÑ sLineC . The partition function of a closed spin 2-manifold is (1.61) αpXq“ p´1qArfpXq, where ArfpXqP Z{2Z is the Arf invariant of the quadratic form qX : H1pXqÑ Z{2Z determined by the spin structure [KT1]: if S Ă X is an embedded circle representing a homology class, then the value of qX on that class is 0 or 1 according as the induced spin structure on S bounds or not. Remark 1.62. There is an important qualitative distinction between the the- ories in Example 1.57 and Example 1.59: the latter is unitary whereas the former is not. We discuss unitarity for Axiom System 1.17 in Lecture 7. Exercise 1.63. Complete the deﬁnition of the Arf theory α. You should ﬁnd that for S a circle with spin structure, αpSq is one-dimensional and is even or odd according as S bounds or not. 1.5. Bordism and homotopy theory Y0 Y1 [0,1] × M Figure 1.6. Aframedbordism in M The relationship between bordism and homotopy theory was originally de- veloped by Pontrjagin [P]for framed bordism; subsequently, it was extended by Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES 25 Thom [T]. Here we review the basic Pontrjagin-Thom construction. Fix a closed m-dimensional manifold M .Let Y Ă M be a submanifold and ν Ñ Y the normal bundle, which is the quotient of the restriction of TM to Y by TY .A framing of the submanifold Y Ă M is a trivialization of the normal bundle ν Ñ Y . Fix a pos- itive integer q ă m. Framed submanifolds of M of codimension q arise as follows. Let f : M Ñ Sq be a smooth map. Suppose p P Sq is a regular value of f .Then Y :“ f ´1ppqĂ M is a submanifold and the diﬀerential f˚ at y maps the subspace TyY Ă TyM to zero, so f˚ factors down to a map νy Ñ TpSq.The fact that p is a regular value implies that the latter is an isomorphism, and this deﬁnes a framing of ν Ñ Y . Of course, regular values are not unique. In fact, Sard’s theorem asserts that they form an open dense subset of Sq. The inverse images Y0 :“ f ´1pp0q and Y1 “ f ´1pp1q of two regular values p0,p1 P Sq are framed bordant in M .(See Figure 1.6.) Framed bordism in M is an equivalence relation; the set of equivalence classes is denoted ‘Ωfr m´q;M ’. This Pontrjagin construction of a normally framed manifold as the inverse image of a regular value deﬁnes a map (1.64) rM, SqsÝÑ Ωfr m´q;M from homotopy classes of maps M Ñ Sq to normally framed submanifolds of M . Theorem 1.65 (Pontrjagin-Thom). The map (1.64) is an isomorphism. r 1 ρ Figure 1.7. Cutoﬀ function for collapse map There is a geometrically deﬁned inverse map to (1.64), known as the Pontrjagin- Thom collapse.Let Y Ă M be a framed submanifold of codimension q, so equipped with an isomorphism ν – Rq. Recall that any submanifold Y has a tubular neigh- borhood, which is an open neighborhood U Ă M of Y , a submersion U Ñ Y ,and an isomorphism ϕ : ν Ñ U which makes the diagram (1.66) ν ϕ \u0004\u0004 \t\t\b\b\b\b\b\b\b U \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Y commute. The framing of ν then leads to a map h : U Ñ R q. The collapse map fY : M Ñ Sq is (1.67) fY pxq“ $ & % hpxq ρ`|hpxq| ˘ ,x P U ; 8,x P M zU. Here we write Sq “ Rq Yt8u and we ﬁx a cutoﬀ function ρ as depicted in Figure 1.7. We represent a collapse map in Figure 1.8. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 26 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES fY S q p ∞ Y M Figure 1.8. Pontrjagin-Thom collapse There are choices (regular value, tubular neighborhood, cutoﬀ function) in these constructions, but the map (1.64) and its inverse are independent of these choices. See [Mi1, F1] for a proof of Theorem 1.65. Now specialize to the case M “ Sm is a sphere. Introduce basepoints and pass to pointed maps and pointed homotopy equivalences; the reader can check that the sets of homotopy classes of maps is unchanged in (1.68) when basepoints are accounted for. Suspension Σ of pointed topological spaces takes spheres to spheres—there is a homeomorphism ΣSm – Sm`1. Hence suspension induces a sequence of maps (1.68) rSm,Sqs Σ ÝÝÑrSm`1,Sq`1s Σ ÝÝÑrSm`2,Sq`2s Σ ÝÝÑ ¨¨¨ This is a sequence (1.69) πmSq Σ ÝÝÑ πm`1Sq`1 Σ ÝÝÑ πm`2Sq`2 Σ ÝÝÑ ¨¨¨ of homomorphisms of abelian groups, homotopy groups of the sphere. We state the following without proof, though we indicate one route to a proof below. Theorem 1.70 (Freudenthal [Fr]). The sequence (1.68) stabilizes in the sense that all but ﬁnitely many maps are isomorphisms. Set n “ m´q. The limiting group is the nth stable homotopy group of the sphere,or nth stable stem, and is denoted πnS0. The structure of the stable stem is central in stable homotopy theory. The ﬁrst few groups are exhibited in the following table: (1.71) nπnS0 40 3 Z{24Z 2 Z{2Z 1 Z{2Z 0 Z By the Pontrjagin-Thom Theorem 1.65 we rewrite (1.69) as a sequence of maps (1.72) Ωfr n;Sm σ ÝÝÑ Ωfr n;Sm`1 σ ÝÝÑ Ωfr n;Sm`2 σ ÝÝÑ ¨¨¨ Representatives of these framed bordism groups are submanifolds of Sm.Write Sm “ Am Yt8u, and since each framed bordism class is represented by a framed submanifold Y Ă Am; we can arrange 8R Y . This is the analog of passing from unpointed maps to pointed maps in (1.68). One can prove that (1.72) stabilizes using techniques used to prove the Whitney Embedding Theorem, namely aﬃne Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES 27 projection onto lower dimensional aﬃne spaces. The Freudenthal Suspension The- orem 1.70 follows, then, as a corollary of the Pontrjagin-Thom Theorem. The stabilization maps σ in (1.72) have a geometric description. The stabi- lization sits Sm Ă Sm`1 as the equator and prepends the standard normal vector ﬁeld B{Bx1 to the framing. The normal framing induces a stable tangential framing of Y , and the homotopy class of the stable tangential framing is unchanged under the stabilization map σ in the sequence (1.72). Conversely, if Y n has a stable tan- gential framing, then by the Whitney embedding theorem we realize Y Ă Sm as a submanifold for some m, and then we can pass from the stable tangential framing to a stable framing of the normal bundle, and so to an element of Ω fr n;Sm`k for some k. This sketch proves the following. Proposition 1.73. The colimit of (1.72) is the bordism group Ωfr n of n-mani- folds with a stable tangential framing. A bordism between two stably framed manifolds Y0,Y1 is, informally, a compact pn`1q-manifold X with boundary Y0>Y1 and a stable tangential framing of X which restricts on the boundary to the given stable tangential framings of Yi.The formal deﬁnition follows Deﬁnition 1.1. Combining Theorem 1.65 and these stabilizations we deduce Corollary 1.74 (Stable Pontrjagin-Thom). There is an isomorphism (1.75) φ : πnS0 ÝÑ Ωfr n for each n P Zě0. The Pontrjagin-Thom theorem establishes a relationship between bordism groups and stable homotopy groups. It is a foundational result and we will make extensive use of several of its variations. In Lecture 6 we introduce a bordism theory of manifolds with a general stable ﬂabby tangential structure. To close this lecture we sketch the basic idea behind Thom’s extension of Theorem 1.65 in the simplest case of no tangential structure: unoriented manifolds. ν Y BGLq R S m Wq Figure 1.9. Pontrjagin-Thom collapse Let Y Ă Sm be a codimension q manifold. No framing of any sort is assumed, so we do not expect to construct Y as the inverse image of a point under a map to Sq. Rather, we classify its normal bundle ν Ñ Y by a map to the universal Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 28 1. BORDISM AND TOPOLOGICAL FIELD THEORIES bundle (1.35): (1.76) ν \u0004\u0004 \u0005\u0005 Wq \u0005\u0005 Y \u0004\u0004 BGLqR Now perform Pontrjagin-Thom collapse ﬁberwise in (1.76). The resulting pointed space is called the Thom complex, and composing with a further Pontrjagin-Thom collapse from Sm to the Pontrjagin-Thom collapse of a tubular neighborhood of Y , we obtain a map with domain Sm, as illustrated in Figure 1.9. In this construction Y appears as the transverse inverse image of the zero section of the universal bun- dle. The appropriate Pontrjagin-Thom theorem is an isomorphism of the bordism group Ωn to the pn`qqth homotopy group of a Thom complex, at least in the stable limit q Ñ8.

We begin with a description of an axiomatic framework for mechanics, both classical and quantum. We do not attempt a detailed development here, but include it to provide a mathematical lens for understanding examples. In the case of quantum mechanics these are often called the Dirac-von Neumann axioms [D,vN1]; the subsequent mathematical development was carried out by many mathematicians, including H. Weyl, I. Segal, and G. Mackey. We give a version of these axioms in §2.1. There is a substantial body of work on passing from classical systems to quantum—quantization—but we do not say anything about that here. (We encountered it in Lecture 1 in the discussion of ﬁnite gauge theory; see Remark 1.30.) A diﬀerent set of axioms for quantum mechanics is discussed in [Ka2]. In §2.2 and §2.3 we give examples of quantum mechanical systems. The ﬁrst is a continuous and the second discrete. The discrete system is called a lattice system and is the type of quantum mechanical system one often studies in condensed matter physics. In §2.4 we take up deformation classes of quantum systems, or phases. The problem which motivates these lectures is a class of classiﬁcation problems for phases of quantum systems [FH1]. We return to it in Lecture 9. The important consequence of positivity of energy—Wick rotation—is the subject of §2.5. Finally, in §2.6 we indicate how Wick-rotated quantum mechanics ﬁts with Axiom System 1.17 in the 1-dimensional case. The higher dimensional case, in the physical setting, is taken up in Lecture 3. 2.1. An axiomatic view of Hamiltonian mechanics A convex space is a subset S of an aﬃne space (over a topological vector space) with the property that if σ0,...,σk P S and x0,... ,xk P Rą0 satisfy x0`¨¨¨`xk “ 1, then x0σ0 ` ¨¨¨ ` xkσk P S. A point σ P S is extreme if σ “ xσ1 `p1 ´ xqσ2 for 0 ď x ď 1and σ1,σ2 P S implies σ “ σ1 or σ “ σ2.A probability measure on R is a positive measure of total measure 1 on the σ-algebra of Borel sets. The set of probability measures is denoted ProbpRq.If μ P ProbpRq,then its expected value isş R λdμpλq.Let BorelpRq denote the space of real-valued Borel functions on R. Axiom System 2.1 (Mechanics). A mechanical system consists of the following data: (1) A convex space S whose elements are called states. Extreme points are called pure states and comprise a subset denoted S0. Elements of SzS0 are often called mixed states. 29 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 30 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS (2) A complex topological vector space O with a real structure whose real elements OR are called observables. A dense subspace O8 Ă O has the structure of a complex Lie algebra. 19 (3) A choice of observable H P O8 R . (4) A pairing p : OR ˆ S Ñ ProbpRq; elements A P OR and σ P S pair to σA. (5) A map BorelpRqˆ OR Ñ OR; elements f P BorelpRq and A P OR pair to f pAq. (6) A map from O8 R to one-parameter groups of automorphisms of S and of O. The data satisfy several axioms, some of which we list here. The pairing p sepa- rates states and observables: the induced maps O Ñ Map `S, ProbpRq˘ and S Ñ Map `O, ProbpRq˘ are injective. For f P BorelpRq, A, A1,A2 P O, σ, σi P S,and positive real numbers xi summing to 1 we require (2.2) pxiσiqA “ xipσiqA σA1`A2 “ σA1 ˚ σA2 σf pAq “ f˚σA, where ‘˚’ is the convolution product of measures and in the last equation we use the pushforward measure. The one-parameter groups Aptq, σptq of automorphisms generated by H P O8 R satisfy dAptq dt “´rH, Aptqs,A P O8,t P R,(2.3) σptq Aptq “ σA,σ P S,A P OR,t P R.(2.4) This is not a complete list of axioms, nor a deﬁnitive list, but it is representative of the structure. (For example, we have not commented on the topologies on states and observables.) A brief summary of the axioms appears at the beginning of [Fa1] and a more elaborate account is in [Ma, §2-2]. Other mathematical axiom systems for quantum mechanics may be found in [Str, §1.3] and [Ta, §2]. We make several remarks. ‚ There are dual points of view on the time evolution generated by an observable H.In the Schr¨odinger picture the states evolve σ ÞÑ σptq,and in the Heisenberg picture the observables evolve A ÞÑ Aptq. Equation (2.4) expresses the compatibility of these pictures. ‚ The probability measure σA models measurement of an observable A in a state σ.The expectation value (2.5) xAyσ “ ż R λdσA deﬁnes a real-valued pairing of observables and states, and it is also as- sumed to separate states and observables. ‚ The special observable H P O8 R is called the Hamiltonian,or energy oper- ator. Our sign convention [DF2]isthat ´H generates time translation. ‚ No associative algebra structure is assumed on observables, only a Lie algebra structure. 19For A1,A2 P O8 the real structure A ÞÑ A˚ satisﬁes rA1,A2s˚ “rA˚ 1 ,A˚ 2 s. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS 31 ‚ Often a state σ P S is ﬁxed as part of the data. It may be assumed invariant under the time-evolution σptq “ σ in which case it is called a vacuum state. Now we bring in time more explicitly and rework the axioms. Time is modeled as the standard Euclidean line M1; the notation anticipates Minkowski spacetime, which we introduce in Lecture 3. The inner product on the underlying group R of time translations models a clock: we can measure diﬀerences of time. No time orientation is assumed. The symmetry group of M1 is the Euclidean group of trans- lations and reﬂections, the latter in this context called time-reversing symmetries. Not every mechanical system is time-reversal invariant. Conceptually, it is useful to spread the observables over time as a complex vector bundle (2.6) O ÝÑ M1 with real structure and a dense subbundle O8 Ñ M1 with Lie algebra structure; this replaces Axiom (2). There is a trivialization so as to recover a single space of observables. Time evolution of observables in Axiom (6) is a lift of the translation action of R on M1 to (2.6). The pairing p in Axiom (4) is replaced by the correlation functions.Let t1 ă ¨¨¨ ă tℓ be a ﬁnite sequence of times in M1 and Ati P Oti observables at those times. Fix a state σ P S. Then the correlation function in the state σ is denoted (2.7) xAtℓ ¨¨¨ At1yσ P C. Physical quantities of interest can usually be extracted from correlation functions. Remark 2.8. We do not expect (2.7) to be deﬁned in the generality stated here: for example, in quantum mechanics we would have to multiply unbounded operators. For a single real observable we expect to recover the pairing p of Ax- iom (4); see [Str, §2.4] for the case of quantum mechanics using the C ˚-algebra perspective. In the next two (meta) examples we illustrate how both classical and quantum mechanics ﬁt into Axiom System 2.1. Example 2.9 (Classical mechanics). The data which deﬁnes a classical me- chanical system is a symplectic manifold pN ,ωq called the phase space,and a smooth function H : N Ñ R, the Hamiltonian. For a particle moving on a smooth manifold M (see §2.2) the phase space is TM , the space of positions and velocities of the particle. The space of states S “ ProbpN q is then the set of probability measures on N . The subspace of pure states are the point measures, which can be identiﬁed with S0 “ N . The mixed states—probability measures not supported on a point—are the states of classical statistical mechanics. The complex vector space of Borel functions O “ BorelCpN q on the phase space has real points the usual observables. The dense subspace O8 “ C 8pN q of smooth functions carries the usual Poisson bracket of symplectic geometry, which makes O8 intoacomplex Lie algebra. If A : N Ñ R is a real Borel function and σ P ProbpN q a probability measure, then the pushforward measure σA “ A˚σ on R tells the probability distri- bution of measurements of A in the state σ.If σ P O0 is a point measure supported at m P N —a non-probabilistic state of the system—then σA is a point measure Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 32 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS supported at Apmq and the observable A has a deﬁnite value. Functions of observ- ables in Axiom (5) are formed by composition. The smooth function H : N Ñ R has a symplectic gradient vector ﬁeld ξH which generates 20 aﬂow ϕt : N Ñ N . This induces a 1-parameter group of automorphisms of probability measures (S) and Borel functions (O) by pushforward and pullback, respectively. To bring time into the picture we deﬁne N 1 as the manifold of trajectories M1 Ñ N of ξH . At each time t P M1 we obtain a diﬀeomorphism N 1 Ñ N by evaluation of a trajectory at time t. Let the space of states be S “ ProbpN 1q. Deﬁne the vector space of observables Ot at t to consist of Borel functions on N 1 which depend only on the germ of a trajectory at t. Use the Hamiltonian equation of motion—that trajectories are integral curves of ξH—to see that we need only consider functions of the value (0-jet) of the trajectory at t. To deﬁne the correlation function (2.7), set A “ Atℓ ¨¨¨ At1 : N 1 Ñ R to be the product function, and compute the expectation value (2.5) of the pushforward measure A˚σ P ProbpRq. Note that the correlation function multiplies observables, and it is in this form that an algebra structure on observables appears in Axiom System 2.1. We say more about algebra structures in §5.5. Remark 2.10. There is a composition law on classical mechanical systems which combines them without interaction. Let pNi,Hiq, i “ 1, 2, be two symplectic manifolds with chosen Hamiltonian functions. The composite system has symplectic manifold N “ N1ˆN2 and Hamiltonian function π˚ 1 H1 ` π˚ 2 H2,where πi : N Ñ Ni is projection. Example 2.11 (Quantum mechanics). The data which deﬁnes a quantum me- chanical system is a complex separable Hilbert space H and a self-adjoint opera- tor H. 21 The Hilbert space H can be ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite dimensional. The space of states S is the convex set of trace class nonnegative self-adjoint opera- tors σ : H Ñ H with Trpσq“ 1. A pure state is an orthogonal projection operator onto a 1-dimensional subspace ℓ Ă H;the space S0 “ PH of pure states may be identiﬁed with the projective space of H. The observables in O are (densely deﬁned) operators on H, the real structure is A ÞÑ A˚,and the real points are self-adjoint operators.22 We allow unbounded operators and do not delve into the pursuant technicalities here. The spectral theorem associates a projection-valued measure πA on R to a self-adjoint operator A on H. Given a state σ the probability measure on R associated to A is the measure E ÞÑ Tr`πApEq˝ σ˘,where E Ă R is a Borel subset. For a Borel function f the spectral theorem also gives a deﬁnition of f pAq. The self-adjoint operator H generates a 1-parameter group of unitary automorphisms (2.12) t ÞÝÑ Ut “ expp´itH{ℏq of H. (We include Planck’s constant ℏ so that the exponent is dimensionless, since H has units of energy.) The 1-parameter group (2.12) induces motions on states 20In general, there is only a local ﬂow: we should restrict to functions which generate global ﬂows. 21In fact, we should take H to be Z{2Z-graded (§1.4): lines in the even subspace are pure bosonic states and lines in the subspace of odd elements are pure fermionic states. For simplicity we omit the Z{2Z grading here. 22It is mathematically more natural to use skew-adjoint operators [DF2], but for this expo- sition we don’t bother.

The Poisson bracket on (bracket-able) observables is the normalized operator commutator (2.13) rA1,A2s“ ´i ℏ pA1 ˝ A2 ´ A2 ˝ A1q. Remark 2.14. There is a composition law on quantum mechanical systems which combines them without interaction. Let `Hi, pUiqt˘, i “ 1, 2, be two quantum mechanical systems. The composite system has Hilbert space H “ H1 b H2 and unitary time evolution pU1qt bpU2qt. Remark 2.15. There is a basic dichotomy for quantum mechanical systems: gapped vs. gapless. In a gapped system the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is bounded below, the minimum is contained in the point spectrum, and there is a spectral gap above this lowest eigenvalue. If these conditions do not hold, the system is termed gapless. The low energy behavior of gapped systems is quite diﬀerent from that of gapless ones. Remark 2.16. Let M , L,and T denote mass, length, and time. Then Planck’s constant ℏ and the speed of light c have dimensions (2.17) rℏs“ ML2 T , rcs“ L T . In a quantum mechanical system ℏ identiﬁes energy pML2{T 2q with inverse time. So low energy is equivalent to long time. In a relativistic system c identiﬁes length and time, so long time is long distance. We use the term ‘long range’ for either (and for both in a relativistic system). In a relativistic quantum system both ℏ and c are in play, and we use ℏ{c to identify mass with inverse length, so too inverse time, so too energy. 2.2. Example: particle on a manifold Fix a Riemannian manifold pM, gq of dimension d. The mechanical system we consider models a particle moving on the manifold M , but variations of interpreta- tion are possible. For example, if M “pE3qˆN is the Cartesian product of N copies of Euclidean space, then we use it to model N particles moving in space. There is a dichotomy in the behavior of the model depending if M is compact or not, but the formal setup is the same. Assume that the Riemannian manifold M is complete. Axiom System 2.1 captures the Hamiltonian view of mechanics. For many physical systems there is a more powerful Lagrangian formulation from which the Hamiltonian data can be derived. We will not elaborate on that in these lectures, but remark that Example 1.23 and Example 1.44 are instances of the passage from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian in quantum theory using the Feynman path integral. For a detailed development of this passage in classical ﬁeld theory, see [DF1]. The main object, the Lagrangian density, for a particle on M is 1{2 |dφ|2 |dt|,where φ : R Ñ M is a function which describes the trajectory of a particle as a function of (aﬃne) time. The Euler-Lagrange equations are then used to derive the moduli space N 1 of classical trajectories as a symplectic manifold and also a Hamiltonian function H : N 1 Ñ R. Recall from Example 2.9 that from these two pieces of data we can deﬁne states and observables, their pairing to probability distributions, etc. For the particle on M (with zero potential energy function) we ﬁnd N 1 is the space Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 34 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS of geodesic motions on M .If we ﬁx a time t0 P R, then evaluation of the position and velocity of a geodesic φ : R Ñ M at t0 is a diﬀeomorphism N 1 – TM . Under that diﬀeomorphism the symplectic structure becomes the pullback of the canonical symplectic form on T ˚M under the isomorphism TM Ñ T ˚M determined by the Riemannian metric. The Hamiltonian function Hpξq“ 1{2 |ξ| 2 generates the geodesic ﬂow on TM . The passage from the Lagrangian formulation to the quantum mechanical sys- tem (Example 2.11) is achieved via canonical, or geometric, quantization and the Feynman path integral. In this case we integrate over the inﬁnite dimensional space of paths φ. Since it is integrated out the (ﬂuctuating) ﬁeld φ does not appear in the description. When we come to ﬁeld theory this procedure does not have well- deﬁned mathematical underpinnings in the generality needed, but for paths there is a rigorous theory of Wiener measure, or stochastic integration [Ku]. For the par- ticle on M it is straightforward, at least heuristically, to derive the Hilbert space H and self-adjoint Hamiltonian operator H.Namely, H “ L 2pM, μgq is the space of complex L 2 functions with respect to the Riemannian measure, and H “ 1{2Δg is the (unbounded) Hodge Laplace operator. The dichotomy we ﬂagged in the ﬁrst paragraph of this section can be made more concrete. If M is compact, then H has discrete spectrum. In particular, the minimum eigenvalue is 0 and there is a gap in the spectrum between 0 and the ﬁrst nonzero eigenvalue. By contrast, if M is not compact then there can be continuous spectrum and perhaps no spectral gap. Again the spectrum is bounded below by 0, but if M has inﬁnite volume then 0 is not an eigenvalue but rather is part of the continuous spectrum. For example, if M “ Ed is Euclidean space then the spectrum of the (classical) Laplacian is continuous and is the subset Rě0 of R. Exercise 2.18. Let V : M Ñ R be a potential energy function. Work out the modiﬁcation to both the classical and quantum models including the function V . How does the model behave in case M “ E1 and the function V is quadratic? How does the sign of the quadratic term aﬀect your answer? Exercise 2.19. Let M be thecircleof length L ą 0, which we can write as R{LZ.Set V “ 0. (1) Work out the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian: eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. (2) The orthogonal group O2 acts by isometries on M so induces an action on the quantum mechanical system. How does that action appear relative to the spectral decomposition in (1)? 2.3. Example: a lattice system (toric code) One often approximates a ﬁeld theory by a lattice model. Conversely, lattice models are often the starting point in condensed matter physics, and there are ﬁeld theory approximations. ‘Lattice’ refers to a combinatorial approximation to a manifold. Intuitively, the combinatorial structure replaces a Riemannian metric, which is a typical geometric structure on space in other quantum systems. Many models are local, so can be formulated on arbitrary d-manifolds for some positive integer d, the dimension of space. On a compact manifold the Hilbert space of states is usually ﬁnite dimensional. We do not attempt a mathematically precise formulation of lattice models in general, nor of their approximation at low energies Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS 35 by a ﬁeld theory, but here give a geometric example in which the low energy ﬁeld theory limit can easily be deduced. This particular model, called the toric code,is due to Kitaev [Ki1]. Lattice gauge theories were ﬁrst introduced by Wegner [We]. For a twisted version of the toric code, see [FHa, Deb]. Let Y be a closed d-manifold with ﬁnite CW structure, for example from a Morse function. Let Y i denote the i-skeleton and Δ i the ﬁnite set of i-cells. Recall from Example 1.23 that BunGpY q is the groupoid of principal G-bundles on Y .Let BunGpY 1,Y 0q denote the groupoid of pairs pP, sq consisting of a principal G-bundle P Ñ Y 1 over the 1-skeleton together with a trivialization s of its restriction to the 0-skeleton. This groupoid is (equivalent to) a discrete groupoid; parallel transport along (oriented) 1-cells deﬁnes an equivalence (2.20) BunGpY 1,Y 0q« MappΔ 1,Gq« ą ePΔ1 G to the indicated set. Deﬁne the Hilbert space (2.21) H “ Map `BunGpY 1,Y 0q, C˘ – â ePΔ1 MappG, Cq of functions on this discrete groupoid. For the toric code we specialize to G “ Z{2Z. The Hamiltonian is a sum of local commuting operators, one for each vertex and one for each 2-cell. For v P Δ 0 deﬁne a permutation ϕv of (2.20) by pP, sq ÞÑpP, svq, where (2.22) svpv1q“ # spv1q,v1 ­“ v; spvq` 1,v1 “ v, and for ψ P H set (2.23) Hvψ “ 1 2 pψ ´ ϕ˚ v ψq. The eigenvalues of Hv are 0 and 1; the eigenspaces the functions invariant/anti- invariant under changing the trivialization at v.For f P Δ 2 let (2.24) pHf ψqpP, sq“ holBf pP q¨ ψpP, sq be multiplication by the holonomy hol Pt0, 1u around the boundary of f . Again the eigenvalues are 0 and 1; the kernel consists of bundles with trivial holonomy around Bf . The operators Hv and Hf commute. Deﬁne the Hamiltonian (2.25) H “ ÿ vPΔ0 Hv ` ÿ f PΔ2 Hf . Then H ě 0 and the kernel of H is isomorphic to (2.26) H0 “ Map `BunZ{2ZpY q, C˘ the space of functions on the stack of Z{2Z-bundles on Y . Note that this is precisely the state space GGpY q of the pd ` 1q-dimensional Z{2Z-gauge theory; see (1.26). Remark 2.27. This is an example in which we see very explicitly that the low energy sector is modeled as a topological ﬁeld theory, at least as far as state spaces go. This model is gapped in the sense that there is a spectral gap above the minimum eigenvalue which is uniform over all CW structures. Here the spectrum is contained in Zě0, so the gap is manifest. For other examples worked out in detail, see [DeGu, Deb]. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 36 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS 2.4. Families of quantum systems To deﬁne a good moduli space 23 M in geometry we usually need to (i) ﬁx discrete data, and (ii) remove a locus Δ of “singular” objects. The set π0M of path components of the moduli space is, by deﬁnition, the set of deformation classes of geometric objects under study. A deformation class consists of qualitatively similar objects. A general problem is to determine invariants which separate points of π0M. Example 2.28 (Symmetric bilinear forms). Fix a vector space V of dimen- sion 2. Then Sym 2 V ˚ is the 3-dimensional vector space of symmetric bilinear forms on V . Let Δ denote the locus of degenerate forms, a quadratic cone in Sym 2 V ˚,and let M “ Sym 2 V ˚zΔ be the space of nondegenerate forms. There are 3 components and the signature (2.29) Sign : π0M ÝÑ t´2, 0, 2u is a complete invariant. Sign = 2 Sign = −2 Sign = 0 Δ Figure 2.1. Nondegenerate symmetric bilinear forms in dimension 2 Exercise 2.30. The proper moduli space here is the set of equivalence classes of pairs pV, Bq of a 2-dimensional vector space and a symmetric bilinear form, with degenerate forms removed. What is the picture? Example 2.31 (Complex surfaces). Moduli spaces are prevalent in algebraic geometry: moduli spaces of curves, moduli spaces of abelian varieties, moduli spaces of vector bundles, etc. As a concrete example, consider complex surfaces of general type. There are two numerical invariants to ﬁx: the Euler number and the signa- ture. Then there is a moduli space of surfaces of general type with ﬁxed numerical invariants [Ca]. It has ﬁnitely many components, so there are ﬁnitely many defor- mation types. Deformation equivalent surfaces are diﬀeomorphic, but the converse is false. We consider continuous families of quantum mechanical systems parametrized by a space. Care is needed with the topologies to arrive at the correct notion; see [FM1, Appendix D]. We can formulate a moduli problem by ﬁxing discrete parameters, and indeed one of the main problems we address in these lectures is of that type. 24 For now the following picture is a cartoon, not rigorous mathematics. 23More precisely, moduli stack 24The problem lies in ﬁeld theory, and we use a rigorous framework in which to address it. The application to lattice systems proceeds via heuristic leaps of faith. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS 37 Let X be the moduli space (really stack) of quantum theories with ﬁxed discrete parameters, and Δ Ă X the locus of phase transitions. A phase transition has an order, a positive integer, and they divide according as the order “ 1orthe order ą 1. At an order 1 phase transition the quantum system is still gapped, but some part of the discrete spectrum of nearby systems comes down to the minimum, so there is a discontinuity in the dimension of the vacuum space (eigenspace for the minimal eigenvalue). By contrast, at a phase transition of order ą 1a part of the continuous spectrum has come down to zero. The complement of Δ may contain gapless systems, which for our purposes we throw out. Then path components of pXzΔqgapped are called (gapped or topological) phases. Figure 2.2. Phase diagram of water Example 2.32. The typical example is the phase diagram of H2O. There the parameters are Temperature and Pressure; see Figure 2.2. The solid black line is the locus Δ of phase transitions. They are all ﬁrst order except for the critical point C. At room pressure, labeled ‘101’ in the ﬁgure, we see the usual 3 phases of solid, liquid, and gas. But in the two dimensional family there are only two phases: there is a path connecting liquid and gas at high temperature. The classiﬁcation of topological phases of matter is a problem of current inter- est [Nob, Cas]. The discrete parameters to be ﬁxed are the dimension d of space and the (internal) symmetry group I. Then we can imagine, but not deﬁne, a moduli space M “ Mpd, Iq of gapped systems after removing the locus of phase transitions. It is a very interesting question to rigorously deﬁne lattice systems and moduli spaces of lattice systems. For now we simply imagine M exists. A point m P M represents an isomorphism class of lattice systems, and the phase of m is its component in π0M. Problem 2.33. Compute π0Mpd, Iq. We emphasize that this is not a well-deﬁned mathematical problem, so we invoke two physical principles to transform Problem 2.33 into a well-deﬁned math- ematical problem: Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 38 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS (1) the deformation class of a quantum system is determined by its low energy behavior; (2) the low energy physics of a gapped system is well-approximated by a topo- logical 25 ﬁeld theory. See [G] for some discussion of these physical principles. In Lecture 8 we prove classiﬁcation theorems for certain ﬁeld theories and apply them to Problem 2.33 using these principles. In other words, we model the question of classiﬁcation of phases as a classiﬁcation problem in ﬁeld theory. Our attack on that problem is enabled by the existence of an Axiom System for ﬁeld theory, which we discuss in Lecture 3. Remark 2.34. Let M 1pd, Iq be the moduli space of eﬀective ﬁeld theories with the given discrete parameters. The physical principles suggest that once Mpd, Iq is deﬁned there is a map (2.35) π0Mpd, IqÝÑ π0M 1pd, Iq. We do not expect a map Mpd, IqÑ M 1pd, Iq; there may be choices in writing a low energy approximation. But we can imagine that those choices 26 do not aﬀect the deformation class of the eﬀective ﬁeld theory, so expect that the homotopy class of (2.35) is well-deﬁned. Then (2) implies that the map (2.35) is injective. We will see in Lecture 10 that for our particular problem the computations we make of π0M 1 agree with the deductions of π0M in the physics literature, which provides evidence that, at least for this problem, the map (2.35) is bijective. We revisit this discussion in §9.1. Remark 2.36. In Riemannian geometry there is an illuminating analog of (1). Fix a dimension d P Zě0 and imagine a moduli space Md of compact Riemannian manifolds pM, gq of dimension d.Let Δ ppq g denote the Laplace operator on p- forms. For each p this is analogous to a family of quantum mechanical systems—a family of self-adjoint operators over Md. Further, these systems are gapped since the Laplace operator has discrete spectrum. Now the deformation classes π0Md are diﬀeomorphism types of compact d-manifolds. The zero eigenspace consists of harmonic forms, and by the Hodge and de Rham theorems it has topological signiﬁcance: its dimension is constant on components of Md and equals the pth Betti number of the underlying smooth manifold. These Betti numbers are not complete invariants of the diﬀeomorphism type, of course, but it is the only topological information in the spectrum. Remark 2.37. Consider the special case d “ 1. Observe that if we allow noncompact manifolds, then there is a smooth path of complete Riemannian 1- manifolds which connects a single circle to two circles: elongate a circle to an ellipse to two lines and then each line to a circle. Similarly, if we restrict to compact spaces but allow simple singularities as in a ﬁgure eight, then we can connect a single circle to two circles (by passing through the ﬁgure eight). If we consider the spectrum of the Laplace operator along this path, then the ﬁrst transition from one to two circles is analogous to a higher order phase transition whereas the second, through compact spaces, is analogous to a ﬁrst order phase transition. 25In fact, the low energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory may be mildly non-topological, as we explain in Lecture 9. 26for example, of local terms in an eﬀective lagrangian Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS 39 2.5. Wick rotation in quantum mechanics Let pH,Utq be a quantum mechanical system, where the unitary evolution (2.38) Ut “ e ´itH{ℏ is the one-parameter group generated by a self-adjoint operator H on H.If we assume that the energy operator H is nonnegative, then there is an “analytic con- tinuation” of the system in the sense that the real time physics appears as the boundary value of a holomorphic theory on the lower half plane of t P C with neg- ative imaginary part. This applies to both the group of time evolution as well as the correlation functions, which are functions of aﬃne time. To extend (2.38) to complex values of t,observe that if λ P Rě0 then the function t ÞÑ e ´iλt, t P R,is the boundary value of a bounded holomorphic function on (2.39) C´ “ `t P C :Im t ă 0˘; if λ ą 0 then this function takes values in the open unit disk in C. Hence if H is a nonnegative self-adjoint operator, the spectral theorem deﬁnes a holomorphic semigroup (2.40) t ÞÝÑ e ´itH{ℏ,t P C´, of bounded operators. The unitary evolution (2.38) appears on the boundary R of C´. Wick rotation is the restriction of this holomorphic semigroup to t “´iτ for positive real τ : (2.41) τ ÞÝÑ e ´τH{ℏ,τ P Rą0. This is a real semigroup of bounded self-adjoint operators. The unitary group (2.38) can be reconstructed from the real semigroup (2.41). 2.6. The Axiom System in quantum mechanics Wick-rotated quantum mechanics can be formulated as an n “ 1 version of Axiom System 1.17, but with two important modiﬁcations: ‚ the 1-dimensional bordisms have a Riemannian metric; ‚ the codomain is an appropriate category of topological vector spaces [Se2, §1.4], [C1, Appendix 2], [HST, §6.1]. There is another technical modiﬁcation: the objects are oriented 0-manifolds em- bedded in a germ of an oriented 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The Wick- rotated quantum mechanical system associated to pH,Hq assigns H to a posi- tively oriented point embedded in a symmetric germ, say the germ of p´ϵ, ϵqĂ E1 for ϵ ą 0. (If the germ is not symmetric we expect a more complicated topological vector space [Se3, Lecture 2].) To the oriented closed interval Xτ of length τ ą 0 with one incoming and one outgoing boundary we assign the operator e ´τH{ℏ.This incorporates the basic structure. Other bordisms must be included to obtain a fully deﬁned functor. Remark 2.42. The circle S1 of length τ ą 0 should map to Trpe´τH{ℏq, but that operator need not be trace class in general. For a particle moving on a man- ifold M (§2.2), it is trace class if M is compact, but it need not be if M is not compact, e.g., M “ Ed.

Two geometric 1-dimensional bordisms Remark 2.43. There are more exotic bordisms, such as the oriented inter- vals depicted in Figure 2.3. The ﬁrst, with both boundary components incoming, evaluates to the bilinear map (2.44) H ˆ H ÝÑ C ψ1,ψ2 ÞÝÑ x ¯ψ1,e ´τH{ℏψ2yH, while the second need not be deﬁned in the general (noncompact) case. t1 +− ++ t3 +− t2 +− Figure 2.4. Wick-rotated correlation function There is a notion of a “noncompact ﬁeld theory”, deﬁned on bordisms with nonempty outgoing boundary on each component, to accommodate the issues raised in Remark 2.42 and Remark 2.43. This has been deﬁned (in arbitrary dimensions— quantum mechanics is 1-dimensional in this sense) by Graeme Segal [Se4]and also by Kevin Costello in [C2]. Remark 2.45. The vector space of observables at a point x P X in an oriented Riemannian 1-manifold X is the inverse limit as ϵ Ñ 0 of the vector spaces attached to BBϵpxq, the boundary of the interval of radius ϵ ą 0about x (with its induced germ); see [Se3, Lecture 2]. The Wick rotation of the correlation function (2.7) is then computed using Figure 2.4. Example 2.46 (Parallel transport as a quantum mechanical system). We con- clude with an example of an invertible, but not topological, 1-dimensional ﬁeld theory. It can be viewed as the Wick rotation of a quantum mechanical system with a single state. Let M be an auxiliary manifold and L Ñ M a complex line bundle with covariant derivative. The oriented ﬁeld theory αk, k P Z, is deﬁned on the bordism category of oriented 0- and 1-manifolds equipped with a smooth map to M . The value on a 0-manifold does not depend on a germ. There are no Riemannian metrics. Set (2.47) αkpY, φ : Y Ñ M q“ â yPY Lbk φpyq,Y a 0-manifold, αkpX, φ : X Ñ M q“ `ρbk : Lbk φp0q ÝÑ Lbk φp1q˘,X “r0, 1s, where the bordism X : t0uÑt1u has t0u incoming and t1u outgoing; ρ is the parallel transport on γ˚L Ñr0, 1s. The value of αk on other bordisms is easily deduced. Of course, there is a variation which uses principal T-bundles in place of complex line bundles. Here T Ă C is the group of unit norm complex numbers. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 2. QUANTUM MECHANICS 41 Exercise 2.48. Find computations in the theory αk which recover the inte- ger k. (Hint: You may want to evaluate the theory on families of manifolds.27.) You may regard k as a topological invariant of this non-topological theory; more precisely, it is a deformation invariant. 27It is important that the Axiom System include evaluations in families, thought we do not emphasize that in these lectures; see [ST, §2] Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society.Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. LECTURE 3 Wick-Rotated Quantum Field Theory and Symmetry In Lecture 1 we saw how the categoriﬁcation of bordism invariants, such as the signature of a closed oriented manifold, leads to the notion of a topological ﬁeld the- ory (Axiom System 1.17). In Lecture 2 we saw how the state space and correlation functions of a quantum mechanical system, after Wick rotation, form a geometric analog of a 1-dimensional topological ﬁeld theory (§2.6). It is a simple matter to combine these in the n-dimensional case (n P Zě1) to deduce the outlines of an Axiom System for Wick-rotated quantum ﬁeld theory. This type of Axiom System was introduced in the 1980s by Graeme Segal [Se1] in the case of 2-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory, and since then he has advocated its more general use in quantum ﬁeld theory. We do not attempt a formal deﬁnition, but rather tell the structure informally and point out some pitfalls. We present this as motivation for this lecture series as we will not delve deeply into non-topological ﬁeld theories which are not invertible. We refer the reader to [Se3, ST] for further material. This approach is the quantum ﬁeld theory version of the Schr¨odinger picture of quantum mechanics; the earlier axioms of Wightman [SW, K] depict quantum ﬁeld theory on ﬂat (non-Wick-rotated) spacetime. There is a Heisenberg picture analog as well. In ﬂat spacetime it goes by the name ‘algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory’ [Ha], and there is a modern geometric version—factorization algebras [CG]—which also has its roots in 2-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory [BeDr]. (For topological versions of factorization algebras, see [L1, §4.1], [AFR].) We begin in §3.1 with an informal discussion of the Axiom System obtained by combining topological ﬁeld theory and Wick-rotated quantum mechanics. Then in §3.2 and 3.3 we tell more systematically how to arrive at Axiom System 3.1 from the traditional starting point of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. One of the main tasks in this lecture is to describe symmetry in quantum ﬁeld theory, culminating in Deﬁnition 3.27 of the symmetry type of a theory. Wick rotation brings us to a compact Lie group 28 of symmetries, and the rigidity of compact Lie groups can be applied to deduce structure theorems. In particular, the Stabilization Theorem 3.24 plays an important role in these lectures when we come to stable homotopy theory in Lecture 6. The passage from Euclidean ﬁeld theory, which is our landing point after Wick rotation, to curved manifolds and the Axiom System 3.1, is very much the passage in geometry from Klein to Cartan, as we explain in §3.5. 28There are theories whose symmetry group is a noncompact Lie group (the easiest ex- ample is a free massless real scalar ﬁeld), a supergroup (any supersymmetric theory), a higher group [GKSW], or a mix of these. In these lectures we restrict to the simpler case of compact Lie groups of symmetries. 43 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 44 3. WICK-ROTATED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND SYMMETRY Two ﬁnal points: (1) It is advantageous when contemplating any quantum ﬁeld theory to identify its symmetry type pH, ρq. (2) The most radical step in Axiom System 3.1 is the restriction to compact manifolds, especially since we want to capture the long range behavior of a theory. It is perhaps not clear at ﬁrst that compact manifolds retain that information; the explicit computations in Lecture 10 are evidence that they do. 3.1. Axiom System for quantum ﬁeld theory As in Axiom System 1.17 a (Wick-rotated, non-topological) ﬁeld theory is a symmetric monoidal functor from a bordism category to a complex linear category. The domain bordism category consists of smooth manifolds with a speciﬁed n- dimensional geometric structure. The objects are closed pn´1q-manifolds embedded in a germ of an n-manifold with that structure; the morphisms are n-dimensional bordisms. The geometric structure can include, among many other possibilities: (i) topological structures as in §1.3; (ii) a Riemannian metric, a conformal struc- ture, a connection on a principal bundle; (iii) a map to a ﬁxed manifold M ,a section of a ﬁber bundle; (iv) etc. The mathematical theory of geometric bor- dism categories is developed in Ayala’s thesis [Ay]. Physicists call these geometric structures background ﬁelds, and a very general notion of ﬁeld is used. There is a mathematical formulation of a ﬁeld [FT1, Appendix A] which encodes the local nature of a ﬁeld in terms of sheaves. In §3.6 we discuss a restricted class of geo- metric structures speciﬁed by a Lie group, the ‘H-structures’29 of Cartan; we gave a ﬂabby topological analog in Deﬁnition 1.40. As for the codomain category, it is as in quantum mechanics (§2.6): a suitable symmetric monoidal category tVectC of topological vector spaces with tensor product. To the extent that we have not formalized these deﬁnitions here, the following is informal. Axiom System 3.1 (Segal). A ﬁeld theory is a symmetric monoidal functor (3.2) F :Bordxn´1,nypX∇ n qÝÑ tVectC . The schematic notation X ∇ n evokes a geometric structure of the type described above. We have already given several topological examples of this structure; some of the simplest non-topological examples are described in 4.3; Example 2.46 is even simpler. Notice that we do not use the adjectives ‘quantum’ and ‘classical’. One possibility is to say that a ﬁeld theory is classical if it is invertible, and it is quantum otherwise, but this is not terminology the author is ready to adopt since invertible ﬁeld theories appear in several contexts outside of (semi)classical ﬁeld theory. Axiom System 3.1 encodes states, observables, and correlation functions: ‚ As already stated the geometric structure consists of background ﬁelds in the physics terminology. Quantum ﬁeld theories are often described in terms of both background and ﬂuctuating ﬁelds; the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds are integrated out using the Feynman path integral. (See Example 1.23, Example 1.44 for topological cases.) So we can view Axiom System 3.1 as encoding the structure one obtains from performing the Feynman path integral, which is not a rigorous mathematical procedure in many cases of interest. Importantly, this formalization of Wick-rotated ﬁeld theory then 29slightly generalized Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 3. WICK-ROTATED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND SYMMETRY 45 applies to theories which do not have a known description in terms of ﬂuc- tuating ﬁelds. (An example of much current interest is the 6-dimensional superconformal p2, 0q-theory.) ‚ The topological vector space F pY q associated to a closed pn ´ 1q-manifold is the state space of the system on the space Y . It can be thought of as the quantization of the system on the Lorentz manifold R ˆ Y .(More precisely, Y is embedded in a germ of a Riemannian n-manifold and one can anti-Wick rotate the metric to a Lorentz metric.) ‚ If X is a closed n-manifold, then F pXqP C is called the partition function. ‚ Let X be a closed n-manifold, x1,... ,xk P X,and pXϵ “ Xz Ťk n“1 Bϵpxiq the bordism obtained by removing open balls of radius ϵ about the points xi; each boundary component is taken to be incoming. The theory F applied to pXϵ gives a multilinear map (3.3) F p pXϵq : F `Sϵpx1q˘ ˆ ¨¨¨ ˆ F `Sϵpxkq˘ ÝÑ C whose inverse limit as ϵ Ñ 0is the Wick-rotated correlation function.The inverse limit (3.4) limÐÝ ϵÑ0 F `Sϵpxiq˘ is the vector space of observables at xi. In the physics literature it is often called the vector space of local operators.30 In theories which depend on a Riemannian metric Axiom System 3.1 encodes scale-dependent information as well as the dynamics which relates diﬀerent scales. There is a useful analogy with diﬀerential equations. Namely, a diﬀerential equa- tion describes a system at short range: it captures the small distance and small time features. One then asks the well-posedness of the equation, i.e., the passage inﬁnitesimal ÝÑ local. In some cases the well-posedness is very delicate. For well- posed equations we can then ask about the global behavior. Here questions center around qualitative features, such as long-time existence, singularity formation, er- godicity, et cetera. The situation is similar in quantum ﬁeld theory: the input to the theory (operator product expansion) describes a system at short range, and the dynamical questions concern the behavior of a solution—an actual theory—at long range. We refer to the discussion in [W1, §1.0]. Remark 3.5. A functor (3.2) encodes both short and long range behavior, but we ought to include a condition analogous to well-posedness. Namely, we should postulate [Se4] an auxiliary conformal ﬁeld theory (but see Remark 3.7) and a statement that it is the short range limit of F . For example, if that auxiliary theory is free, 31 then the theory F is called asymptotically free. Remark 3.6. Suppose the background ﬁelds include a Riemannian metric. Then the renormalization group gives a family Fμ of theories parametrized by μ P Rą0. It is constructed by composing F with the 1-parameter family of automor- phisms of Bordxn´1,nypX∇ n q that scales the Riemannian metric g ÞÑ μ 2g. The con- dition in the previous paragraph concerns the short range limit μ Ñ 0. The global 30The author prefers ‘point operators’ since extended operators—line operators, surface op- erators, etc.—also obey locality properties. 31We do not know a characterization of freeness in the Axiom System. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 46 3. WICK-ROTATED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND SYMMETRY questions of dynamics [W1]—including the classiﬁcation of phases Problem 2.33— concerns the long range limit μ Ñ8. Remark 3.7. Segal considers a variation of Axiom System 3.1 in which the the- ory is only deﬁned for bordisms each component of which has a nonempty incoming boundary. Such theories are termed ‘noncompact’ and they avoid some the ﬁnite- ness restrictions that follow from having coevaluation bordisms. Examples include the massless scalar ﬁelds with values in a noncompact manifold, such as R.The short range limit of a ﬁeld theory may be of noncompact type; see Example 4.38. 3.2. Relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory First, let us review special relativity. Our account of quantum mechanics in Lecture 2 has a time line M1 in the axioms; space is not included. In the example of a particle moving on a manifold, space is treated separately from time. If we take physical space to be Euclidean space Ed, then there is a Galilean spacetime [Ar], [FM1, §2] which exhibits the full symmetry of the system. In special relativity one uses instead Minkowski spacetime, which is a deformation of the Galilean struc- ture [DF1, §1.4]. Standard Minkowski spacetime Mn (n “ d ` 1) is the standard real aﬃne space An equipped with a translationally invariant metric of Lorentz signature. Denote the Lorentzian inner product space of translations as R1,n´1.In terms of standard aﬃne coordinates 32 x0 “ ct, x1,... ,xn´1 on Mn themetricis (3.8) pdx0q2 ´pdx1q2 ´ ¨¨¨ ´ pdxn´1q2. The isometry group I1,n´1 “ IsopMnq is a group of aﬃne transformations, an extension (3.9) 1 ÝÑ R1,n´1 ÝÑ I1,n´1 ÝÑ O1,n´1 ÝÑ 1 with kernel the group of translations and quotient the linear orthogonal group. If n ě 2then π0 O1,n´1 –t˘1uˆt˘1u with two homomorphisms O1,n´1 Ñ t˘1u telling if an orthogonal transformation is (i) orientation-preserving, (ii) time orientation 33 preserving. The identity component of I1,n´1 has a canonical double cover called the Poincar´egroup Pn; it splits over the translation subgroup R1,n´1 Ă I1,n´1.Let k0 P Pn denote the central element of order two. A relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory is, ﬁrst of all, a quantum mechanical sys- tem with symmetry group Pn. (We discuss more general symmetry groups in §3.4.) There is a Hilbert space H which determines the convex space of states as in or- dinary quantum mechanics. To allow both bosonic and fermionic states we take H “ H0 ‘ H1 to be Z{2Z-graded. The bosonic states are homogeneous vectors in H0, the fermionic states homogeneous vectors in H1;see [DeM, §4] for conse- quences of the Koszul sign rule on the Hilbert space structure and operators. In quantum ﬁeld theory one usually ﬁxes a particular pure state called the vacuum. Typically correlation functions are taken with respect to the vacuum state. In quantum mechanics time evolution of states is encoded by a unitary representation 32The constant c is the speed of light. 33There are two components of vectors in R1,n´1 of positive norm square—timelike vectors; the components are preserved or exchanged by an orthogonal transformation. Choose the distin- guished component R 1,n´1 ` Ă R1,n´1 to consist of vectors with positive zeroth component, and in this way time orient Mn. Dually, this induces a notion of positive energy. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 3. WICK-ROTATED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND SYMMETRY 47 of the time translation group R; in quantum ﬁeld theory there is a unitary represen- tation U : Pn Ñ U pHq of the Poincar´e group.34 The vacuum state is assumed to be invariant under U . The restriction U : R1,n´1 Ñ UpHq has a spectral measure σpU q on pR1,n´1q˚; positivity of energy is the hypothesis that σpU q is supported on the closure of the dual forward light cone. The observables form a real vector bundle O Ñ Mn with covariant derivative, and the basic quantities in the theory are cor- relation functions, as in (2.7), now taken at points xi P Mn and with respect to the distinguished vacuum state. Correlation functions are distributions, rather than functions, but nonetheless are called Wightman functions.See [K, §1] for a careful account of the Wightman Axiom System for relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. In the context of the Wightman axioms there are several important general theorems [SW, GJ, K, AgVm]. For example, one version of the spin-statistics theorem asserts that U pk0q is the grading operator on H “ H0 ‘ H1. (Recall that k0 is the central element of the Poincar´e group.) The spin of a representation of Spin1,n´1, the double cover of the identity component O 0 1,n´1, is integer or half- integer according as the representation drops to O 0 1,n´1 or not. The statistics of a homogeneous state is its grading: even or odd. Another important result has the malapropos 35 appellation CPT theorem. Roughly, it states that the symmetry group 36 of the theory includes all orientation-preserving transformations, whereas we only assume initially that the identity component acts. In [FH1, Appendix A] we give a proof, following Jost, for general symmetry types. 3.3. Wick rotation of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory Recall (§2.5) that positivity of energy in quantum mechanics implies that the unitary real time physical quantum theory is the boundary value of a holo- morphic theory deﬁned on a complex domain. This applies both to the time translation representation and the correlation functions. Analogous statements hold in a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. Let R1,n´1 ` Ă R1,n´1 denote the open cone of forward timelike vectors. Then positivity of energy implies that U : R1,n´1 Ñ UpHq is the boundary value of a bounded representation of the com- plex semigroup C1,n´1 ´ “ R1,n´1 ´ ?´1R1,n´1 ` Ă C1,n´1. The corresponding story for correlation functions is more complicated [K, §2.1]. In essence, if we consider a k-point correlation function, then there is a holomorphic function on a complex domain Dk in the k-fold Cartesian product of the complexiﬁcation of Mn such that pMnqˆk sits in the boundary of Dk and the holomorphic function limits on this boundary to the real correlation function. The k-fold Cartesian product pEnqˆk lies in Dk.The Euclidean correlation functions,or Schwinger functions,are the restrictions of the holomorphic correlation functions to pEnqˆk. Remark 3.10. There are many imprecisions here. First, correlation functions are distributions, rather than functions, and we must remove all diagonals to con- sider them as functions. Next, rather than complexify the aﬃne space pMnqˆk, 34The image consists of even unitary transformations, those which preserve the grading H “ H0 ‘ H1. Theories with supersymmetry include odd transformations as well. 35See the discussion in [W2,footnote 8]. 36By Wigner’s theorem (see [F9] and the references therein) symmetries of a quantum system lift to act unitarily or antiunitarily on the Hilbert space H;isometries of Mn which are time orientation-reversing act antiunitarily in a quantum ﬁeld theory.

WICK-ROTATED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND SYMMETRY one uses overall R1,n´1-invariance to descend to the quotient npk ´ 1q-dimensional vector space of diﬀerence vectors. Also, in the analytic continuation one allows per- mutations of the arguments. Finally, to embed En in the complexiﬁcation of Mn we choose a particular time direction, so a splitting R1,n´1 – R ‘ Rn´1 of the real translation group as a sum of time and space translations; the Euclidean translation group is ?´1R ‘ Rn´1. The fundamental reconstruction theorem 37 of Osterwalder-Schrauder [OS]re- verses the Wick oration process: a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory can be recon- structed from Euclidean correlation functions. Here is a schematic depiction of the Wick rotation process: (3.11) Mn „„„◃ D „„„◃ En. To arrive at the Axiom System outlined in §3.1 it remains to pass from Eu- clidean space En to compact manifolds and the bordism category. We do so at the end of this lecture, but ﬁrst discuss more general symmetry groups and their Wick rotations. 3.4. Symmetry groups in quantum ﬁeld theory Let IÒ 1,n´1 Ă I1,n´1 denote the subgroup of time orientation-preserving isome- tries. The traditional approach is to assume the full symmetry group38 G1,n´1 of a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory is a subgroup of a double cover of I Ò 1,n´1 whose identity component is the Poincar´e group. But the more natural hypothesis is that here is a homomorphism 39 G1,n´1 Ñ I Ò 1,n´1 whose image contains the identity component. This is natural geometrically: any symmetry of the geometry/physics happening over Mn induces a symmetry of Mn. The hypothesis about the image captures relativistic invariance. We further assume: (1) The kernel of G1,n´1 Ñ I Ò 1,n´1 is a compact Lie group K, (2) The translation subgroup R1,n´1 Ă I Ò 1,n´1 lifts to a normal subgroup of G1,n´1. The kernel K is the group of internal symmetries, symmetries which ﬁx spacetime pointwise. The compactness rules out examples of ﬁeld theories which may be considered “noncompact” (Remark 3.7), such as a free massless R-valued scalar ﬁeld (in which K is the noncompact translation group of R), or the topological short range limit of 2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory (Example 4.38). Hypothesis (2) essentially means that G1,n´1 is the symmetry group of a translationally-invariant geometric structure on Mn;see [FM1, Remark 2.13] for further comments. Deﬁne H1,n´1 “ G1,n´1{R1,n´1,the vector group of global symmetries. In (3.11) the complexiﬁcation of H1,n´1 acts as symmetries on the complex correlation 37This is a theorem in the Wightman framework for quantum ﬁeld theory; see [K] for an exposition. 38G1,n´1 is a Lie group which consists of “unbroken global” symmetries. In general, we should include odd symmetries (supersymmetries) as well as higher symmetries [GKSW], but we will not do so in these lectures. 39Conformal ﬁeld theories have a diﬀerent structure in which IÒ 1,n´1 is replaced by a larger group of conformal symmetries.

WICK-ROTATED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND SYMMETRY 49 functions and a diﬀerent real form Hn acts on the Wick-rotated Euclidean theory. There is a commutative diagram (3.12) 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004\u0002 \u0003 \u0005\u0005 H1,n´1 \u0004\u0004 \u0002 \u0003 \u0005\u0005 OÒ 1,n´1\u0002 \u0003 \u0005\u0005 1 \u0004\u0004 KpCq \u0004\u0004 HnpCq \u0004\u0004 OnpCq 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0005 \u000b\u000b Hn ρn \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0005 \u000b\u000b On \u0004\u0005 \u000b\u000b of Lie groups. We have included the hypothesis: (3) The kernel of ρn : Hn Ñ On is the same compact real form K Ă KpCq as the kernel of H1,n´1 Ñ OÒ 1,n´1. In other words, the internal symmetry group does not change under Wick rotation. Remark 3.13. Since the image of H1,n´1 Ñ OÒ 1,n´1 includes the identity com- ponent, the image of ρn is either SOn or On. In the latter case the theory has time-reversing symmetries, whereas in the former case it does not. The Lie group Hn is the vector symmetry group of the Euclidean theory. It is a compact Lie group. The rigidity of compact Lie groups leads to structure theorems which are important in quantum ﬁeld theory generally and here in subsequent lectures. Proofs are in [FH1, §2]. Deﬁne SHn “ ρ´1 n pSOnq and let ĄSH n be the double cover of SHn constructed from the spin double cover of SOn.These compact Lie groups are usefully encoded in the pullback diagram (3.14) 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 ĄSH n 2:1 \u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 \u0004\u0004 Spinn 2:1 \u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 \u0004\u0004 1 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 SHn\u0002 \u0003 1:2 \u0005\u0005 \u0004\u0004 SOn\u0002 \u0003 1:2 \u0005\u0005 \u0004\u0004 1 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 Hn ρn \u0004\u0004 On If ρn : Hn Ñ On is surjective, deﬁne rHn as the pullback40 (3.15) 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 rHn \u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 ρn \u0004\u0004 Pin` n \u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 \u0004\u0004 1 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 Hn ρn \u0004\u0004 On \u0004\u0004 1 Let k, hn, on denote the Lie algebras of K, Hn, On. Proposition 3.16. Assume n ě 3.

WICK-ROTATED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY AND SYMMETRY (2) If n ě 3 there is an isomorphism ĄSH n – Spinn ˆK. Hence there exists a central element k0 P K with pk0q2 “ 1 and an isomorphism (3.17) SHn – Spinn ˆK L xp´1,k0qy, where xp´1,k0qy is the cyclic group generated by p´1,k0q. (3) There is a canonical homomorphism Spinn Ñ Hn under which the image of the central element ´1 P Spinn is k0 P K. (4) If n ě 3 and ρn : Hn Ñ On is surjective, then there exists a group exten- sion (3.18) 1 ÝÑ K ÝÑ J ÝÑ t˘1uÝÑ 1 and a pullback diagram of group extensions (3.19) 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 rHn \u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 ρn \u0004\u0004 Pin` n \u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 \u0004\u0004 1 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 J \u0004\u0004 t˘1u \u0004\u0004 1 There is an isomorphism (3.20) Hn – rHn L xp´1,k0qy. Part (1) is the analog in our approach of the Coleman-Mandula theorem [CM]; Part (2) a splitting at the level of Lie groups rather than Lie algebras. Part (3), anti Wick-rotated back to Minkowski spacetime, produces a homomorphism Pn Ñ G1,n´1 of the Poincar´e group into the total symmetry group of the theory, the traditional starting point. The pullback (3.19) in Part (4) shows that the failure of rHn to be a product is encoded in the group extension (3.18), which is independent of n. Remark 3.21. Let n “ 3and H3 “ Z{2Z ˙pSO3 ˆ SO3q, where the nontrivial element of Z{2Z acts by shearing pg1,g2q ÞÑpg1,g1g2q. Deﬁne ρ3 : H3 Ñ O3 to kill the last factor K “ SO3 and send the generator of Z{2Z to the central element ´1 P O3.Then H3 is not a possible symmetry group; it violates Proposition 3.16(4). For n “ 2 we are allowed SH2 “ Z{2Z ˙pT ˆ Tq with involution pλ1,λ2q ÞÑ pλ1,λ´1 1 λ´1 2 q on T ˆ T. This illustrates the dimension restriction in Part (2) of Proposition 3.16. The rigidity of compact Lie groups also leads to easy classiﬁcation theorems. Example 3.22. If K “t1u is trivial, then Hn – SOn or On.Let μ4 Ă T be the group of 4 th roots of unity. Deﬁne En Ă On ˆμ4 as the subgroup of pA, λq such that det A “ λ2.Then if K –t˘1u is cyclic of order two, there are 6 possibilities for Hn up to isomorphism: SOn ˆt˘1u, Spinn,On ˆt˘1u, En,Pin ` n ,Pin ´ n .If we demand that k0 be the non-identity element of K, then we are left with 3 possibilities: Spinn,Pin` n ,Pin´ n .

The main structure result we need about symmetry groups in quantum ﬁeld theory is a stabilization of Hn. Theorem 3.24. Assume n ě 3. There exist compact Lie groups Hm, m ą n, and homomorphisms in,ρn which ﬁt into the commutative diagram (3.25) Hn\u0005 \u0002 in \u0004\u0004 ρn \u0005\u0005 Hn`1 \u0005 \u0002 in`1 \u0004\u0004 ρn`1 \u0005\u0005 Hn`2 \u0005 \u0002 \u0004\u0004 ρn`2 \u0005\u0005 ...

The internal symmetry group K “ ker ρn is independent of n. Theorem 3.24 allows us to speak about symmetry groups in quantum ﬁeld theory independent of dimension. Set (3.26) H “ colim nÑ8 Hn. For Hn “ SOn we obtain H “ SO8 “ SO. Thus we can speak of ‘oriented theories’=‘SO theories’, ‘Spin theories’, ‘Pin` theories’, etc. Set O “ O8 “ colim nÑ8 On. The colimit of (3.25) is a homomorphism ρ : H Ñ O with kernel K. Definition 3.27. The homomorphism ρ : H Ñ O is called the symmetry type and is denoted pH, ρq. By pullback (3.25) we obtain pHn,ρnq for all n P Zą0. Theorem 3.24 lets us reconstruct pH, ρq from pHn,ρnq, hence we also use the term ‘symmetry type’ for the pair pHn,ρnq. Remark 3.28. The proof uses Hypothesis (3) following (3.12) above to rule out some groups which do not admit stabilizations. As an example of a group which is excluded, let n “ 3and H3 “ Z{2Z ˙pSO3 ˆ SO3q, where the nontrivial element of Z{2Z acts by shearing pg1,g2q ÞÑpg1,g1g2q; the homomorphism ρ3 which kills the second factor K “ SO3 maps H3 Ñ O3 and sends the generator of Z{2Z to the central element ´1 P O3.

Interlude on diﬀerential geometry The last stage in the progression from relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory on Minkowski spacetime Mn to the Axiom System 3.1 is the passage from Euclidean space En to curved manifolds. This is familiar in diﬀerential geometry—the passage from Klein’s Erlangen Programm [BB]to Cartan’s H-structures.41 We digress brieﬂy to explain this perspective.

Aﬃne geometry has a global parallelism encoded in the simply transitive action of the translation group. The curved analog of aﬃne geometry is the inﬁnitesimal parallelism of an aﬃne connection on a smooth manifold [KN]. It is natural42 to demand that the aﬃne connection be torsionfree, roughly the condition that “parallelograms” close to leading order. (Recall that an aﬃne connection on a smooth n-manifold M is a connection on the principal GLn R-bundle of frames BpM qÑ M .) 41Cartan considers only pairs pHn,ρnq in which ρn : Hn Ñ GLn R is an injective homomorphism. 42Well, certainly convenient. But the Cartan theory of H-structures is much, much richer [S] and the torsionfree requirement limits the examples substantially. In quantum ﬁeld theory the image of ρn lies in On and we are in the realm of Riemannian geometry and the unique torsionfree Levi-Civita connection.

Let pHn,ρnq be a Cartan symmetry type. A diﬀerential Hn-structure on a smooth n-manifold M is a triple pP, Θ,ϕq,where P Ñ M is a principal Hn-bundle with connection Θ and 43 ϕ : BpM qÑ ρnpP q is an isomorphism of principal GLn R-bundles such that ϕ˚ρnpΘq is torsionfree. There is a category of manifolds equipped with diﬀerential Hn-structure and their diﬀeomorphisms. Hn-geometry is the study of invariants in this category. 3.6. Wick-rotated ﬁeld theory on compact manifolds Just as we pass from aﬃne geometry to curved manifolds, and with On sym- metry from Euclidean geometry to Riemannian geometry, so too we pass from Euclidean ﬁeld theory to Axiom System 3.1: Wick-rotated ﬁeld theory on compact manifolds. Remark 3.34. The restriction to compact manifolds is potentially a radical step if one is interested in long range behavior, since the “range” of a compact manifold is bounded above. Yet we will see that in at least one class of examples the information about the long range theory is retained. For a theory with symmetry type pHn,ρnq the domain of the Wick-rotated theory is the bordism category Bordxn´1,nypH ∇ n q of pn ´ 1q-and n-dimensional manifolds with diﬀerential Hn-structure. The theory itself is then a symmetric monoidal functor (3.35) F :Bordxn´1,nypH ∇ n qÝÑ tVectC, as in (3.2). As discussed in §3.1 the functor F encodes the states spaces, observables, and correlation functions of the Wick-rotated theory. The passage to compact manifolds completes the procession (3.11): (3.36) Mn „„„◃ D „„„◃ En „„„◃ X n. One can hope for a reconstruction theorem which reverses (3.36), and perhaps such structural theorems lie in the future, after a precise formulation of the Axiom System (see Remark 3.5). A major challenge is to construct examples. In the topological case the future is now: there is a rigorous theory with abundant examples and no issue about reconstruction. The twin pillars of quantum ﬁeld theory—locality and unitarity— have been developed beyond what is traditionally discussed for physical theories, and these extensions play a crucial role in what follows; see Lecture 5 and Lecture 7. The view of non-topological ﬁeld theories through the lens of the Axiom System is important for our story—and, experience teaches, provides a powerful tool for exploring quantum ﬁeld theory more generally. 43ρnpP qÑ M is the associated principal GLn R-bundle with connection ρnpΘq.

LECTURE 4 Classiﬁcation Theorems It is diﬃcult to contemplate attacking a classiﬁcation problem in mathematics without a deﬁnition, or axiom system, for the object being classiﬁed. While that may sound anodyne or tautological, it is hardly so away from mathematics. Indeed our central Problem 2.33 is a classiﬁcation problem in physics without a deﬁnition or axiom system (for lattice systems). Returning to mathematics, sometimes there is uniqueness in which case an axiom system is a characterization: the real num- bers form the unique complete ordered ﬁeld. Other times one extracts invariants to distinguish inequivalent objects and, in some cases, a complete invariant. For example, the fundamental group of the complement of a knot in S3 is a powerful, but not complete, invariant. In any case it is the deﬁnition of a knot—a connected 1-dimensional closed submanifold of S3—that enables us to classify at all. In this lecture we illustrate how Axiom System 1.17 for topological ﬁeld theory enables us to prove classiﬁcation theorems in low dimensions. We also state clas- siﬁcation theorems for non-topological ﬁeld theories, based on variations of Axiom System 3.1. The proofs use Morse and Cerf theory, so illustrate techniques used in topological ﬁeld theory, in particular those which enter at least one approach to the cobordism hypothesis (§5.6). In §4.3 we study 2-dimensional ﬁeld theories of manifolds with an area form. These are perhaps the simplest non-topological ﬁeld theories and provide good examples and illustrations of the ideas in Lecture 3. They also provide an explicit example of short range and long range behavior of a scale-dependent physical system. We conclude with another classiﬁcation theorem: the 1-dimensional cobordism hypothesis for oriented manifolds. Stolz-Teichner and their collaborators have proved classiﬁcation theorems for non-topological ﬁeld theories in low dimensions; see [ST] for a sample of their results. 4.1. Review of Morse and Cerf theory Let M be a smooth manifold and f : M Ñ R a smooth function. Recall that p P M is a critical point if dfp “ 0. A number c P R is a critical value if f ´1pcq contains a critical point. At a critical point p the second diﬀerential, or Hessian, (4.1) d 2fp : TpM ˆ TpM ÝÑ R is a well-deﬁned symmetric bilinear form. To evaluate it on ξ1,ξ2 P TpM extend ξ2 to a vector ﬁeld to near p,and set d 2fppξ1,ξ2q“ ξ1ξ2f ppq, the iterated directional derivative. We say p is a nondegenerate critical point if the Hessian (4.1) is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form. Lemma 4.2 (Morse). If p is a nondegenerate critical point of the function f : M Ñ R, then there exists a local coordinate system x1,... ,xn about p such 55 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 56 4.

The number n ´ r of minus signs in (4.3) is the index of the critical point p.A function is Morse if each of its critical points is nondegenerate. An application of Sard’s theorem proves that Morse functions exist, and in fact are open and dense in the space of C 8 functions [H, §6.1]. If X is a manifold with boundary we consider smooth functions which are constant on BX and have no critical points on BX. The following terminology is apparently due to Thom. X a1 a0 c4 c3 c2 c1 Y1 Y0 f Figure 4.1. An excellent Morse function on a bordism Definition 4.4. Let X : Y0 Ñ Y1 be a bordism. An excellent Morse function f : X Ñ R satisﬁes (1) f pY0q“ a0 is constant; (2) f pY1q“ a1 is constant; and (3) the critical points x1,... ,xN are nondegenerate with distinct critical val- ues c1,... ,cN which satisfy (4.5) a0 ă c1 ă ¨¨¨ ă cN ă a1. We depict an excellent Morse function on a bordism in Figure 4.1. The space of excellent Morse functions on a bordism is dense in the space of C 8 functions. The basic theorems of Morse theory tell the structure of Xa1,a2 “ f ´1pra1,a2sq if a1,a2 are regular values. If there are no critical values in ra1,a2s,then Xa1,a2 is diﬀeomorphic to the Cartesian product of ra1,a2s and Y “ f ´1paq for any a P ra1,a2s. If there is a single critical value c Pra1,a2s and f ´1pcq contains a single critical point of index r,then Xa1,a2 is obtained from Xa1,c´ϵ by attaching an n- dimensional r-handle. We can also deduce the Morse surgery which constructs the level set Xa2 “ f ´1pa2q from Xa1 “ f ´1pa1q. A neighborhood of the critical point is the closed n-ball Dr ˆ Dn´r, and the surgery is the transition (4.6) Sr´1 ˆ Dn´r „„„◃ Dr ˆ Sn´r´1 which happens in a neighborhood of the critical point in passing from Xa1 to Xa2. See [Mi2, H, PT] for detailed treatments and many applications, including classi- ﬁcation theorems for manifolds of dimension ď 2.

Some elementary 2-dimensional bordisms Definition 4.7. Abordism X : Y0 Ñ Y1 is an elementary bordism if it admits an excellent Morse function with a single critical point. The elementary 2-dimensional bordisms are depicted in Figure 4.2.

Excellent functions connected by a path of excellent Morse functions lead to an equivalent decomposition: corresponding elementary bordisms are diﬀeomorphic. Track the equivalence class by means of a Kirby graphic (Figure 4.3) which indicates the distribution of critical points and their indices. The space of excellent Morse functions is not connected; a bordism has (inﬁnitely) many decompositions with diﬀerent Kirby graphics. Jean Cerf [Ce] studied a ﬁltration on the space of smooth functions. The subleading part of the ﬁltration connects diﬀerent components of excellent Morse functions. Definition 4.9. A smooth function f : M Ñ R on an n-manifold M has a birth-death singularity at p P M if there exist local coordinates x1,... ,xn in which (4.10) f “px1q3 `px1q2 ` ¨¨¨ ` pxrq2 ´pxr`1q2 ´ ¨¨¨ ´ pxnq2 ` c The index of p is deﬁned to be n ´ r.

Let X : Y0 Ñ Y1 be a bordism and f : X Ñ R asmooth function. (1) f is good of Type α if f is excellent Morse except at a single point at which f has a birth-death singularity. (2) f is good of Type β if f is excellent Morse except that there exist exactly two critical points xi,xi`1 with the same critical value f pxiq“ f pxi`1q. We say f is good if it is either excellent Morse or good of Type α or good of Type β. Theorem 4.12 (Cerf [Ce]). Let X : Y0 Ñ Y1 be a bordism. Then the space of good functions is connected. More precisely, if f0,f1 are excellent Morse, then there exists a path ft of good functions such that ft is excellent Morse except at ﬁnitely many values of t. There is an even more precise statement. The space of good functions is an inﬁnite dimensional manifold, the space of good functions which are not excellent Morse is a codimension one submanifold, and we can arrange that the path t ÞÑ ft cross this submanifold transversely, hence at ﬁnitely many values of t. A path of good functions has an associated Kirby graphic which encodes the excellent chambers and wall crossings of the path. The horizontal variable is t and the vertical is the critical value. The curves in the graphic are labeled by the index of the critical point in the preimage. Birth-death singularities occur with critical points of neighboring indices. Paths can also pass through a wall of Type β in which the critical values of two critical points exchange which is larger. Kirby uses these graphics in his calculus [Ky]. Figure 4.4 shows some simple Kirby graphics. Figure 4.4. Kirby graphics of a birth, death, and exchange Example 4.13. The prototype for crossing a wall of Type α is the path of functions (4.14) ftpxq“ x3 3 ´ tx deﬁned for x P R.Then ft is Morse for t ­“ 0, has no critical points if t ă 0, and has two critical points x “˘ ?t for t ą 0. As t increases through t “ 0the two critical points are born; as t decreases through t “ 0 they die. The critical values are ˘t 3{2, up to a multiplicative constant, which explains the shape of the Kirby graphic, the ﬁrst picture in Figure 4.4. 4.2. Classiﬁcation of 2-dimensional topological ﬁeld theories We begin with some algebra. Definition 4.15. Let k be a ﬁeld. A commutative Frobenius algebra pA, τ q over k is a ﬁnite dimensional unital commutative associative algebra A over k and Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 4. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS 59 a linear map τ : A Ñ k such that (4.16) A ˆ A ÝÑ k x, y ÞÝÑ τ pxyq is a nondegenerate pairing. Example 4.17 (Frobenius). Let G be a ﬁnite group. Let A be the vector space of functions f : G Ñ C which are central : (4.18) f pgxg´1q“ f pxq for all x, g P G. Deﬁne multiplication as convolution: (4.19) pf1 ˚ f2qpxq“ ÿ x1x2“x f1px1qf2px2q. A straightforward check shows ˚ is commutative and associative and the unit is the “δ-function at e”, which is 1 at the identity e P G and 0 elsewhere. The trace is (4.20) τ pf q“ f peq #G . If we remove the central condition (4.18), then we obtain the noncommutative Frobenius algebra of all complex-valued functions on G. Example 4.21. Let M be a closed oriented n-manifold. Then H ‚pM ; Cq is a super commutative Frobenius algebra. Multiplication is cup product and the trace is evaluation on the fundamental class. ‘Super’ reﬂects the sign in the cup product. For M “ S2 we obtain an ordinary commutative Frobenius algebra since there is no odd cohomology. The commutative Frobenius algebra H ‚pS2; Cq, or rather the commutative Frobenius ring H ‚pS2; Zq, is a key ingredient in the construction of Khovanov homology [Kh]. The following classiﬁcation theorem was well-known by the late 1980s. It ap- pears in Dijkgraaf’s thesis [Dij]. Mathematical treatments are given in [Ab, Ko]. TheMorse theory proofwe givehereistaken from [MS, Appendix]. Theorem 4.22. Let F :Bordx1,2ypSO2qÑ Vectk be a topological ﬁeld theory. Then F pS1q is a commutative Frobenius algebra. Conversely, if A is a commu- tative Frobenius algebra, then there exists a 2-dimensional topological ﬁeld theory FA :Bordx1,2ypSO2qÑ Vectk such that FApS1q“ A. The theory FA is unique up to isomorphism. Remark 4.23. The 2-dimensional ﬁeld theory constructed from the Frobenius algebra in Example 4.17 is the ﬁnite gauge theory of Example 1.23. Recall that it has a “classical” description: it counts principal G-bundles. The invariant F pXq of a closed surface of genus g is given by a classical formula of Frobenius. (For a lattice approach, see [Sny].) Topological ﬁeld theory provides a proof of that formula by cutting a surface of genus g into elementary pieces. Proof. Given F :Bordx1,2ypSO2qÑ Vectk deﬁne the vector space A “ F pS1q. The elementary bordisms in Figure 4.5 deﬁne a unit u : k Ñ A,atrace τ : A Ñ k, and a multiplication m : A b A Ñ A. (We read “time” as ﬂowing up in these bor- disms; the bottom boundaries are incoming and the top boundaries are outgoing.) The bilinear form (4.16) is the composition in Figure 4.6, and it has an inverse Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 60 4. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS given by the cylinder with both boundary components outgoing, as is proved by the S-diagram argument (Lemma 1.20). Therefore, it is nondegenerate. This proves that pA, u, m, τ q is a commutative Frobenius algebra. mτu Figure 4.5. Elementary bordisms which deﬁne the Frobenius structure Figure 4.6. The bilinear form Next, we compute the map m ˚ deﬁned by time-reversal 44 Let x1,... ,xn and x1,... ,xn be dual bases of A relative to (4.16): τ pxixjq“ δi j.Then (4.24) m˚ : A ÝÑ A b A x ÞÝÑ xxi b xi This is the adjoint of multiplication relative to the pairing (4.16). Similarly, note that the unit u “ τ ˚ is adjoint to the trace. These adjunctions follow from general duality in symmetric monoidal categories (§A.2): duality in the bordism category is eﬀected by time-reversal (see Lemma 7.26), and the dual of an object in the category of vector spaces is the dual vector space. A symmetric monoidal functor, such as FA, maps duals to duals. Figure 4.7. The adjoint m˚ For the converse, suppose A is a commutative Frobenius algebra. We construct a 2-dimensional topological ﬁeld theory FA. It is easy to prove that the topological group Diﬀ SOpS1q of orientation-preserv- ing diﬀeomorphisms deformation retracts onto the group of rotations, which is 44The time-reversed bordism replaces p : BX Ñt0, 1u with 1 ´ p: it exchanges incoming and outgoing. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 4. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS 61 connected. Since diﬀeomorphisms act on A through their isotopy class, the action is trivial. Thus if Y is any oriented manifold diﬀeomorphic to a circle, there is up to isotopy a unique orientation-preserving diﬀeomorphism Y Ñ S1. For any closed oriented 1-manifold Y deﬁne FApY q“ Abp#π0Y q; orientation-preserving diﬀeomorphisms of closed 1-manifolds act as the identity. The values of FA on elementary 2-dimensional bordisms (Figure 4.2) are given by the structure maps u “ τ ˚,τ,m,m˚ of the Frobenius algebra. An arbitrary bordism is a composition of elementary bordisms (tensor identity maps) via an excellent Morse function, and we use such a decomposition to deﬁne FA. However we must check that the value is independent of the excellent Morse function. For that we use Cerf’s Theorem 4.12. It suﬃces to check what happens when we cross awall ofType α or of Type β. First, a simpliﬁcation. Since time-reversal implements duality, if an equality of maps holds for a wall-crossing it also holds for its time-reversal. This cuts down the number of diagrams one needs to consider. 1 0 1 01 2 1 2 Figure 4.8. The four Type α wall-crossings There are four Type α wall-crossings, as indicated by their Kirby graphics in Figure 4.8. The numbers indicate the indices of the critical points. If ft is a path of Morse functions with the ﬁrst Kirby graphic, then the three subsequent ones may be realized by ´ft, f1´t,and ´f1´t, respectively. (Here 0 ď t ď 1.) It follows that we need only check the ﬁrst. The corresponding transition of bordisms is indicated in Figure 4.9. These bordisms both map to idA : A Ñ A: for the ﬁrst this expresses that u is an identity for multiplication m. 1 0 Figure 4.9. Crossing a birth-death singularity In a Type β wall-crossing there are two critical points and the critical levels cross. So on either side of the wall the bordism X is a composition of two elementary bordisms. Assume X is connected or else there is nothing to prove. Furthermore, if the indices of the critical points are r1,r2, then the Euler number of the bordism is p´1qr1 `p´1qr2,byelementaryMorse theory. Let C denote the critical contour at the critical time tcrit, when the two critical levels cross. Since the bordism is connected there are two possibilities: either C is connected or it consists of two components, each with a single critical point. In the latter case there would have Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 62 4. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS to be another critical point in the bordism to connect the two components, else the bordism would not be connected. Therefore, C is connected and it follows easily that both critical points have index 1, hence X has Euler number ´2. Now in each elementary bordism (Figure 4.2) the number of incoming and outgoing circles diﬀers by one, so in a composition of two elementary bordisms the number of circles changes by two or does not change at all. This leads to four possibilities for the number of circles: 1 Ñ 1, 2 Ñ 2, 3 Ñ 1, or 1 Ñ 3. The last is the time-reversal of the penultimate, so we have three cases to consider. Figure 4.10. 1 Ñ 1 The ﬁrst, 1 Ñ 1, is a torus with two disks removed. Figure 4.10 is not at the critical time—the two critical levels are distinct. Note that at a regular value between the two critical values, the level curve has two components, by the classi- ﬁcation of elementary bordisms (Figure 4.2). So the composition is (4.25) A m˚ ÝÝÝÝÑ A b A m ÝÝÝÑ A Passing through the Type β wall we emerge to an isomorphic bordism, so to the same linear map (4.25). Figure 4.11. 2 Ñ 1 Ñ 2 The second case, 2 Ñ 2, is somewhat more complicated than the others. The numbers of circles in the composition on the two sides of the wall are 2 Ñ 1 Ñ 2 and 2 Ñ 3 Ñ 2. The 2 Ñ 1 Ñ 2 composition, depicted in Figure 4.11, is m˚ ˝ m, which is the map (4.26) x b y ÞÝÑ xy ÞÝÑ xyxi b xi, using the dual bases introduced above.

Do there exist λi such that FApXgq in Exercise 4.30 is computed by a formula of this shape? I do not know a “classical model” for the theory FA in Exercise 4.30, as opposed, say, to ﬁnite gauge theory (Example 1.23). Thus Theorem 4.22 is a direct quantum construction of a ﬁeld theory. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 64 4. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS Theorem 4.22 has many generalizations. What follows is an incomplete list and a small sample of references. The spin case is treated in [MS, Gu]. The unoriented case is in [AlNa, TT, S-P1]. The oriented case with a background principal G- bundle is treated in many references, among them [Tu, MS, Dav]. 4.3. 2-dimensional area-dependent theories In general, as described in Lecture 3, a Wick-rotated quantum ﬁeld theory is deﬁned on a bordism category of Riemannian manifolds. A Riemannian metric can be regarded as two pieces of data: a conformal structure and a volume form. There are special quantum ﬁeld theories which depend on just one part of the metric.45 Many interesting and important ﬁeld theories just depend on the conformal struc- ture, and indeed conformal ﬁeld theories appear as short range or long range limits of general theories. In this section we study the opposite case of theories which depend only on a volume form. The simplest case, beyond quantum mechanics, is the 2-dimensional case of a theory depending on an area form. We follow the lecture notes [Se2, §1.4]. First, a theorem of Moser states that up to diﬀeomorphism the only invariant of a volume form on a compact connected manifold is the total volume. Theorem 4.32 ([Mos]). Let M be a compact connected oriented n-manifold with boundary, and suppose ω0,ω1 P Ωn M satisfy ş M ω0 “ ş M ω1. Then there exists a diﬀeomorphism ϕ : M Ñ M such that ϕ˚ω1 “ ω0. Proof. Choose η P Ωn´1 M such that ω1 ´ ω0 “ dη.Set ωt “ ω0 ` tdη,0 ď t ď 1. Then ωt is a volume form, so there exists a unique vector ﬁeld ξt such that ιξtωt ` η “ 0. Let ϕ be the ﬂow generated by the time-varying vector ﬁeld ξt.Then (4.33) d dt pϕ˚ t ωtq“ ϕ˚ t pLξtωt ` d dt ωtq“ ϕ˚ t dpιξt ωt ` ηq“ 0, hence ϕ˚ 1 ω1 “ ω0. This completes the proof if M is closed. If BM ­“ 0we must be careful to choose η so that ξt is tangent to BM . In fact, we can and do arrange that η, hence ξt, vanishes on BM .Namely, if λ P Ωn´1 BM then the pair pω, λq represents an element in the relative de Rham cohomology group H n dRpM, BM q. Recall [BT, p. 78] the isomorphism (4.34) H n dRpM, BM qÝÑ R pω, λq ÞÝÑ ż M ω ´ ż BM λ. Thus pω0, 0q and pω1, 0q are cohomologous in H n dRpM, BM q, so we can ﬁnd p˜η, μqP Ωn´1 M ˆ Ωn´2 BM such that d˜η “ ω1 ´ ω0 and dμ ` i ˚ ˜η “ 0, where i : BM ãÑ M is the inclusion. Choose a collar neighborhood U of BM and a cutoﬀ function ρ : U Ñr0, 1s such that ρ “ 1 in a neighborhood of BM and vanishes outside of U . Set η “ ˜η ` dpρμq. □ Exercise 4.35. Give a proof of the Morse lemma using the Moser technique. As a consequence of Theorem 4.32, in the bordism category of oriented n- manifolds with volume form, the non-topological information in a morphism—an n- dimensional bordism up to diﬀeomorphism—is the total volume of each component. 45Topological ﬁeld theories depend on neither. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 4. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS 65 In that sense a ﬁeld theory F depending only on a volume form is just one step removed from a topological theory. Next, we elaborate on the topological vector space assigned to an object in a ﬁeld theory (3.2), at least in theories which depend only on a volume form. Let Y n´1 be a closed manifold. The cylinder r0, 1sˆ Y with total volume t P Rą0 induces an endomorphism Ut of the topological vector space F pY q. With suitable hypotheses on the category tVectC we can deduce that t ÞÑ Ut is a continuous semigroup of trace class operators. We obtain a directed system of topological vector spaces parametrized by Rą0;let qF pY q, pF pY q denote the colimit as t Ñ8 and limit as t Ñ 0, respectively.46 We can replace F pY q with qF pY q.Then a vector ξ P F pY q can be expressed as Utξt for any t ą 0. Segal [Se2, Proposition 1.4.3] states a classiﬁcation theorem in the 2-dimen- sional case. Suppose F is a 2-dimensional theory of oriented manifolds with area form. Then A “ F pS1q does not depend on an area form; all area forms on a germ of S1 are equivalent. Deﬁne a multiplication on A as follows (see Figure 4.5): choose s, t P Rą0 and let X be the pair of pants of total area s ` t. Then the product of Usξ, Utη P A is F pXqpξ b ηq. The disk of area t P Rą0 with outgoing boundary gives a vector εt P A, and there is a limit lim tÑ0 εt. It follows from the usual gluing argument that Ut is multiplication by εt.The trace τ : A Ñ C is the value of F on the disk of unit area with incoming boundary. Proposition 4.36 ([Se2]). There is an equivalence between 2-dimensional the- ories of oriented manifolds with area form and triples pA, τ, εtq in which A is a com- mutative topological algebra; τ : A Ñ C a nondegenerate trace; and εt P A satisfy εt Ñ 1 as t Ñ 0, εt1 εt1 “ εt1`t2 , and multiplication by εt is a trace class operator on A. The recent paper [RS] by Runkel-Szegedy has a careful treatment of this theorem. Remark 4.37. The renormalization group acts on the space of these theories by scaling the total area of bordisms; see Remark 3.6. The short range “limit” takes the area to 0, the long range “limit” takes the area to 8. In general there is no limit, but for theories which depend only on a volume form if the limit exists it is a topological theory, hence by Theorem 4.22 is given by a commutative Frobenius algebra. In the context of Proposition 4.36 short range is t Ñ 0 and long range is t Ñ8.If A is inﬁnite dimensional, then t Ñ 0 does not lead to a ﬁnite theory: in a 2-dimensional topological theory the vector space attached to S1 is ﬁnite dimensional (Corollary 1.21). We can hope, though, for a theory of noncompact type (Remark 3.7). On the other hand, if Ut converges to a ﬁnite rank projection operator as t Ñ8, then there is a topological ﬁeld theory which is the long range limit. Example 4.38. Let G be a compact Lie group. If G is ﬁnite, then the asso- ciated gauge theory is topological and was already treated in Example 1.23. The corresponding Frobenius algebra is described in Example 4.17. For dim G ą 0we cannot simply count G-bundles. The standard procedure in physics introduces a connection and sums (path integrates) over connections.

CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS factor is the Yang-Mills action, which in 2 dimensions depends on an area form but not on the conformal structure. See [W3], [Mig], [W1, Lecture 11] for more details about this physically deﬁned theory. Segal [Se2, §1.5] argues that under the equivalence in Proposition 4.36, this 2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory corresponds to the triple (4.39) A “ center of C 8pGq under convolution, τ pf q“ f p1q, εt “ e ´tΔpδ1q. Here Δ is the Laplace operator with respect to a bi-invariant metric47 on G,and δ1 is Dirac’s δ-distribution supported at the identity 1 P G. We make two observations. ‚ lim tÑ8 εt exists and is a constant function on G. Therefore, the long range limit exists and is an invertible theory: dim A8 “ 1. One-dimensional Frobenius algebras have a single parameter, τ p1q, which in this case is determined by the total volume of G. This invertible theory is an Euler theory ϵμ (1.53) for some μ determined by VolpGq. ‚ The invariant in 2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory of a closed oriented sur- face of genus g and area t is (4.40) ÿ V e ´tλV pc dim V q2g´2 for some c ą 0, where the sum runs over isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of G. The limit t Ñ 0existsif 2g ´ 2 ą 0, i.e., for surfaces of negative Euler number, so the short range topological theory is only partially deﬁned: it is a noncompact theory. As t Ñ 0 only the trivial representation survives in the sum (4.40). 4.4. Classiﬁcation of 1-dimensional ﬁeld theories Of course, 1-dimensional ﬁeld theories have a simpler structure than 2-dimen- sional theories, but we take a diﬀerent approach than above to illustrate diﬀerent aspects. We begin with topological theories with a general codomain category, which foreshadows the setup of extended ﬁeld theories in Lecture 5. The classiﬁ- cation result Theorem 4.46 is a special case of the much more general cobordism hypothesis (Theorem 5.34). The oriented bordism group in dimension zero is the free abelian group on one generator: Ω0pSOq– Z. This simple theorem can be restated in terms of bor- dism invariants as follows. Let M be any commutative monoid. Then the set of 0-dimensional bordism invariants with values in M is isomorphic to the commuta- tive monoid HompΩ0pSOq,M q, where the sum F ` G of two bordism invariants is computed element-wise: pF `GqpY q“ F pY q`GpY q for all compact 0-manifolds Y . (See Remark 1.11.) Then F pY q is automatically invertible, since Ω0pSOq is a group. Let M „ Ă M be the group of units (invertible elements). 47The metric is needed to deﬁne the action of 2-dimensional Yang-Mills. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 4. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS 67 Theorem 4.41 (Cobordism hypothesis—set version). The map (4.42) Φ: HompΩ0pSOq,M qÝÑ M „ F ÞÝÑ F ppt`q is an isomorphism of abelian groups. Now categorify. Fix a symmetric monoidal category C and let (4.43) TFTSO x0,1ypCq“ Hom bpBordx0,1ypSO1q,Cq be the category of topological 1-dimensional oriented ﬁeld theories with values in C, so (Axiom System 1.17) symmetric monoidal functors from the bordism category to C. Lemma 4.44. A morphism pη : F Ñ GqP TFTSO x0,1ypCq is invertible: TFTSO x0,1ypCq is a groupoid. This follows from Proposition A.44 in the appendix. We need the following categorical notion of ﬁniteness in the symmetric monoidal situation. Recall Deﬁnition A.14 of a full subcategory. Definition 4.45. Let C be a symmetric monoidal category. Deﬁne C fd Ă C as the full subcategory whose objects are the dualizable objects of C. The notation ‘fd’ puts in mind ‘ﬁnite dimensional’, which is correct for the cate- gory Vect: dualizable vector spaces are those which are ﬁnite dimensional (Exer- cise 1.22). It also stands for ‘fully dualizable’, though in the 1-dimensional case ‘fully’ is not relevant: fully dualizable “ dualizable. (See §5.6 for a discussion of full dualizability.) Let pC fdq„ Ă C fd be the groupoid of units (Deﬁnition A.17). Theorem 4.46 (Cobordism hypothesis—1-categorical version). Let C be a symmetric monoidal category. Then the map (4.47) Φ: TFTSO x0,1ypCqÝÑpC fdq„ F ÞÝÑ F ppt`q is an equivalence of groupoids. The map Φ is well-deﬁned since F ppt`q is dualizable; see Proposition A.44(1). The proof relies on the classiﬁcation of closed 0-manifolds and compact 1- manifolds with boundary [Mi1]. Note that if Y0,Y1 are closed 0-manifolds which are diﬀeomorphic, then the set of diﬀeomorphisms Y0 Ñ Y1 is a torsor for the group of permutations (of, say, Y0). A connected compact 1-manifold with boundary is diﬀeomorphic to a circle or a closed interval, which immediately leads to the clas- siﬁcation of connected morphisms in Bordx0,1ypSO1q, as illustrated in Figure 4.14: every connected oriented bordism is diﬀeomorphic to one of the ﬁve illustrations. Proof. We must show that Φ is fully faithful and essentially surjective; see Proposition A.11. First, let F, G be ﬁeld theories, η1,η2 : F Ñ G isomorphisms, and suppose η1ppt`q“ η2ppt`q.Since pt´ “ pt_ `, according to the formula proved in Proposi- tion A.44 we have ηppt´q“ `ηppt`q_˘´1 for any natural isomorphism η. It follows Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 68 4. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS XeXc Figure 4.14. The ﬁve connected oriented bordisms in Bordx0,1ypSO1q that η1ppt´q“ η2ppt´q. Since any compact oriented 0-manifold Y is a ﬁnite dis- joint union of copies of pt` and pt´, it follows that η1pY q“ η2pY q for all Y , hence η1 “ η2. This shows that Φ is faithful. To show Φ is full, given F, G and an isomorphism f : F ppt`qÑ Gppt`q we must construct η : F Ñ G such that ηppt`q“ f . So deﬁne ηppt`q“ f and ηppt´q“pf _q´1. Extend using the monoidal structure in C to deﬁne ηpY q for all compact oriented 0-manifolds Y . This uses the statement given before the proof that any such Y is diﬀeomorphic to ppt`q>n` >ppt´q>n´ for unique n`,n´ P Zě0. Also, the diﬀeomorphism is determined up to permutation, but because of coherence the resulting map ηpY q is independent of the chosen diﬀeomorphism. It remains to show that η is a natural isomorphism, so to verify (A.8) for each morphism in Bord SO x0,1y. It suﬃces to consider connected bordisms, so each of the morphisms in Figure 4.14. The ﬁrst two are identity maps, for which (A.8) is trivial.

The argument for evaluation Xe is similar, and that for the circle follows since the circle is Xe˝σ˝Xc for σ the symmetry. Notice that the commutative diagram (A.8) for the circle S1 asserts F pS1q“ GpS1q. Finally, we must show that Φ is essentially surjective. Given y P C dualizable, we must48 construct a ﬁeld theory F with F ppt`q“ y.Let py_,c,eq be duality data for y. Deﬁne F ppt`q“ y, F ppt´q“ y_,and (4.50) F `ppt`q>n` >ppt´q>n´ ˘ “ ybn` bpy_qbn´ .

LECTURE 5 Extended Locality The twin pillars of quantum ﬁeld theory are locality and unitarity. In this lecture we focus on locality; we take up unitarity in Lecture 7. Axiom System 3.1 encodes a limited version of locality: the partition function and correlation func- tions in a theory F can be computed by cutting a manifold in codimension one, computing on the resulting pieces, and combining the results algebraically. The proof of Theorem 4.22 proceeds along those lines, for example. But full locality on an n-dimensional manifold requires cutting in n independent directions, and then assembling the manifold from balls. This leads to n composition laws, one for each direction of cutting, and so naturally to n-categories. When full locality in the form of extended ﬁeld theory was ﬁrst introduced [F3, La, F4] the theory of higher cate- gories was in a primitive state. By now there are many complete theories as well as detailed comparisons among them; see [BR1, BR2] and the references therein. For the purposes of these lectures we work with higher categories heuristically. Our technical results pertain to invertible ﬁeld theories, and as we will see in Lecture §6 these can be modeled using maps of spaces rather than higher categories. The notion of an extended ﬁeld theory applies to both topological and non- topological theories, though the non-topological case requires a mix of higher cate- gorical and (soft) analytical ideas that has not been fully developed. We focus here on the topological case. We give some motivation for higher categories in §5.1, with an emphasis on higher groupoids as those are most important for us. Higher categorical versions of both the domain and codomain of a ﬁeld theory are discussed in §5.2. We give some motivation and examples of extended ﬁeld theories in §5.3. Another route to extended ﬁeld theory is through extended operators—line operators, surface oper- ators, etc.—as we describe in §5.4, and in this form the idea has been in physics since the 1970s. In §5.5 we brieﬂy describe the algebra structures on the images of spheres under a ﬁeld theory. The central theorem of extended ﬁeld theory is the cobordism hypothesis, which we introduce in §5.6. Finite gauge theory in 3 dimen- sions provides an illustration of many ideas in this lecture, and we give an account in §5.7. 5.1. Higher categories Let S be a topological space. The simplest algebraic invariant we can extract from S is the set π0S of path components. Namely, deﬁne an equivalence relation— s0,s1 P S are equivalent if there exists a continuous path from s0 to s1—for which π0S is the set of equivalence classes. The next step is a categoriﬁcation. Instead of using paths as a condition, incorporate paths as data. Thus deﬁne a category πď1S whose set of objects is S and where the morphism set pπď1Sqps0,s1q is the set of 71 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 72 5. EXTENDED LOCALITY homotopy classes of paths from s0 to s1. Homotopy classes have an associative com- position law deﬁned by juxtaposing paths, and the homotopy class of the constant path at s0 is the identity for composition. Furthermore, paths are reversible. The reverse path is, up to homotopy, inverse to the original path. Therefore, πď1S is a groupoid, the fundamental groupoid of S. We can recover π0S as the set of equiva- lence classes of objects in the fundamental groupoid πď1S. The homotopy groups π1pS, sq“pπď1Sqps, sq for all basepoints s P S are also part of the data of the fundamental groupoid. γ 1 γ 0 Γ 10 Γ 10 Γ 21 Γ 21 ° Γ10 Γ ba ° Γ10 S0 S1 S0 S1 γ 2 γ 1 γ 0 Γ ba S2 γ b γ a Figure 5.1. 2 compositions of 2-morphisms Let us categorify again to incorporate π2. Thus we envision a gadget πď2S with set of objects S and for s0,s1 P S the set of 1-morphisms pπď2Sqps0,s1q is the set of paths from s0 to s1. But now there needs to be another layer of structure. Note too that there is a composition law of concatenation of paths, but it is neither associative nor unital. Both properties only hold up to homotopy, and they are witnessed by an additional layer of structure: 2-morphisms.If γ0,γ1 Ppπď2Sqps0,s1q are paths from s0 to s1, then a 2-morphism is a homotopy class of homotopies Γ10 : γ0 Ñ γ1. There are 2 composition laws on 2-morphisms, as depicted in Figure 5.1. They are associative, since 2-morphisms are homotopy classes of Γ’s, and there are units and inverses. In Figure 5.2 we depict a more symmetric view of the two composition laws. The 2-category πď2S is a 2-groupoid in the sense that all 1- and 2-morphisms are invertible up to higher morphisms. These constructions continue: for any n P Zě0 there is an n-groupoid πďnS. Remark 5.1. The sequence π0S, πď1S, πď2S,... of n-groupoids, n “ 0, 1, 2,... , is subsumed by a single 8-groupoid πď8S which has k-morphisms for all k P Zě1. It is complicated to spell out the algebraic structure—data and conditions—of an n-groupoid, much less an 8-groupoid. There is an inverse (up to homotopy) of the algebraic extraction S „„„◃ tπ0S, πď1S, πď2S,... u which from an n-groupoid G constructs a topological space |G| with πďn|G|» G. Grothendieck’s homotopy hy- pothesis states that we can pass between spaces and higher groupoids. Indeed, the simplest models for higher groupoids are based on spaces. See [L1, §1.3] for further discussion. We will use this equivalence of groupoids and spaces to pass from the general algebraic formulation of ﬁeld theories to a topological formulation in the invertible case.

Spaces no longer provide a good model. Remark 5.2. Fix nonnegative integers m, n with m ě n.An m-category in which all k-morphisms for k ě n are invertible (up to higher morphisms) is called an pm, nq-category. Allow m “8 as well. Thus an pm, 0q-category is an m-groupoid. There is an elaborate theory of p8, 1q-categories (see [L1, L2] and the references therein), and by now too a well-developed theory of p8,nq-categories for all n (see [BR1, BR2] and the references therein), with diﬀerent sorts of models and comparisons between them. We use ‘n-category’ as shorthand for ‘pn, nq-category’. Remark 5.3. There is a notion of symmetric monoidal structure for higher categories. In the case of 8-groupoids a symmetric monoidal structure corresponds to a topological space with an 8-loop space structure, as we describe in §6.6. 5.2. Examples of higher categories Example 5.4 (Higher bordism categories). The bordism 1-category Bordx1,2y has objects closed 1-manifolds and morphisms 2-dimensional bordisms between them. Introduce a Morse function t 1 : X Ñ R on a bordism with, say pt1q´1p0q the incoming boundary and pt1q´1p1q the outgoing boundary. Composition of bordisms maps to concatenation of intervals under the Morse functions; see Figure 5.3. Chopping up a 2-manifold at regular values of a single Morse function does not give a fully local picture—we should chop using a generic pair pt1,t2q of Morse functions. Then we can write a 2-manifold as a union of balls, presented as 2- manifolds with corners; see Figure 5.4. There are 2 composition laws, as in Fig- ure 5.2, the hallmark of a 2-category. The global Morse functions t 1,t2 are not part of the data 49—only near the boundaries and corners do we need these local 49In some models, e.g., [L1, §2.2], they are in fact included.

Chopping a bordism with two Morse functions “time functions” to deﬁne compositions, or, more crudely, to know what is incom- ing and outgoing for each composition law. In other terms, Bordx0,1,2y “ Bord2 is the 2-category whose objects are compact 0-manifolds; whose 1-morphisms are 1-dimensional bordisms; and whose 2-morphisms are 2-dimensional bordisms be- tween 1-dimensional bordisms, up to diﬀeomorphism. Disjoint union is deﬁned at all levels—on objects, 1-morphisms, and 2-morphisms—and endows Bord2 with a symmetric monoidal structure. See [S-P1] for details in this 2-dimensional case and [L1, CaSc] for higher dimensions. Remark 5.5. We can construct an p8, 2q-category in place of the p2, 2q-category Bord2. In that case the 2-morphisms between two 1-morphisms form the topologi- cal space of 2-dimensional bordisms between two 1-dimensional bordisms. The ﬁeld theories we consider map closed 2-manifolds to complex numbers, so any potential k-morphism, k ą 2, in the codomain higher category is the identity. Therefore, for these lectures the p2, 2q-category version of Bord2 (and so the pn, nq-category version of Bordn) suﬃces.

(Usually k “ C in applications to physical ﬁeld theories.) Let A0,A1 be k-algebras. An pA1,A0q- bimodule B is a left pA1 b Aop 0 q-module, where Aop 0 is the opposite algebra. The Morita 2-category Algk has k-algebras as objects. A 1-morphism B : A0 Ñ A1 is an pA1,A0q-bimodule B. A 2-morphism f : B Ñ B1 between 1-morphisms B, B1 : A0 Ñ A1 is a linear map f which intertwines the action of A1 b Aop 0 .The composition of 1-morphisms B10 : A0 Ñ A1 and B21 : A1 Ñ A2 is the pA2,A0q- bimodule B21 bA1 B10. The symmetric monoidal structure at all levels is tensor product over k. The tensor unit object is the ﬁeld k as a k-algebra. Exercise 5.7. Write explicitly the 2 composition laws on 2-morphisms. Example 5.8 (Z{2Z-graded algebras). The Morita 2-category Algk is a de- looping of Vectk in the sense that the category of 1-morphisms Algkpk, kq from the tensor unit to itself is isomorphic to Vectk. There is a delooping sAlgk of the cate- gory sVectk of super vector spaces (§1.4) whose objects are superalgebras—algebras in the symmetric monoidal category sVectk. 1-morphisms are Z{2Z-graded bimod- ules, and 2-morphisms are even intertwiners between Z{2Z-graded bimodules. Just as a 1-category has a maximal subgroupoid (Deﬁnition A.17), so too do higher categories. Recall Deﬁnition A.46 of a Picard 1-groupoid. For symmetric monoidal (higher) categories there is a maximal sub Picard groupoid, or underlying Picard groupoid, obtained by discarding non-invertible objects and non-invertible morphisms; see Deﬁnition A.48. For example, the Picard 1-groupoid underlying sVectk is sLinek, the groupoid whose objects are 1-dimensional Z{2Z-graded k- vector spaces and whose morphisms are invertible even maps between them. The group of isomorphism classes is Z{2Z—the grading is a complete invariant—and the automorphism group of any object is isomorphic to the units kˆ in k. The Picard 2- groupoid underlying the 2-category sAlgk has objects central simple superalgebras. Exercise 5.9. Let G be a Picard 1-groupoid. Let π0G denote the group of isomorphism classes of objects and π1G “ Gp1, 1q the automorphism group of the tensor unit. (1) Construct an isomorphism π1G Ñ Gpx, xq for all objects x P G. (2) Use the symmetry of the symmetric monoidal structure to construct a homomorphism (5.10) k : π0G b Z{2Z ÝÑ π1G. (3) Show that the triple pπ0G,π1G,kq determines G up to equivalence. (4) Compute pπ0G,π1G,kq for G “ Linek.For G “ sLinek. (You can restrict to k “ R, C.) Exercise 5.11. What is the underlying Picard groupoid of Bordn? Example 5.12 (2-category of categories). There is a 2-category Catk whose ob- jects are k-linear categories, whose 1-morphisms are linear functors between them, and whose 2-morphisms are natural transformations of functors. It is another de- looping of Vectk. Exercise 5.13. (1) Construct a functor Algk Ñ Catk. (2) Can you ﬁnd a delooping C of sVectk which receives functors sAlgk Ñ C and Catk Ñ C, both suitably “injective”?

Extended ﬁeld theories The two pillars of quantum ﬁeld theory are locality and unitarity. As explained in §5.1 the domain Bordxn´1,nypX∇ n q of an n-dimensional ﬁeld theory F (Axiom System 3.1) encodes gluing laws along codimension 1 cuts, but this is not full lo- cality. We would like to cut n times so as to decompose Wick-rotated spacetime into pieces diﬀeomorphic to balls, as in Figure 5.4. For example, cutting in codi- mension 2 allows us to formulate a local dependence of the state space attached to an pn ´ 1q-manifold Y . We remark that this level of locality is built into lat- tice models—see the tensor product (2.21) over local pieces—but is more subtle in ﬁeld theories. We do not expect such a simple tensor product over C, but rather expect data associated to Z n´2 Ă Y n´1 and a more elaborate expression of the local dependence of F pY q. Extended ﬁeld theories are much more developed in the topological case, and that is where we focus our attention. X1 X2 Y Figure 5.5. Factoring the numerical invariant F pXq We can also motivate the extended notion of a ﬁeld theory as a factorization of invariants. Let (5.14) F :Bordxn´1,nypXnqÑ Vectk be a topological ﬁeld theory with values in the symmetric monoidal category of vector spaces over k. Thus the theory assigns a number in k to every closed n- manifold X (with Xn-structure, which we do not mention in the sequel). Sup- pose X is cut in two by a codimension one submanifold Y , asindicatedinFig- ure 5.5. View X1 : ∅n´1 Ñ Y and X2 : Y Ñ ∅n´1,so that F pX1q : k Ñ F pY q and F pX2q : F pY qÑ k.Let ξ1,...,ξk be a basis of F pY q and ξ1,... ,ξk the dual basis of the dual vector space F pY q_.Write (5.15) F pX1q“ aiξi F pX2q“ biξi for some ai,bi P k. Then the fact that F pXq“ F pX2q˝ F pX1q means (5.16) F pXq“ aibi. In other words, the ﬁeld theory allows us to factorize the numerical invariant of a closed n-manifold into a sum of products of numbers. An n-manifold with boundary has an invariant which is not a single number, but rather a vector of numbers. We ask: Can we factor the vector space F pY q? If so, what kind of equation replaces (5.16)? Well, it must be an equation of sets rather than numbers, and more precisely an equation for vector spaces. Our experience teaches us we should not write an equality but rather an isomorphism, and that isomorphism takes place in the category Vectk.(Compare: the equation (5.16) takes place in the set k.)

But what are ci,ci? By analogy they should be dual bases of a Vectk-module F pZq which is associated to the closed pn ´ 2q- manifold Z. Of course, the ﬁeld theory (5.14) does not assign anything in codimen- sion 2, so we must extend our notion of ﬁeld theory to carry out this factorization. Remark 5.19. There is no canonical choice for the codomain symmetric monoi- dal n-category C of an extended n-dimensional ﬁeld theory. There are physics- inspired desiderata. At the “top two levels” C should reduce to VectC,or bet- ter sVectC. To wit, there is a tensor unit object 10, a tensor unit 1-morphism 11 : 10 Ñ 10, a tensor unit 2-morphism 12 : 11 Ñ 11, etc., and the “top two levels” of a symmetric monoidal n-category form the 1-category of endomorphisms of 1n´2. Also, the complex linearity—which derives from interference and superposition in quantum mechanics—should continue to all levels. Finally, we have a highly evi- denced candidate Σ nICˆ for the underlying Picard groupoid of C;see §6.8. Remark 5.20. The expressions in (5.16) and (5.17) only make sense if the linear category F pZq is semisimple. This holds in elementary examples, but there are many derived situations of interest in which this reasoning is far too naive. We oﬀer it here only as motivation for Axiom 5.21. By contrast, the domain of an extended ﬁeld theory is unambiguous: it is the bordism n-category described in Example 5.4. Since we restrict to topological theories, we can encode the background ﬁelds as a ﬂabby tangential structure Xn Ñ BGLn R; see Deﬁnition 1.40. Axiom System 5.21. Fix a symmetric monoidal n-category C.An extended n- dimensional topological ﬁeld theory on Xn-manifolds with values in C is a symmetric monoidal functor (5.22) F :BordnpXnqÝÑ C. See [F3, La, F4] for early versions of extended topological ﬁeld theories and [L1, AF, CS] for modern treatments.

We should incorporate into the axioms evaluation of the theory on smooth families of manifolds, as we saw in a non-topological theory (Exam- ple 2.46). In the topological case we can and should promote Axiom 5.21 from pn, nq-categories to p8,nq-categories, where the higher morphisms in BordnpXnq are diﬀeomorphisms, isotopies, isotopies of isotopies, etc.; see [L1, §1.4]. Some discrete examples factor down to a map of pn, nq-categories, but many interesting examples, such as those coming from geometric representation theory, for exam- ple [BGN], do not. Example 5.24. Fix a ﬁnite group G and consider the n “ 2 ﬁnite gauge theory FG :Bordx1,2y Ñ VectC discussed in Example 1.23. Extend to (5.25) pFG :Bord2 ÝÑ CatC. The 1-category pFGpptq can be computed by a “ﬁnite path integral” which linearizes the groupoid BunGpptq»˚{{G;see [FHLT, §3]. We obtain the linear category50 pFGpptq“ RepCpGq of ﬁnite dimensional complex representations of G. Alterna- tively, we can consider the codomain 2-category C “ AlgC, in which case the ﬁnite path integral computes the group algebra pFGpptq“ CrGs with its convolution product. Exercise 5.26. For pFG :Bord2 Ñ AlgC compute pFGpS1q from pFGpptq.Hint: Express S1 as the composition e˝σ˝c of the duality data evaluation and coevaluation associated with pt and the symmetry σ. Exercise 5.27. The 2-dimensional Arf theory of spin manifolds (Example 1.59) has an extension pF with codomain C “ sAlgC; in fact, it factors through the un- derlying Picard subgroupoid of central simple algebras. Suppose the value pF ppt`q of pF on the positively oriented point is the complex Cliﬀord algebra Cliﬀ C 1 on a single generator. Compute as in Exercise 5.26 that pF pS1q is an odd line. There is a beautiful application of the extended Arf theory to spin Hurwitz numbers [Gu]. 5.4. Extended operators Extended locality has been around in quantum ﬁeld theory for a long time in the form of extended operators. The line operators of Wilson [Wi]and ’t Hooft [tH] in gauge theories are typical examples. Kapustin [Ka1] explained the relationship between extended operators and Axiom System 5.21. We give a brief account here. The ideas pertain to all ﬁeld theories, but we focus on the topological case. First, in an n-dimensional topological ﬁeld theory F the vector space of ob- servables,or point operators,at x P X is F `Sϵpxq˘ , the value of the theory on the linking sphere of x P X for small radius ϵ. The precise value of ϵ ą 0suf- ﬁciently small is irrelevant in a topological theory. Note F `Sϵpxq˘ – F pSn´1q, but not canonically. To view elements of F pSn´1q– F `Sϵpxq˘ as point operators we imagine ϵ small, as in (3.3). At the other extreme, for large spheres elements of F pSn´1q– F `Sϵpxq˘ may be viewed as states in the theory on Sn´1.In a topological—or more generally a conformal—ﬁeld theory the state-operator corre- spondence expresses the isomorphism between the vector space of states and the 50Although RepCpGq has a (symmetric) monoidal structure, it is not used here.

Correlation functions on X n closed are computed at x1,... ,xk P X using the bordism (5.28) pXϵ “ X z kď n“1 Bϵpxiq : kž i“1 SϵpxiqÝÑ ∅ n´1 for suﬃciently small ϵ. Remark 5.29 (Vector spaces of point operators). If the theory has Wick- rotated symmetry type pHn,ρnq, then the sphere has an Hn-structure and the vector space of point operators depends on it. If Hn “ SOn ˆK or Hn “ On ˆK, the extra data is a principal K-bundle Q Ñ Sn´1 (with connection). So there is a vector space VQ of point operators for each Q. The group Aut Q of global gauge transformations acts on VQ. For the trivial K-bundle this is the representation of the global symmetry group K on local operators. If K is ﬁnite, then the “twist operators” in an n “ 2 dimensional theory evaluated on nontrivial principal K- bundles Q Ñ S1 are familiar, for example in string theory. They are also familiar when H2 “ Spin2, in which case the operators associated to the nonbounding spin circle create a defect at the excised point which changes the spin structure on the punctured surface. In 3 dimensions, if H3 is a Cartesian product as above and K “ T, then the twist operators in some sense create a magnetically charged in- stanton for the global symmetry group T;the Z-grading from the action of T on the point operators measures the electric charge. Now instead of a point x P X we consider a connected 1-dimensional subman- ifold L Ă X. We could again cut out a tubular neighborhood of L, and the vector space attached to the boundary—the total space of the sphere bundle SϵpνLqÑ L of the normal bundle to L—is the space of operators one can insert in a neighbor- hood of L. But extended locality tells that F `SϵpνLq˘ depends locally on points of L. Namely, for each x P L there is an associated invariant F `SϵpνLqx˘ of the Sn´1 link to L at x: the unit sphere in the normal space. For typical codomains C this invariant is a 1-category or algebra. In a non-topological theory we would take ϵ Ñ 0, but in a topological theory this is unnecessary. All F `SϵpνLqx˘ are isomorphic to F pSn´2q, but not canonically. In any case F pSn´2q is often called the category of line operators in the theory. We can also interpret a 1-dimensional submanifold L Ă X as the Wick rotated version of the worldline of a particle. In that interpretation F pSn´2q is the linear 1-category of particles in the theory. If a, b, c are objects in that category, then the vector space of morphisms a b b Ñ c parametrizes fusion processes. (The parallel statement for 0-dimensional submanifolds is that a point x P X is the Wick-rotated version of an instanton.) The story continues to higher dimensional submanifolds in X, with higher categorical objects attached to their links. An pn´1q-dimensional submanifold W Ă X is called a domain wall ; the link is diﬀeomorphic to S0 and F pS0q parametrizes endomorphisms of the theory F . More generally, we can have two theories F0,F1 on the two sides of the domain wall and a map 51 F0 Ñ F1 on the domain wall. 51More precisely, a map of the truncations τďn´1F0 Ñ τďn´1F1 to pn ´ 1q-dimensional theories. Recall (Lemma 4.44) that a map as n-dimensional theories is necessarily invertible, and we want to allow non-invertible domain walls.

EXTENDED LOCALITY If X is a manifold with boundary, then the link of BX Ă X is a single point and F pptq is interpreted as the collection of boundary conditions for F . 5.5. Algebra structures on spheres ≅≅ Figure 5.7. The algebra structure on S0 To begin consider S0 as an object in Bord1. The bordism X : S0 > S0 Ñ S0 depicted on the left of Figure 5.7 deﬁnes an algebra structure on S0. The associa- tivity and unit axioms are illustrated as well. Similarly, the object S1 in Bordx1,2y is a commutative algebra object; commutativity of multiplication is depicted as the braiding β in Figure 5.8. The images of S0 and S1 under a symmetric monoidal functor are also (commutative) algebra objects. We used the commutative algebra structure on S1 in §4.2; see Figure 4.5. Figure 5.8. The algebra structure on S1 There is an algebra structure on Sn´1 in Bordxn´1,ny; multiplication is the bor- dism DnzpDn >Dnq, a closed ball with two smaller balls removed. It is commutative if n ě 2. Proposition 5.30. Let F :Bordxn´1,ny Ñ VectC be a topological ﬁeld theory. Then F pSn´1q is an algebra, commutative if n ě 2. Remark 5.31. In theories with Xn-structure, let the classifying map of TDn Ñ Dn be the constant map Dn Ñ BOn to the basepoint, and the Xn-structure the constant map Dn Ñ Xn. This induces an Xn-structure on the boundary Sn´1 and, with that Xn-structure, Sn´1 is again an algebra. Remark 5.32. This algebra structure on the vector space of observables of a topological ﬁeld theory has an analog in a non-topological theory: the operator product expansion [Wei1, Chapter 20]. It is a basic piece of structure in quantum ﬁeld theory. In an extended n-dimensional ﬁeld theory pF there are algebra structures on spheres of all dimensions ď n ´ 1, and so too on their images under pF .In this higher categorical context there are ﬁner gradations of commutativity. For example, Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 5. EXTENDED LOCALITY 81 suppose C is a monoidal 1-category with multiplication functor μ : C ˆ C Ñ C.A braiding is a natural transformation β : μ ˝ τ Ñ μ,where τ : C ˆ C Ñ C ˆ C is transposition. The braiding data satisﬁes some conditions we do not spell out here; see [JS]. The existence of a braiding is an expression of commutativity, but there is a stronger form, namely the requirement that the square of the braiding be the identity. Hence the distinction between braided monoidal categories and symmetric monoidal categories.In an n-dimensional extended topological ﬁeld theory F pSn´2q is braided commutative if n “ 3 and symmetric commutative if n ě 4. (See [F4] for additional features of the n “ 3case.) There is a general framework—operads—in which to measure the level of com- mutativity [MSS]. In that framework Sk´1 is an Ek-algebra, hence so is its image under a symmetric monoidal functor. Remark 5.33. Versions of these algebra structures show up in non-topological ﬁeld theories, as in Remark 5.32, but now on line operators, surface operators, etc., and there are sometimes more subtle operations as well; see [Ka1, BBBDN]. 5.6. Cobordism hypothesis Baez-Dolan [BD] recognized the importance of duality and dualizability in topological ﬁeld theories. Recall (Deﬁnition A.28) that a dualizable object x P C in a symmetric monoidal category behaves as a ﬁnite dimensional vector space: dual- izability is a ﬁniteness condition. Every object in a bordism category is dualizable, so too is its image under a ﬁeld theory; see Lemma 1.20 and Corollary 1.21. There is a higher notion of dualizability in a higher category [L1, §2.3]. Objects in BordnpXnq are fully dualizable in this sense. The cobordism hypothesis asserts that a fully extended topological ﬁeld theory is determined by its value on a point, and any fully dualizable object in the codomain n-category C can occur. We proved the discrete 1-dimensional version, Theorem 4.46, in §4.4. The cobordism hypothe- sis does more; it identiﬁes the homotopy type of the space of theories on manifolds with Xn-structure and a ﬁxed codomain C. The theorem works for theories with values in p8,nq-categories. Use the same notation as in Theorem 4.46, but now pC fdq„ is the 8-groupoid underlying the subcategory of fully dualizable objects in C. The simplest case has domain n-framed manifolds (Example 1.42), and that is the version we state. Theorem 5.34 (Cobordism hypothesis). Let C be a symmetric monoidal p8,nq-category. Then the map (5.35) Φ: TFT(n-framedq n pCqÝÑpC fdq„ F ÞÝÑ F ppt`q is an equivalence of p8,nq-groupoids. The cobordism hypothesis was conjectured by Baez-Dolan [BD], proved by Hopkins-Lurie in the 2-dimensional case, and then by Lurie [L1] in general; see [Te1, F5] for expositions. Ayala-Francis [AF] are developing a proof using factorization homology. There are many powerful applications of the cobordism hypothesis; for some applications in geometric representation theory see [BN, BGN]. In a diﬀerent di- rection, the cobordism hypothesis promises to be a powerful tool for classiﬁcation Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 82 5. EXTENDED LOCALITY problems (of non-invertible theories) in condensed matter physics. In these lectures we eventually focus on invertible theories, and as we explain in Lecture 6 we work with inﬁnite loop spaces in place of symmetric monoidal higher categories. In the invertible case the cobordism hypothesis reduces [L1, §2.5] to Theorem 6.67, a key ingredient in our story which can be proved using techniques of stable homotopy theory. 5.7. Extended example Let G be a ﬁnite group. Recall from Example 1.23 the associated 3-dimensional gauge theory (5.36) GG :Bordx2,3y ÝÑ VectC which sums the tensor unit theory over the groupoid BunG of principal G-bundles. There is an extension [F3, FHLT] of this ﬁnite path integral construction to obtain an extended topological ﬁeld theory. We tell some of its features here; see [FT2, §3] and the references therein for a recent account with more details. This theory is the simplest example of 3-dimensional quantum Chern-Simons ﬁeld theory [W6, DW]. The ﬁrst decision we make is a choice of codomain symmetric monoidal 3- category C. A convenient choice is C “ TensCatC, the 3-category whose objects are complex linear tensor categories T. A 1-morphism T Ñ T1 is an pT1, Tq-bimodule category, a 2-morphism is a linear functor which commutes with the tensor category actions, and a 3-morphism is a natural transformation of functors. See [EGNO, DSPS] for detailed developments of TensCatC as a 3-category. Extended ﬁnite gauge theory is a symmetric monoidal functor (5.37) pGG :Bord3 ÝÑ TensCatC . Its value on a point, computed as the (co)limit52 of the constant functor BunGpptq“ ˚{{G Ñ TensCatC with value the tensor unit VectC,is (5.38) pGGpptq“ VectCrGs, the tensor category of ﬁnite rank complex vector bundles over G with convolution product: if W, W 1 Ñ G are vector bundles, then (5.39) pW ˚ W 1qh “ à gg1“h Wg b W 1 g1 ,h P G; the convolution product of morphisms is deﬁned similarly. One may regard VectCrGs as the “group ring” of G with coeﬃcients in VectC.See [FHLT, Example 3.6] for the analogous 2-categorical (co)limit. Since the circle S1 : H0 ÑH0 is a 1- morphism from the tensor unit (empty 0-manifold) to itself, pGGpS1q is a complex linear category. It is computed by summing over BunGpS1q« G{{G: (5.40) pGGpS1q“ VectGpGq is the linear category of complex vector bundles over the groupoid BunGpS1q« G{{G, i.e., the category of G-equivariant vector bundles over G.The values of pGG on 2- and 3-manifolds agree with those of GG, as computed in (1.26) and (1.29). 52In the ﬁnite path integral construction colimits and limits are equivalent, a property called ambidexterity [HL]. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 5. EXTENDED LOCALITY 83 Exercise 5.41. Construct an extension of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory (Exam- ple 1.44) to a theory with domain the 3-category Bord3pGL` 3 Rq. The category of line operators in 3-dimensional ﬁnite gauge theory is pGGpS1q« VectGpGq;see §5.4. There are subcategories of Wilson and ’t Hooft operators, and these have a classical gauge-theoretic description. The Wilson operator is deﬁned for S Ă X an oriented connected 1-dimensional submanifold of a closed 3-manifold X together with χ : G Ñ T a character of G. Then the function (5.42) hS,χ :BunGpXqÝÑ C maps a principal G-bundle P Ñ X to χ applied to the holonomy.53 The ﬁnite path integral (1.29) with Wilson operator pS, χqW inserted is (5.43) GG`X; pS, χqW ˘ “ ÿ rP sPπ0 BunGpXq hS,χpP q #Aut P . Remark 5.44. Since pGG is a theory of unoriented manifolds, we should not need an orientation on S to deﬁne the loop operator. Indeed, we can drop the orientation and replace χ by a function from orientations of S to characters of G which inverts the character when the orientation is reversed. The ’t Hooft operator is deﬁned for S Ă X a co-oriented connected 1-dimensional submanifold and γ Ă G a conjugacy class. Deﬁne the groupoid BunG`X; pS, γq˘ whose objects are principal G-bundles P Ñ XzS with holonomy γ around an oriented linking curve to S. The ﬁnite path integral (1.29) with ’t Hooft operator pS, γqH inserted is (5.45) GG`X; pS, γqH˘ “ ÿ rP sPπ0 BunGpX;pS,γqq 1 #Aut P . As in Remark 5.44 we can drop the co-orientation and replace γ by a function from co-orientations to conjugacy classes which inverts under co-orientation reversal. The Wilson loop operators form the full subcategory of equivariant vector bundles supported at the identity e P G, which is equivalent to the category RepCpGq of ﬁnite dimensional complex representations of G. The ’t Hooft operators form the full subcategory of equivariant vector bundles on which the centralizer ZxpGq of each x P G acts trivially on the ﬁber at x. The general loop operator is an amalgam of these two extremes and does not have a classical description. Remark 5.46. Let pF be an n-dimensional extended topological ﬁeld theory and S Ă X a connected 1-dimensional submanifold of an n-manifold X. The link of S at each point is diﬀeomorphic to Sn´2, but there is no preferred diﬀeomor- phism. Furthermore, the group of diﬀeomorphisms of Sn´2 may act nontrivially on pF pSn´2q. Therefore, to specify a loop operator on S it is not suﬃcient54 to give an object of pF pSn´2q. For ﬁnite gauge theory pGG the objects in pGGpS1q correspond- ing to Wilson and ’t Hooft operators are SO2-invariant, so no normal framing is required. 53The holonomy is determined up to conjugacy and χ is a class function. 54For example, typically in 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory [W6] one imposes a normal framing of S to rigidify the SO2-action (Dehn twist, ribbon structure) on pF pS1q.

Then the conjugation action of A on A is trivial, and we identify (5.47) VectApAq» VectpA ˆ A_q by decomposing the representation of A on each ﬁber. Wilson operators are labeled by vector bundles pulled back under the projection AˆA_ Ñ A_; ’t Hooft operators by vector bundles pulled back under the projection A ˆ A_ Ñ A. There is another extended 3-dimensional topological ﬁeld theory (5.48) pRG :Bord3 ÝÑ TensCatC deﬁned using the cobordism hypothesis by declaring that the value (5.49) pRGpptq“ RepCpGq on a point is the tensor category of ﬁnite dimensional complex representations of G. Remark 5.50. If G is nonabelian we do not know of a “classical model” for pRG. Also, to obtain a theory on general manifolds, as opposed to framed manifolds, we must specify “GL3R-equivariance data”; see [FT2, §3.2]. The tensor cate- gories tVectrGs and RepCpGq are isomorphic objects of TensCatC, i.e., are Morita equivalent. This leads to an equivalence of extended ﬁeld theories pGG « pRG by another application of the cobordism hypothesis. (The Morita equivalence only preserves GL` 3 R-equivariance data, not GL3-equivariance data, so the equivalence of ﬁeld theories only holds after pullback via Bord3pGL` 3 RqÑ Bord3.) If G “ A is abelian, then there is a Pontrjagin dual group A_ “ HompA, Cˆq and pRA « pGA_ is also a ﬁnite gauge theory. In that case the equivalence pGA « pGA_ is a ﬁnite group version of electromagnetic duality. For example, if Y is a closed oriented surface, then the isomorphism (5.51) pGA_ pY q“ Fun`H 1pY ; Aq˘ – ÝÝÝÑ Fun`H 1pY ; A_q˘ “ pGA_ pY q is the Fourier transform between functions on Pontrjagin dual groups. Electro- magnetic duality exchanges A and A_ in (5.47), so exchanges Wilson and ’t Hooft operators.

LECTURE 6 Invertibility and Stable Homotopy Theory The link between invertible ﬁeld theories and stable homotopy theory was in- troduced in [FHT]. The basic idea is simple: if M Ñ N is a homomorphism of commutative monoids which factors through the abelian group of units N ˆ Ă N , then there is an induced homomorphism of abelian groups |M |Ñ N ˆ,where |M | is the group completion of M . For ﬁeld theory we use a categoriﬁed variant: an in- vertible ﬁeld theory factors through a map of (higher) Picard groupoids, and the geometric realization of a Picard groupoid is an inﬁnite loop space, the 0-space of a spectrum. Therefore, we model invertible ﬁeld theories as maps of spectra.The issue is to identify the spectra, a task we carry out for topological ﬁeld theories. The domain spectrum is the geometric realization of a higher bordism category (Example 5.4), and this is known to be a Madsen-Tillmann spectrum. For the codomain we need more input, because in the non-invertible case there is no canon- ical codomain to use as a starting point. In the invertible case there is a universal choice—the character dual IC ˆ to the sphere spectrum—which we motivate by asking that the partition function determine the entire theory. But then there is magic, revealed at the end of §6.8, which makes that choice work even better than we may have expected. We deﬁne invertible topological ﬁeld theories as maps of spectra in Ansatz 6.89, though in principle it should be a theorem derived from Axiom System 5.21 and some input about the codomain. Once we formulate in- vertible topological ﬁeld theories as maps of spectra, we can identify the abelian group of deformation classes, which we do in §6.9, again formally as a deﬁnition. Passing to deformation classes naturally brings in new invertible theories, as we ex- plain in §6.10. There we model the deformation class as a “continuous” invertible theory, a notion which does not generalize to the non-invertible case. The frame- work developed in this lecture incorporates strong locality of extended ﬁeld theory. However, it does not include unitarity, which is essential for applications to physics and which we take up in the next two lectures. We begin in §6.1 with the groupoid completion of a category, which we compute explicitly in §6.3 for the 1-dimensional bordism category. We deﬁne invertible ﬁeld theories and give examples in §6.2. In the non-extended case there are simple Morse theory arguments to illustrate the connection between invertible topological ﬁeld theories and bordism, as we explain in §6.4. Then, after some comments about spectra in §6.5, we give a detailed description of Madsen-Tillmann and Thom spectra in §6.6. The character and Anderson duals to the sphere spectrum, with motivation from algebra, are introduced in §6.7. Extended invertible ﬁeld theories and deformation classes are discussed in §6.8–§6.10. 85 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 86 6. INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 6.1. Categorical preliminaries Definition 6.1. Let C be a category. A groupoid completion p|C|,iq of C is agroupoid |C| and a functor i : C Ñ|C| which satisﬁes the following universal property: If G is a groupoid and f : C Ñ G a functor, then there exists a unique groupoid map ˜f : |C|Ñ G which makes the diagram (6.2) C i \u0004\u0004 f \r\r\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f |C| ˜f \r \r \r \r G commute. Intuitively, |C| is obtained from C by “inverting all of the arrows”, much in the same way that the group completion of a monoid is constructed. There is a choice whether to require that ˜f in (6.2) be unique; we make that choice. Then p|C|,iq is unique up to unique isomorphism, and the map i is an isomorphism i0 : C0 Ñ|C|0 on objects. As for existence, one approach is to use the geometric realization of the category C and let |C| be its fundamental groupoid. Exercise 6.3. (1) Let M be a monoid. Write the universal property for a group completion i : M Ñ|M | and prove existence and uniqueness. (2) Let C be a (small) category with C0,C1 the sets of objects and mor- phisms, respectively. Generate a free groupoid by formally introducing inverse arrows—another copy of C, with source and target maps swapped. Then construct a groupoid completion as the quotient by the relation that compositions in C equal formal compositions in the free groupoid. (3) If C is symmetric monoidal, induce a symmetric monoidal structure on |C|. If every object in C is dualizable, show that |C| is a Picard groupoid. Remark 6.4. One can also deﬁne the groupoid completion of an p8,nq-cate- gory; see [L1, Remark 2.5.5]. 6.2. Invertible ﬁeld theories We work with extended topological ﬁeld theories, but emphasize that the notion of an invertible ﬁeld theory works in the non-topological case as well. Invertible ﬁeld theories were introduced in [FM2] in the context of M-theory for non-extended topological ﬁeld theories. Definition 6.5. Fix a nonnegative integer n, a ﬂabby tangential structure Xn, and a symmetric monoidal p8,nq-category C. Then a topological quantum ﬁeld theory α :BordnpXnqÑ C is invertible if it factors through the underlying Picard Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 6. INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 87 groupoid 55 of C: (6.6) BordnpXnq α \u0004\u0004 \u000e\u000e\u000e \u000e \u000e \u000e \u000e C C ˆ \u000f\u000f\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r If α is invertible, it follows from the universal property of the groupoid completion (Deﬁnition 6.1, but now extended to p8,nq-categories) that there is a factorization (6.7) BordnpXnq α \u0004\u0004 \u0005\u0005 C | BordnpXnq| ˜α \u0004\u0004 C ˆ \u000b\u000b We identify the invertible theory with the map ˜α (and usually omit the tilde.) Remark 6.8. The groupoid completion | BordnpXnq| of a bordism category is a Picard groupoid, since every object of BordnpXnq is dualizable (Lemma 1.20). Exercise 6.9. A topological ﬁeld theory α is invertible if and only if it is an invertible object in the symmetric monoidal category of topological ﬁeld theories. Example 6.10. We invite the reader to check that several of the theories we have already introduced are invertible, though not always extended. These include “classical” theories such as the classical Dijkgraaf-Witten theory (Example 1.50); theories of characteristic numbers (Example 1.52), including the Euler theory; the 2-dimensional Arf theory (Example 1.59); and the (non-topological) 1-dimensional theory of parallel transport (Example 2.46). Example 6.11. According to Theorem 4.46 to deﬁne an oriented 1-dimensional TQFT (6.12) α :Bordx0,1ypSO1qÑ sVectk we need only specify αppt`q, which we take to be the odd k-line. It follows easily that αpS1q“ ´1. Example 6.13 (Euler theory). It is easy to fully extend the n-dimensional Euler theory ϵμ in (1.53). Since the vector space in codimension 1 is always the tensor unit, we can extend the theory to higher codimensions by mapping every k-morphism, k ă n, to the tensor unit. Hence the truncation (6.14) τďn´1ϵμ :Bordn´1 ÝÑ τďn´1C is the trivial theory—the tensor unit theory—with codomain the truncation of C that drops non-invertible n-morphisms. A more down-to-earth explanation: any compact n-manifold, with or without boundary, has an Euler number, so the line attached to the boundary pn ´ 1q- manifold is the complex line C. (The exponentiated Euler number takes values in 55See §A.4 for the underlying groupoid in the 1-categorical case. For a non-extended ﬁeld theory the codomain 1-category is typically a category of topological complex vector spaces; the underlying groupoid is the groupoid LineC of complex lines and invertible linear maps.

INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY this line.) The truncated theory which assigns the trivial line to every closed pn´1q- manifold fully extends to the tensor unit theory no matter what the codomain category. By contrast, for other invariants, such as the classical Dijkgraaf-Witten invariant with nonzero cocycle (Example 1.50), the value on a compact n-manifold with boundary is not a number, but rather an element of a nontrivial complex line. Example 6.15 (Kervaire theory). Assume that n “ 4ℓ`1. The Kervaire semi- characteristic [Ke, LMP] of a closed orientable n-manifold X is the mod 2 sum of the even Betti numbers. It is a KO-characteristic number [AS1, §3]. Analogous to Example 1.52 there is an invertible ﬁeld theory of oriented bordisms (6.16) κ :Bordxn´1,nypSOnqÝÑ sVectC whose partition function is ´1 to the power of the Kervaire semi-characteristic. Note κpSnq“´1. The case n “ 1 is the theory in Example 6.11. Example 6.17. There is a nontrivial invertible theory [FKS, §5] of spin 3- manifolds X equipped with a map φ : X Ñ S2. It is a theory of order 2 which restricted to X “ S3 gives the mod 2 Hopf invariant of φ. The partition function has a geometric description. Fix a regular value p P S2 of φ : X Ñ S2, and ﬁx a basis e1,e2 of TpS2. This produces a normal framing of the 1-manifold S :“ φ´1ppq,and so a stable normal framing. The partition function is ´1 to the power the class of the stably normally framed manifold S in the framed bordism group Ωframed 1 – Z{2Z. Exercise 6.18. (1) For X “ S3 prove that this gives the mod 2 Hopf invariant. (2) Construct the non-extended theory explicitly and geometrically. Remark 6.19. The input to the Feynman path integral on a closed n-manifold is the exponentiated classical action e iS of a classical ﬁeld theory. The locality properties are summarized by the requirement that e iS be the partition function of an extended invertible ﬁeld theory. 6.3. Geometric realization of 1-dimensional bordism It is illuminating to compute the groupoid completion (Deﬁnition 6.1) explicitly for the discrete 1-category Bordx0,1ypSO1q. Note that an orientation of a 1-manifold is equivalent to a 1-framing. Theorem 6.20. The groupoid completion of the oriented bordism category has (6.21) π0| Bord1pSO1q| – Z,π1| Bord1pSO1q| – Z{2Z, with nontrivial k-invariant. Proof. The argument for π0 is straightforward and amounts to the assertion ΩSO 0 – Z. Set B “ Bord1pSO1q. To compute π1B we argue as follows. First, 1B “ ∅ 0 is the empty 0-manifold, so Endp1Bq“ Bp1B, 1Bq consists of diﬀeomorphism classes of closed oriented 1-manifolds. By the classiﬁcation of 1-manifolds there is an isomorphism of commutative monoids Endp1Bq– Zě0 which counts the number of (circle) components of a bordism X.Let Xn denote the disjoint union of n oriented Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 6.

Note that the circle has a unique orientation up to orientation-preserving diﬀeomorphism. Then using the bordisms deﬁned in Figure 6.1 we have (6.22) f1 ˝ g “ f2 ˝ g “ h as morphisms in B. In the groupoid completion |B| we can compose on the right with the inverse to ipgq to conclude that ipf1q“ ipf2q,where i : B Ñ|B|.That implies that in |B| we have (6.23) ipf1q˝ ipkq“ ipf2q˝ ipkq, hence ipX4q“ ipX2q. Cancel to conclude ipX2q“ ip∅0q“ 1|B|. To rule out the possibility that ipX1q is also the tensor unit, use the invertible topological ﬁeld theory in Example 6.11. It maps the oriented circle X1 toanon-tensor unit(which necessarily has order two). It remains to show that every morphism ∅ 0 Ñ ∅ 0 in |B| is equivalent to a union of circles and their formal inverses. Observe ﬁrst that the inverse of the “right elbow” is the “left elbow” union a circle, since their composition in one order is ipX2q, which is equivalent to the identity map. Next, any morphism ∅0 Ñ ∅ 0 in |B| is the composition of a ﬁnite number of morphisms Y2k Ñ Y2ℓ and inverses of such morphisms, where Yn is the 0-manifold consisting of n points. Furthermore, each such morphism is the disjoint union of circles, identities, right elbows, left elbows, and their inverses. Identities are self-inverse and the elbows are each others inverse, up to a circle, hence carrying out the compositions of elbows and identities we obtain a union of circles and their inverses, as desired.−−−−++++ Figure 6.2.

Non-extended invertible ﬁeld theories and Reinhart bordism Theorem 6.27 below is a ﬁrst indication of the relationship between invertible topological ﬁeld theories and bordism invariants. We ﬁrst introduce an unstable notion of bordism. Definition 6.24. Let X be a closed n-manifold. Then X is (Reinhart) null bordant if there exists a compact pn ` 1q-manifold W with BW “ X and a rank n vector bundle E Ñ W together with an isomorphism TW – ÝÝÑ R ‘ E whose restric- tion to BW is the direct sum ν ‘ TX – ÝÝÑ R ‘ E ˇ ˇ X of an outward trivialization of the normal bundle ν Ñ X to the boundary and an isomorphism of TX with E ˇ ˇ X . Remark 6.25. The original deﬁnition of Reinhart [Re] for oriented and unori- ented manifolds is equivalent; our formulation works for arbitrary tangential struc- tures. See [E, Appendix] for the relationship of Deﬁnition 6.24 to Madsen-Tillmann spectra. If X is Reinhart null bordant, then X is Thom null bordant (Deﬁnition 1.1), but the converse is not true. Use Deﬁnition 6.24 to deﬁne56 an equivalence relation and Reinhart bordism groups Ω R n . We can incorporate an n-dimensional ﬂabby tangential structure Xn Ñ BGLn R, and so deﬁne ΩR n pXnq. Exercise 6.26. (1) If n is even prove that Sn is Thom null bordant but not Reinhart null bordant. (2) Fix an even positive integer n.Prove that for any μ P Cˆ,the map X ÞÑ μEulerpXq is an unoriented Reinhart bordism invariant. (3) If n ” 1 pmod 4q prove that Sn has order 2 in Ω R n pSOnq.If n ” 3 pmod 4q prove that Sn is oriented Reinhart null bordant. (4) If n ” 1 pmod 4q prove that the Kervaire semicharacteristic (Example 6.15) is an oriented Reinhart bordism invariant. Theﬁrstpartofthe following theorem is[FM2, Proposition 5.8]. Recall the Euler theory ϵμ (1.53) and the Kervaire theory κ (Example 6.15). Theorem 6.27. Let α :Bordxn´1,nypSOnqÑ sVectC be an invertible (non- extended) ﬁeld theory.

INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 91 (2) For all α the partition function is a Reinhart bordism invariant ΩR n pSOnqÝÑ Cˆ. Proof. First, we study the behavior of α under Morse surgery. Fix r P Z, 0 ď r ď n,and set (6.29) H 1 r “ Dr ˆ Sn´r H 2 r “ Sr´1 ˆ Dn´r`1. Orient spheres using the boundary orientation induced from the closed ball, orient H 1 r,H 2 r (r odd) with the product orientation, and orient H 2 r (r even) oppositely to the product orientation; then H 1 r,H 2 r induce the same orientation on Sr´1 ˆ Sn´r. View H 1 r,H 2 r as bordisms with outgoing boundary and write 57 (6.30) αpH 2 r q“ λr αpH 1 rqP αpSr´1 ˆ Sn´rq for λr P Cˆ.Set r “ n ` 1 to deduce (6.31) a :“ αpSnq“ λn`1. Let pH 1 r, pH 2 r be the manifolds (6.29) as bordisms with incoming boundary and op- posite orientation. Then there are diﬀeomorphisms (isomorphisms in the bordism category) (6.32) pH 1 r ˝ H 2 r – pH 2 r ˝ H 1 r – Sn pH 1 r ˝ H 1 r – Sr ˆ Sn´r pH 2 r ˝ H 2 r – Sr´1 ˆ Sn´r`1 Let νr “ αpSr ˆ Sn´rq. Deduce from (6.30), (6.31), and (6.32) that (6.33) a “ λrνr “ λ´1 r νr´1, Now ν1 “ 1, as follows from footnote 57, from which we conclude (6.34) λr “ # a´1,r even, a, r odd; and νr “ # a2,r even, 1,r odd. Recall that Morse surgery is an elementary bordism of the form (6.35) WrpX 1q : H 1 r YSr´1ˆSn´r X 1 ÝÑ H 2 r YSr´1ˆSn´r X 1 for some compact n-manifold X 1 with boundary; WrpX 1q is the trace of the surgery with incoming patient the domain manifold and outgoing patient the codomain manifold. Now to the assertions in the theorem. For (1) we have a “ 1and must show that if X is a closed oriented n-manifold, then αpXq is unchanged by Morse surgery (6.35), i.e., λr “ 1 for all r. That follows immediately from (6.34). For (2) if n is even set α1 “ α¨ϵμ,where μ is chosen so that μ´2 “ αpSnq and ϵμ is the Euler theory (1.53). Then α1 satisﬁes the hypothesis of (1), so its partition function is a Thom bordism invariant. It now follows from Exercise 6.26(2) that α is a Reinhart bordism invariant. If n is odd, then a closed n-manifold X is oriented Reinhart null bordant if and only if it bounds a compact pn ` 1q-manifold W of even Euler 57If a closed oriented pn ´ 1q-manifold Y is a boundary, i.e., if there exists a bordism X : Hn´1 Ñ Y ,then since αpXq : C Ñ αpY q is an isomorphism we conclude that αpY q is an even line.

(This is a consequence of Deﬁnition 6.24, or see [Re, §2]. In fact, the parity of EulerpW q is determined by X.) Any Morse function expresses W as a composition of elementary bordisms (6.35) and computes αpXq as the product of the corresponding λr. The Euler number of the elementary bordism WrpX 1q rel its incoming boundary is p´1qr, and the Euler number of WrpX 1q is the sum over elementary bordisms. Hence if EulerpW q is even then an equal number of even and odd r occur. It follows from (6.34) that αpXq“ 1, which was to be proved. □ Remark 6.36. If n ”´1 pmod 4q, then every closed n-manifold bounds a compact manifold with even Euler number, hence one with Euler number zero. Ex- ample: S3 “B`CP 2#pS1 ˆ S3qz D4˘.If n ” 1 pmod 4q then it follows from (6.34) that a2 “ 1, and if a “´1tensor α with the Kervaire theory (Example 6.15) to obtain a theory with unit partition function on the sphere. This gives another proof of Theorem 6.27 for n ” 1 pmod 4q. Exercise 6.37. Generalize Theorem 6.27 to arbitrary symmetry types. 6.5. Picard groupoids and spectra Recall (Remark 5.1) that according to Grothendieck’s homotopy hypothesis we can pass freely between topological spaces and 8-groupoids. Now reﬁne that statement by introducing an extra abelian group structure on each side. Definition 6.38. (1) Let T0 be a pointed topological space. Then T0 is a loop space if there exists a pointed topological space T1 and a homotopy equivalence T0 » ΩT1. Itisan inﬁnite loop space if there exists 58 a sequence T0,T1,... of pointed topological spaces such that Tq » ΩTq`1 for all q P Zě0. (2) A spectrum T is a sequence tTquqPZ of pointed spaces and maps sq :ΣTq Ñ Tq`1. (3) An Ω-spectrum is a spectrum T such that the adjoints tq : Tq Ñ ΩTq`1 of the structure maps are weak homotopy equivalences. In particular, T0 is an inﬁnite loop space. A spectrum can be completed to an Ω-spectrum. If T0 is a loop space, then π0T0 – π0ΩT1 – π1T1 is a group. If T0 is a double loop space, then π0T0 – π0Ω2T2 – π2T2 is an abelian group. The higher groupoids πďqT0 also inherit group-like structures: if T0 is an inﬁnite loop space, then πďqT0 is a Picard q-groupoid for all q. In particular, the homotopy groups of a spectrum are abelian groups, and taken together they form a Z-graded abelian group π‚T “ ÀqPZ πqT . Thusaspectrum isareﬁnement ofa Z-graded abelian group. Exercise 6.39. Construct the Picard groupoid structure on the fundamental groupoid πď1T0 of an inﬁnite loop space. How much of the inﬁnite loop structure do you use? 58One may want to make the deloopings data rather than a condition, in which case we arrive at (3). We conﬂate ‘inﬁnite loop space’ and ‘Ω-spectrum’ in the sequel. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 6. INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 93 Conversely, a Picard 8-groupoid is the fundamental 8-groupoid of an inﬁnite loop space, or equivalently the 0-space of an Ω-spectrum. (See [HS, Proposition B.12] for the 1-groupoid version and [L1, Example 2.4.15] for the general case.) Using this identiﬁcation, an invertible ﬁeld theory is a map of spectra; the fact that α in (6.7) is a symmetric monoidal functor translates to the geometric realization ˜α being a spectrum map. We arrive at this conclusion starting from maps of higher categories—which Axiom System 3.1 tells is what a ﬁeld theory is—but we can take all that as motivation and deﬁne an invertible ﬁeld theory to be a map of appropriate spectra. Such a motivated deﬁnition we call an Ansatz. We will take that approach shortly, but ﬁrst we need to know which spectra to use. The discussion is quite diﬀerent for the domain and codomain. The domain is the geometric realization of a bordism spectrum, which we can describe explicitly. The codomain is not determined apriori —see Remark 5.19—but we will see that in the invertible case there is a natural choice. 6.6. Madsen-Tillmann and Thom spectra Ep Cr(V ) V M p π Figure 6.3. The pair `V, CrpV q˘ Let V Ñ M be a real vector bundle over a topological space. Choose an inner product on the ﬁbers, and let CrpV qĂ V be the set of all vectors of norm at least r.The quotient V {CrpV q is called the Thom complex of V Ñ M and is denoted ThompM ; V q. Figure 6.3 provides a convenient illustration: imagine the red region collapsed to a point. Note there is no projection from ThompM ; V q to M ; for example, there is no basepoint in M and no distinguished image of the basepoint in ThompM ; V q. Also, note that the zero section induces an inclusion (6.40) i : M ÝÑ ThompM ; V q. Exercise 6.41. There is a nontrivial real line bundle V Ñ S1, often called the M¨obius bundle. Identify its Thom complex as a familiar pointed space. Proposition 6.42. The Thom complex of R ‘ V Ñ Y is homeomorphic to the suspension of the Thom complex of V Ñ Y . Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 94 6. INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY The Thom complex of the 0-vector bundle—the identity map Y Ñ Y —is the dis- joint union of Y and a single point, which is then the basepoint of the disjoint union. That disjoint union is denoted Y`. Then Proposition 6.42 implies that the Thom complex of R Ñ Y is ΣY`, the suspension of Y`. Iterating, we have ThompY ; Rℓq» ΣℓY`. So the Thom complex is a “twisted suspension” of the base space. Proof. Up to homeomorphism the disk bundle of R ‘ V Ñ Y is the Cartesian product of the unit disk in R and the disk bundle of V Ñ Y .Crushing the complement in R ˆ V to a point is the same crush which forms the suspension of ThompY ; V q, as in Figure 6.4. □ V Y ×R Figure 6.4. The Thom complex of R ‘ V Ñ Y Let π : Xn Ñ BGLn R be an n-dimensional ﬂabby tangential structure (Deﬁ- nition 1.40). Let Sn Ñ BGLn R be the standard rank n real vector bundle. Let GrnpV q denote the Grassmannian of n-dimensional subspaces of a ﬁnite dimen- sional real vector space V . There is a short exact sequence (6.43) 0 ÝÑ S ÝÑ V ÝÑ Q ÝÑ 0 of real vector bundles over GrnpV q in which S Ñ GrnpV q is the canonical subbundle of the trivial bundle and Q Ñ GrnpV q is their quotient.

In short, MT Xn is the Thom spectrum of the virtual bundle ´π˚Sn Ñ Xn The intuition for the last assertion is that, as virtual bundles, Qpqq“´Spnq`Rn`q, so the Thom space of the vector bundle QpqqÑ Xnpn ` qq is the 0-space of the pn ` qqth suspension of ThompXn; ´π˚Snq. The latter is equally the pn ` qqth space of the unsuspended MT Xn,or equivalently the qth space of the suspension ΣnMT Xn. Remark 6.47. The ‘MT’ notation is due to Mike Hopkins and is a play on the ‘M’-notation for Thom spectra (Deﬁnition 6.52 below). ‘MT’ not only stands for ‘Madsen-Tillmann’, but also for a Tangential variant of the thoM spectrum. MT spectra are tangential and unstable; Thom spectra are normal and stable. We will see a precise relationship between MT and Thom spectra in (6.61) below. For Madsen-Tillmann spectra constructed from a symmetry type pHn,ρnq we use the notation MT Hn. For example, the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum for oriented bundles is MT SOn. Exercise 6.48.

The double colimit of (6.55) as n, m Ñ8 yields an involution (6.56) ι : BGL ÝÑ BGL If X Ñ BGL is a stable tangential structure, we deﬁne its pullback by ι to be a new stable tangential structure (6.57) X K \u0004\u0004\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \u0005\u0005\u0006\u0006\u0006 X \u0005\u0005 BGL ι \u0004\u0004 BGL Our next task is to construct a map (6.58) ΣnMT Xn ÝÑ M X K from the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum to the Thom spectrum.

INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 97 on the colimit n Ñ8. It is clear from the construction (6.59) that (6.62) is an equivalence. So the (suitably suspended) Madsen-Tillmann spectra (6.61) deﬁne a ﬁltration of the Thom spectrum M X K. Exercise 6.63. Prove the following equivalences: (6.64) MT O » M O MT Spin » M Spin MT Pin` » M Pin´ MT Pin´ » M Pin` Remark 6.65. Fix a homomorphism of Lie groups ρn : Hn Ñ GLn R as in (1.37), and set Xn “ BHn. The Pontrjagin-Thom construction provides the basic relationship between Xn and Hn-manifolds. Namely, if a map Sk`q Ñ ThompXnpn ` qq; Qpqqq is transverse to the 0-section of QpqqÑ Xnpn ` qq,then the inverse image of the 0-section is a k-dimensional submanifold M Ă Sk`q whose stable tangent bundle is equipped with an isomorphism to the pullback of the tau- tological bundle SpnqÑ Xnpn ` qq; the latter is equipped with an Hn-structure. Theorem 6.67 below implies that the abelian group πkΣnMT Hn is generated by closed k-dimensional Hn-manifolds under disjoint union. The class of a closed man- ifold M k is zero if and only if M “BW where W is a compact pk ` 1q-manifold whose stable tangent bundle is isomorphic to a rank n bundle with an Hn-structure extending that of M . (Deﬁnition 6.24 has a precise statement.) In other words, πkΣnMT Hn is the Reinhart bordism group Ω R k pHnq;see [E, Appendix]. Remark 6.66. Not every element of the homotopy group πkΣnMT Hn is rep- resented by a manifold; group completion of the semigroup of manifold classes is needed to obtain the homotopy group. For example, π0MT O0 – Z but closed 0-dimensional manifolds only realize the submonoid of nonnegative elements. Note that the sphere S2m represents a nonzero element in π2mΣ2mMT SO2m, but is zero in the next group π2m`1Σ2m`1MT SO2m`1: the closed ball D2m`1 has nonzero Euler characteristic so no SO2m-structure. As another illustration, the 2-sphere and the genus 2 surface represent opposite elements of π2Σ2MT SO2:a genus 2 handlebody with a 3-ball excised admits an SO2-structure. The relevance of Madsen-Tillmann spectra for invertible ﬁeld theories is due to the following identiﬁcation of the groupoid completion of a bordism category. Recall that this groupoid completion is the domain of the map ˜α in (6.7). We continue to identify Picard 8-groupoids with inﬁnite loop spaces (stable homotopy hypothesis). Theorem 6.67. | BordnpXnq| is weakly equivalent to the 0-space of the Madsen- Tillmann spectrum ΣnMT Xn. One version of this theorem is proved in [BM], though only for unoriented mani- folds and is carried out for “n-uple categories” rather than p8,nq-categories. The theorem is stated in [L1, §2.5] as a corollary of the cobordism hypothesis. Proofs of Theorem 6.67 in the context of p8,nq-categories have appeared in preprint form. A preprint of Ayala-Francis [AF]proves 59 the cobordism hypothesis and Theo- rem 6.67 for framed manifolds.

INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY complete proof of Theorem 6.67 independent of the cobordism hypothesis. Sec- tion 6.3 illustrates a truncation of Theorem 6.67 in the special case of 1-framed 1-manifolds. 6.7. Duals to the sphere spectrum An abelian group 60 A has two associated dual abelian groups. The character dual 61 A_ “ HompA, Cˆq is its group of characters. The naive Z-dual is HompA, Zq. The naivet´eisevident if A is ﬁnite, for then HompA, Zq“ 0 does not capture any information about A.Enter the derived Z-dual, which is the collection of Ext groups ExtqpA, Zq, q P Z. In fact, only Ext 0pA, Zq and Ext 1pA, Zq are possibly nonzero. Recall that Ext1pA, Zq is the group of isomorphism classes of abelian group extensions (6.68) 0 ÝÑ Z ÝÑ rA ÝÑ A ÝÑ 0. It is natural to extend the dualities to Z-graded abelian groups (6.69) A “ à qPZ Aq. The character dual is (6.70) pA_qq “ HompA´q, Cˆq“pA´qq_. The character dual and Z-dual are related by an application of the exponential short exact sequence (6.71) 0 ÝÑ Zp1qÝÑ C exp ÝÝÝÝÑ Cˆ ÝÑ 1 in which 62 Zp1q“ 2π? ´1Z. Hereafter we replace Z-dual with Zp1q-dual. The derived Zp1q-dual A˚ ﬁts into the long exact sequence (6.72) ¨¨¨ ÝÑ HompA´q, CqÝÑ A_ q ÝÑ A˚ q´1 ÝÑ HompA´pq´1q, Cq ÝÑ ¨¨¨ induced from the exponential sequence (6.71). Remark 6.73. If Aq “ 0for q ­“ 0, so A is ungraded, then (6.72) reduces to (6.74) 0 ÝÑ A˚ 0 ÝÑ HompA0, CqÝÑ A_ 0 ÝÑ A˚ ´1 ÝÑ 0 in which A˚ 0 “ HompA0, Zp1qq and A˚ ´1 “ Ext 1pA, Zp1qq.If φ : A0 Ñ Cˆ is an element of A_ 0 , then its image in A˚ ´1 is represented by the group extension con- structed as the pullback of the exponential sequence (6.71) by φ; we state this more formally below in Proposition 6.84. If we use the standard topology on Cˆ we can topologize A_ 0 “ HompA0, Cˆq as a complex abelian Lie group A. Then the exact sequence (6.74) is the standard exact sequence (6.75) 0 ÝÑ π1A ÝÑ LiepAqÝÑ A ÝÑ π0A ÝÑ 0 in which LiepAq is the Lie algebra of A. The identiﬁcation of Ext 1p´, Zq as the group of components of the continuously topologized character dual will be generalized in §6.9 to an identiﬁcation of the deformation classes of a continuously topologized space of ﬁeld theories. 60For our present illustrative purposes we take A to be discrete and ﬁnitely generated, but without much change it could be a Lie group with ﬁnitely generated π0,π1. 61The closely related Pontrjagin dual is HompA, Tq,where T Ă Cˆ is the circle group. 62The group Zp1q is deﬁned without specifying a choice for ?´1. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 6. INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 99 Remark 6.76. If we pose as a problem to compute the group of deformation classes of characters of an abelian group A0, then by following the line of reasoning in Remark 6.73 we are led to the (shifted) derived Zp1q-dual of A0. Inevitably we discover not only the group A˚ ´1 we were after, but also an extra “piece” A˚ 0 “ HompA0, Zp1qq.If A0 is ﬁnite, then this extra piece vanishes and the derived Zp1q- dual gives the answer on the nose. But, as is typical with derived geometry, what we compute may not be the answer to the original problem. Here our answer is all the homotopy groups of the abelian Lie group A,not just π0.We encounter a similar phenomenon in our problem about invertible topological ﬁeld theories; see §6.10 and Lecture 9. Exercise 6.77. (1) Write the group law on Ext 1 in terms of extensions. (2) Show that the derived Zp1q-dual of the derived Zp1q-dual of A is isomor- phic to A. A spectrum reﬁnes a Z-graded abelian group: its homotopy groups. The char- acter and Z-dual constructions lift to spectra, and reduce to the constructions on Z-graded abelian groups upon passing to homotopy groups; see [HeSt] for an ex- position. Since the sphere spectrum S0 plays the role of Zp1q, its character and Zp1q-duals are the universal codomains for these duals. The character dual to the sphere spectrum, denoted ICˆ, is closely related to the Brown-Comenetz dual [BC] which is the Q{Z-dual to the sphere spectrum. Since C ˆ is an injective abelian group, the character dual can be deﬁned via Brown representability: if B is any spectrum then (6.78) πq MappB,ICˆq“pπ´qBq_. There is also a C-dual HC to the sphere spectrum; it is an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum with the only nonzero homotopy group π0HC – C.The Zp1q-dual IZp1q to the sphere spectrum, known as the Anderson dual [An], [HS, Appendix B], is deﬁned as the homotopy ﬁber of HC Ñ ICˆ; c.f., the exponential exact se- quence (6.71). The spectra ICˆ,IZp1q are co-connective: homotopy groups in positive degrees vanish. The low-lying homotopy groups are (6.79) qπqS0 πqICˆ πqIZp1q 40 0 0 3 Z{24Z 00 2 Z{2Z 00 1 Z{2Z 00 0 ZCˆ Zp1q ´10 μ2 0 ´20 μ2 μ2 ´30 μ24 μ2 ´40 0 μ24 where μk “pZ{kZq_ “ HompZ{kZ, Cˆq is the group of kth roots of unity. From their deﬁnitions, the character and Anderson duals enjoy universal prop- erties. For spectra B, I let rB, Is denote the abelian group of homotopy classes of spectrum maps B Ñ I.

For any spectrum B with π´1B,π0B ﬁnitely generated there is an isomorphism (6.81) rB,IC ˆs– Hompπ0B, Cˆq and a short exact sequence (6.82) 0 ÝÑ Ext 1pπ´1B, Zp1qq ÝÑ rB,IZp1qs ÝÑ Hompπ0B, Zp1qq ÝÑ 0 Furthermore, Ext 1pπ´1B, Zp1qq is the torsion subgroup of rB,IZp1qs,and its free quotient is Hompπ0B, Zp1qq. Here (6.81) is a special case of (6.78), and the short exact sequence (6.82) echoes the situation for discrete abelian groups (6.72). From the exponential sequence (6.71) and the deﬁnition of IZp1q there is a map (6.83) ICˆ ÝÑ ΣIZp1q. Proposition 6.84. For any spectrum B with π0B ﬁnitely generated, the map (6.85) Hompπ0B, CˆqÝÑ Ext 1pπ0B, Zp1qq induced by mapping B into (6.83) maps φ : π0B Ñ Cˆ to the isomorphism class of the pullback of the exponential sequence by φ. Exercise 6.86. Prove Proposition 6.84. Remark 6.87. We can endow Hompπ0B, Cˆq with the structure of a complex abelian Lie group with Lie algebra Hompπ0B, Cq. Then (6.85) is the map π0 onto the group of components, as in (6.75); see §6.9. 6.8. Invertible ﬁeld theories as maps of spectra While we have no canonical choice for the codomain C of an extended topological ﬁeld theory (5.22), an extended invertible topological ﬁeld theory only requires a Picard 8-groupoid, not a full p8,nq-category. This is equivalent to a choice of inﬁnite loop space, or a spectrum. Ansatz 6.88. The codomain of an n-dimensional extended invertible topolog- ical ﬁeld theory is ΣnICˆ. For a theory with Wick-rotated symmetry type pHn,ρnq we use Theorem 6.67 to deduce that the domain should be the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum Σ nMT Hn. Therefore, we arrive at the following. Ansatz 6.89. A discrete invertible n-dimensional extended topological ﬁeld the- ory with symmetry type pHn,ρnq is a spectrum map (6.90) α :ΣnMT Hn ÝÑ ΣnICˆ. The space of theories of this type is MappΣnMT Hn, ΣnICˆq. Here ‘Map’ indicates the space of maps between the indicated spectra. The restric- tion to the mapping space, as opposed to mapping spectrum, is to avoid negative homotopy groups which in any case are not encountered in parameter spaces of theories. The word ‘discrete’ evokes the discrete topology on Cˆ, in contrast to the “continuous” theories we describe in §6.10. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 6. INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 101 Our choice of ΣnICˆ in Ansatz 6.88 can be motivated by the requirement that the partition function of an extended ﬁeld theory determine the theory. This may be something one expects, or would desire, of physical ﬁeld theories, but it is not true in general, even in the topological case. Ansatz 6.88 enforces this condition for invertible topological theories, as follows from the ﬁrst statement in Proposition 6.80, since HompπnΣnMT Hn, Cˆq is the group of Cˆ-valued Reinhart bordism invariants, or equivalently the group of partition functions. That same statement, read backwards, implies that any C ˆ-valued Reinhart bordism invariant is fully local in the sense that it is the partition function of a fully extended invertible topological ﬁeld theory. Remark 6.91. ‘Partition functions determine the theory’ is one motivation for Ansatz 6.88, and having made that choice we observe some magic. First, if α :Σ nMT Hn Ñ ΣnICˆ is an invertible theory, then the induced map on πn is the partition function of n-manifolds. The values of α on pn ´ 1q-manifolds are computed by the induced map on Picard groupoids πxn´1,ny. The codomain πxn´1,nyΣnICˆ – πx´1,0yICˆ has homotopy groups π0 – μ2 and π1 – Cˆ,after shifting up, and there is a nonzero k-invariant. This is equivalent to the Picard groupoid sLineC (Exercise 5.9) of Z{2Z-graded complex lines. This is a physically sensible home for the state space of an invertible theory: there is a single state which is either bosonic or fermionic. Magically, the Bose-Fermi statistics are en- coded in the homotopy groups of ICˆ, so ultimately in the homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum! Turning to pn ´ 2q-manifolds, after shifting we have the target Picard 2-groupoid πx0,1,2yΣ2ICˆ with π0 – μ2, π1 – μ2, π2 – Cˆ, and nontrivial k-invariants connecting neighboring groups. It is equivalent to the Morita-Picard 2- groupoid of central simple complex superalgebras (Example 5.8); see [DeGu, §4.3.5] for a proof of the equivalence. The π0 – μ2 in this nonconnected delooping of sLineC also ﬁts the physics; see [GK, ALW] where objects with nontrivial μ2-grading are termed ‘Majorana’. 6.9. Deformation classes of invertible ﬁeld theories As a warmup, let S be a compact topological space and consider A “ H qpS; Cˆq for some q P Zě0. As written A is a discrete abelian group, but it can be topolo- gized as a complex abelian Lie group with Lie algebra H qpS; Cq, analogous to the discussion in Remark 6.73. Namely, the exponential sequence (6.71) induces a long exact sequence (6.92) ¨¨¨ ÝÑ H qpS; Cq exp ÝÝÝÝÑ H qpS; Cˆq βZp1q ÝÝÝÝÝÑ H q`1pS; Zp1qq ÝÑ ¨¨¨ and the image of exp includes a neighborhood of the identity of A. The continuous topology on the complex vector space H qpS; Cq induces a topology on the neigh- borhood of the identity element of A “ H qpS; Cˆq, and the group law translates it around to the Lie group topology on A. Lemma 6.93. Elements a0,a1 P A lie in the same path component if and only if a1 ´ a0 is in the image of exp. The group π0A is the torsion subgroup of H q`1pS; Zp1qq and π0 : A Ñ π0A is identiﬁed with the integer Bockstein map βZp1q (with codomain the torsion subgroup). Ansatz 6.89 identiﬁes a space MappΣnMT Hn, ΣnICˆq of invertible topological ﬁeld theories, or more precisely a homotopy type. It is topologized analogous to Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 102 6. INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY the discrete topology on A: its group of path components rΣnMT Hn, ΣnICˆs consists of isomorphism classes of ﬁeld theories. In principle, we would like to deﬁne a second topology on MappΣnMT Hn, ΣnICˆq whose path components are deformation classes, but instead we use Lemma 6.93 and the ﬁbration (6.94) HC exp ÝÝÝÝÑ ICˆ ÝÑ ΣIZp1q induced from the exponential sequence to motivate the following. Definition 6.95. Theories α0,α1 P MappΣnMT Hn, ΣnICˆq are deformation equivalent if there exists ξ P H npΣnMT Hn; Cq whose image under exp is the dif- ference rα1s´rα0s of the isomorphism classes rα0s, rα1sPrΣnMT Hn, ΣnICˆs. The ﬁbration (6.94) then immediately implies the following. Theorem 6.96. There is a 1:1 correspondence (6.97) $ & % deformation classes of invertible n-dimensional extended topological ﬁeld theories with symmetry type pHn,ρnq , . - –rΣnMT Hn, Σn`1IZp1qstor. The subscript ‘tor’ denotes the torsion subgroup of the indicated abelian group. This appears, at least implicitly, in a joint paper [FHT] of the author, Mike Hop- kins, and Constantin Teleman; Theorem 6.96 has been the basis of many investi- gations since. 6.10. Continuous invertible topological ﬁeld theories Theorem 6.96 raises an obvious question: What is the ﬁeld theoretic interpre- tation of the abelian group (6.98) rΣnMT Hn, Σn`1IZp1qs ? As we saw in §6.7, derived hom into Zp1q often includes extra characters not in our original cast (Remark 6.76). Torsion elements in (6.98) are deformation classes of discrete invertible topological ﬁeld theories, and now we inquire about elements of inﬁnite order. It turns out the inﬁnite order elements are also included in the answer to our physics classiﬁcation Problem 2.33, as we will see in Lecture 9, but they are not represented by discrete invertible topological ﬁeld theories. Here we give an “integral” interpretation of the full abelian group (6.98). As a warmup, let M be a smooth manifold and consider the following three geometric objects on M : (a) principal C ˆ-bundles P Ñ M with connection (b) principal Cˆ-bundles P Ñ M with ﬂat connection (c) principal Cˆ-bundles P Ñ M The abelian groups of equivalence classes are isomorphic to cohomology groups: 63 (a) qH 2pM q,(b) H 1pM ; Cˆq,and (c) H 2pM ; Zp1qq. Of more direct relevance is the structure induced on the free loop space LM “ MappS1,M q: (a) a smooth function LM Ñ C ˆ (b) a locally constant function LM Ñ C ˆ (c) a principal Zp1q-bundle E Ñ LM 63We discuss diﬀerential cohomology groups qH ‚pM q in §9.4. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 6. INVERTIBILITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 103 In (a) and (b) the function is the holonomy. The isomorphism class of the bundle E Ñ LM in (c)isdeterminedby the homotopy class of the holonomy LM Ñ C ˆ of any connection. Better, we construct the bundle E Ñ LM by “integrating” over the aﬃne space AP of connections on P Ñ M . Namely, an element λ P Cˆ determines a Zp1q-torsor Eλ Ă C of all x P C such that exppxq“ λ, and so the holonomy function LM Ñ Cˆ of a connection Θ P AP on P Ñ M determines a principal Zp1q-bundle EΘ Ñ LM . Altogether, we obtain a principal Zp1q-bundle E Ñ AP ˆ LM .Since the aﬃne space AP of connections is contractible, E Ñ AP ˆ LM descends to a principal Zp1q-bundle E Ñ LM . We have the following types of invertible ﬁeld theories: (a) a non-topological theory (such as Example 2.46) (b) a discrete invertible theory (Ansatz 6.89) (c) a topological ﬁeld theory with partition functions Zp1q-torsors An n-dimensional theory of type (c) is often the truncation of an pn`1q-dimensional theory whose partition functions lie in Z. We make (c) precise using stable homo- topy theory. Ansatz 6.99. A continuous invertible n-dimensional extended topological ﬁeld theory with symmetry type pHn,ρnq is a spectrum map (6.100) ϕ :Σ nMT Hn ÝÑ Σn`1IZp1q. The space of theories of this type is MappΣnMT Hn, Σn`1IZp1qq. A discrete invertible topological ﬁeld theory F gives rise to a continuous invert- ible topological ﬁeld theory ϕF :compose F :ΣnMT Hn Ñ ΣnICˆ with the map ΣnICˆ Ñ Σn`1IZp1q. The continuous theory ϕF retains the homotopical informa- tion in F , in particular its deformation class.

LECTURE 7 Wick-Rotated Unitarity In this lecture and the next we take up unitarity in quantum ﬁeld theory. Now that we have an enhanced notion of locality for Wick-rotated ﬁeld theories (Lec- ture 5), we face the problem of incorporating unitarity into the enhancement. No deﬁnition of extended unitarity is known in general, and it is a very interesting open problem to produce one. We propose a solution for invertible topological theories in Lecture 8. Axiom System 3.1 is for Wick-rotated quantum ﬁeld theory, so our ﬁrst task is to understand the manifestation of ordinary non-extended unitarity under Wick rotation. This is reﬂection positivity in Euclidean ﬁeld theory, which we explain in §7.2 and §7.3. Our treatment separates reﬂection from positivity: reﬂection is data whereas non-extended positivity is a condition. One novelty is our implementation of reﬂection for general symmetry types pHn,ρnq,which we achieve via a co-extension pHn of the group Hn. We explain the positivity condition in §7.4 as it appears in the theory on curved manifolds, and in §7.5 give a nec- essary condition for positivity (Proposition 7.44). We conclude in §7.6 with some inconclusive musings about positivity in codimension 2. This lecture begins with a categorical interpretation of positivity (§7.1) that motivates Lecture 8. 7.1. Positive deﬁnite Hermitian vector spaces Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional complex vector space. A Hermitian form on V is a nondegenerate pairing h : V ˆ V Ñ C between V and its complex conjugate V , the same underlying real vector space with ?´1 acting oppositely. The space of nondegenerate pairings has components distinguished by pairs pp, qq of nonnegative integers with p ` q “ dim V .For each form h there exist maximal subspaces P Ă V on which h is positive deﬁnite and maximal subspaces Q Ă V on which h is negative deﬁnite; for any choices P, Q we have V “ P ‘ Q. The dimensions p, q of P, Q are invariants of h, and are also invariant under deformations of h. Positivity of h is equivalent to P “ V , and is a condition separate from the data of the Hermitian form. We now reformulate positivity in categorical terms. The material in §A.5 on categorical involutions is a prerequisite. Let f VectC denote the topological groupoid of ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces and invertible linear maps. Use the standard topology on invertible linear maps. Also, f VectC is symmetric monoidal under the usual tensor product. The bar involution β : f VectC ÝÑ f VectC maps complex vector spaces and linear maps to their complex conjugates. Duality is a twisted involution (Deﬁnition A.59(1)) δ : f VectC ÝÑ f Vect op C which takes a vector space to its dual and reverses the direction of arrows. The composite βδ is a twisted involution which maps a complex vector space V to V ˚. A ﬁxed point of βδ in the sense of Deﬁnition A.59(2) is a vector space with a Hermitian form. 105 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 106 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY Let f Vect pos C be the topological groupoid of ﬁnite dimensional complex vec- tor spaces equipped with a positive deﬁnite Hermitian inner product, and unitary transformations. Since the inclusion Un ãÑ GLnpCq is a homotopy equivalence, the functor f Vect pos C Ñ f VectC which forgets the inner products is a weak equivalence of topological categories. The combined bar star twisted involution βδ is trivialized on f Vect pos C by the Hermitian inner products. The trivialization is noncanonical, however. We can choose negative deﬁnite vector spaces in place of positive deﬁnite ones. Or, for each prime p, we can make a choice of positive or negative deﬁnite Hermitian inner products on vector spaces of dimension p and thenextendtoall ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces by tensoring. Remark 7.1. This categorical interpretation of positivity suggests that what- ever complex conjugation is in the codomain of an extended ﬁeld theory, on the higher categories in which C is regarded as having a topology, the combined action of complex conjugation and duality should be trivializable. Remark 7.2. On the subgroupoid LineC of complex lines, the homotopy theory picks out positive deﬁnite Hermitian lines (as opposed to negative deﬁnite Hermit- ian lines). This is a consequence of requiring the trivialization of bar star to be compatible with the monoidal structure: the tensor product of positive deﬁnite lines is positive deﬁnite, whereas the same is not true with ‘positive’ replaced by ‘negative’. 7.2. Wick-rotated unitarity in quantum mechanics In quantum mechanics unitarity is manifest: the Hilbert space H of states has a positive deﬁnite Hermitian structure and time evolution Ut of states is by unitary operators. Since Axiom System 3.1 models Wick-rotated systems, to incorporate unitarity into the Axiom System we must ﬁrst understand its transformation under Wick rotation. Here, for quantum mechanics, we use the material in §2.5 about Wick rotation and §2.6 about the interpretation of quantum mechanics in the Axiom System. Let (7.3) F :Bord1pSO∇ 1 qÝÑ tVectC be a Wick-rotated quantum mechanical model. Then F ppt`q is the state space H as a topological vector space, but there is no inner product. 64 Observe that (a completion of) the topological vector space F ppt´q is in duality with H, but there is no Hermitian form. Thus we need new data which identiﬁes F ppt´q as the complex conjugate of F ppt`q. In other words, the Hermitian structure can be encoded by implementing the slogan (7.4) orientation-reversal ÞÝÑ complex conjugation For then F ppt´q is isomorphic to both H and also isomorphic to H˚;the composi- tion of these isomorphisms is a Hermitian form. We have not made this argument precise as we have not spelled out which topological vector spaces to use. The ana- log in the topological case is for ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces and is elementary linear algebra, and that is all we use in these lectures. 64We actually obtain a family of topological vector spaces; see the text preceding Proposi- tion 4.36. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY 107 This motivates encoding Wick-rotated unitarity as additional data for the func- tor (7.3). The domain has the involution of orientation-reversal, the codomain the involution of complex conjugation, and what is needed is equivariance data (Deﬁ- nition A.57) together with a positivity condition. Example 7.5. Aparticleon S1 with θ-angle illustrates (7.4); see §2.2 for the case θ “ 0. In this case we construct a family of theories Fθ parametrized by θ P R, and orientation-reversal maps Fθ to F´θ. There is a lagrangian description of Fθ: if λpsq“ e iφpsq describes the motion of a particle, φ : X 1 Ñ R, then the lagrangian density is (7.6) L “ 1 2 9φ2|ds|´ θλ˚pωq, where ω P Ω1 S1 satisﬁes ş S1 ω “ 1 for some ﬁxed orientation of S1.Let Lθ Ñ S1 be the complex line bundle with covariant derivative of holonomy e iθ. Then the Hilbert space of states of the theory at θ is Hθ “ L2pS1; Lθq. The Hamiltonian Hθ “ Δθ is the Laplace operator on Hθ, and the Wick-rotated operator attached to an interval of length τ is e ´τ Δθ . The implementation of orientation-reversal is complex conjugation: H ÞÝÑ H(7.7) e ´τ Δ ÞÝÑ e´τ Δ “ e ´Δ´θ(7.8) It maps the theory at θ to the theory at ´θ. Exercise 7.9. Construct a lift of the Z-action by translation θ ÞÑ θ ` 2π to this family of theories. What is the group generated by this action and the involution (7.7), (7.8)? 7.3. Wick-rotated unitarity in Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory We turn to ﬁeld theories in higher dimensions. Consider the basic symmetry type Hn “ SOn with ρn :SOn ãÑ On the inclusion. In Euclidean ﬁeld theory unitarity is expressed as reﬂection positivity, an essential ingredient in the recon- struction of a unitary theory in Minkowski spacetime [OS]. Reﬂection positivity is another manifestation of the slogan (7.4). Let n be the spacetime dimension and En standard Euclidean n-space. Fix an aﬃne hyperplane Π Ă En and let σ denote (aﬃne) reﬂection about Π. Let O be an operator, or product of operators, in the quantum theory which is supported in the open half-space En ` on one side of Π; the reﬂected operator σpOq has support in the complementary half-space En ´.Let xOyEn ` P H denote the half-space correlation function, which is a vector in the Hilbert space of the theory. In a lagrangian ﬁeld theory it is the functional integral over the half-space En `. Then the reﬂection part of ‘reﬂection positivity’ is (7.10) xσpOqyEn ´ “ xOyEn ` ; see (7.8) for the analog in quantum mechanics. The Hilbert space H is associated to pΠ, oq,where o is an orientation of the normal line to Π, the arrow of time. The reﬂection σ reverses o, and the Hilbert space associated to pΠ, ´oq is the complex Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 108 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY Figure 7.1. Reﬂection positivity in Euclidean space conjugate (7.11) HpΠ,´oq – ÝÝÝÑ HpΠ,oq; see (7.7) for the analog in quantum mechanics. Therefore, xσpOqyEn ´ P H and (7.10) is an equation in the complex conjugate Hilbert space H.The positivity part of ‘reﬂection positivity’ is the positive deﬁniteness of H, which implies in particular that the norm square of the vector xOyEn ` is nonnegative: (7.12) xσpOq OyEn ě 0 Our next task is to extend this formulation to a general symmetry type pHn,ρnq. Essentially, we must extend the SOn story to include an internal symmetry group K. As motivation we make the following heuristic comments. For simplicity consider the Cartesian product symmetry type Hn “ SOn ˆK.Let X be Euclidean space with an open neighborhood of the support of the operators O, σpOq removed. Let Y “BX X H` and assume σpY q“BX X H´. In general there are twist operators which are deﬁned by a principal K-bundle P Ñ X, as in Remark 5.29. The reﬂection σ must account for the K-bundle, and it might seem at ﬁrst that σ should “reverse” the bundle by an involution on K. But that does not happen; rather σ lifts to P Ñ X. We give three arguments to justify the existence of a lift of σ. ‚ If O is a point operator, then Y is a sphere. Identify σpY q with Y via translation. Then σ acts on Y as reﬂection in the equatorial plane par- allel to Π. If we one-point compactify X to Sn minus the two balls and assume P extends over the compactiﬁcation, then the restrictions of P to Y and σpY q are isomorphic, since the compactiﬁcation is diﬀeomorphic to r0, 1sˆ Sn´1. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY 109 ‚ Continuing, suppose P Ñ X is the trivial bundle and V is the vector space of local operators attached to Y . (In a geometric theory we take a limit as the radius of the removed ball shrinks to zero.) The automorphism group K of the trivial bundle over Y acts on V , producing K-multiplets of point operators. Postulate a lift of σ to P Ñ X. The hyperplane reﬂection σ induces an isomorphism V Ñ V which commutes with the K- action, since geometrically the lift of reﬂection to the trivial bundle P Ñ X commutes with the global gauge transformations. So a K-multiplet in V is mapped to a K-multiplet in V which transforms in the complex conjugate representation. This is the expected behavior. ‚ Let n “ 1and H1 “ SO1 ˆZ{3Z.Let α :Bordx0,1ypH1qÑ VectC be the invertible theory which attaches a nontrivial character χ : Z{3Z Ñ T to the positively oriented point with its trivial Z{3Z-bundle. (That object Y of the bordism category has automorphism group Z{3Z, which then acts on the vector space αpY q.) This theory is unitary, a ﬁnite analog of Example 2.46. Now αpP Ñ S1q is χ applied to the holonomy of the principal Z{3Z-bundle P Ñ S1. Reﬂection reverses the orientation of S1, and if the bundle stays the same under reﬂection, then the holonomy complex conjugates, which is precisely what it should do in a reﬂection positive theory. We use reﬂection symmetry (7.10) to construct a larger symmetry group pHn from Hn by adjoining an involution. In the special case Hn “ Spinn, we deﬁne pHn “ Pin ` n ; the general case is a bootstrap from this. We choose Pin` n rather than Pin´ n so that the lift of a hyperplane reﬂection squares to the identity. The arguments above motivate the triviality of the hyperplane reﬂection automorphism of the internal symmetry group K. Regard pHn as a symmetry group of the Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory; the action of an element in pHnzHn on the Hilbert space H is by an anti-unitary transformation. The context for the next result is §3.4; the proof is in [FH1, §3.3]. Theorem 7.13. (1) There exists a canonical group extension (7.14) 1 ÝÑ Hn jnÝÝÝÑ pHn ÝÑ t˘1uÝÑ 1, split (noncanonically) by a choice of hyperplane reﬂection σ P On, such that the splitting induces an automorphism of ĄSH n – Spinn ˆK which is the product of conjugation by σ on Spinn and is the identity automorphism of K. (2) There is a homomorphism ˆρn which ﬁts into the pullback diagram (7.15) Hn jn \u0004\u0004 ρn \u0005\u0005 pHn ˆρn \u0005\u0005 On \u0004\u0004 t˘1uˆ On (3) There are inclusions ˆın : pHn Ñ pHn`1 which, together with the inclusions in : Hn Ñ Hn`1, induce a commutative diagram linking (7.15) for vary- ing n.

WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY (4) For each n ě 1 there is an inclusion of group extensions (7.16) 1 \u0004\u0004 Hn \u0004\u0004\u0002 \u0003 in \u0005\u0005 t˘1uˆ Hn \u0004\u0004 \u0002 \u0003 sn`1˚jn`1in \u0005\u0005 t˘1u \u0004\u0004 1 1 \u0004\u0004 Hn`1 jn`1 \u0004\u0004 pHn`1 \u0004\u0004 t˘1u \u0004\u0004 1 in which in is the inclusion in (3.25), jn the inclusion in (7.14),and sn : t˘1uÑ pHn the splitting of (7.14) induced by the hyperplane reﬂection which reverses the ﬁrst coordinate of R n and ﬁxes the others. Furthermore, the inclusions in and ˆın induce a commutative diagram linking (7.16) for varying n. For the basic symmetry groups in (3.23) the extended symmetry groups are listed here: (7.17) states/symmetry Hn pHn bosons only SOn On fermions allowed Spinn Pin ` n bosons, time-reversal (T )On t˘1uˆ On fermions, T 2 “p´1qF Pin ` n yPin ` n fermions, T 2 “ id Pin ´ n yPin ´ n The splitting of pOn is a consequence of the fact that hyperplane reﬂections are inner in On. A similar argument proves that the 4-component group yPin ˘ n can be constructed from Pin˘ n by adjoining the automorphism which is the identity on Spinn Ă Pin˘ n and multiplication by the central element ´1 P Spinn on the oﬀ-component of Pin ˘ n . Remark 7.18. We deploy the co-extension (7.14) to formulate reﬂection posi- tivity on En for a theory with arbitrary symmetry type pHn,ρnq. Adjoining trans- lations via the pullback (7.19) 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 Hn \u0005\u0005\u0006\u0006\u0006 \u0004\u0004\u0007\u0007\u0007 Eucn \u0005\u0005 \u0004\u0004 1 1 \u0004\u0004 K \u0004\u0004 Hn ρn \u0004\u0004 On \u0004\u0004 1 we obtain a larger group Hn and a homomorphism Hn Ñ Eucn to the Euclidean group. The complex point observables form a vector bundle OC Ñ En,and OC carries an action of Hn lifting that of Eucn on En. Theorem 7.13 gives a co- extension pHn of Hn and a homomorphism pHn Ñt˘1uˆ Eucn. As in (7.10)–(7.12) ﬁx a hyperplane reﬂection σ and now ﬁx a lift ˆσ P pHn of p´1,σqP t˘1uˆ Eucn. Part of the data of the reﬂection structure is a lift of ˆσ to an antilinear map of the complex vector bundle OC Ñ En. Now (7.10)–(7.12) apply with ˆσ replacing σ. 7.4. Reﬂection structures and naive positivity Now we turn to curved manifolds and the implementation of reﬂection positivity in Axiom System 3.1, though we only treat the topological case in these lectures.

WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY 111 Recall (Deﬁnition 3.33) that an Hn-manifold is a Riemannian n-manifold equipped with a reduction pP, θq of its orthonormal frame bundle BOpXqÑ X to Hn. Extend the principal Hn-bundle P Ñ X toaprincipal pHn-bundle jnpP qÑ X,where jn is the inclusion in (7.14). If P Ñ X has a connection, then the con- nection extends canonically to jnpP qÑ X. Use (7.15) to extend the isomorphism θ : BOpXqÑ ρnpP q to an isomorphism ˆθ : t˘1uˆ BOpXqÑ ˆρn`jnpP q˘ . Definition 7.20. The opposite Hn-structure pP 1,θ1q is the principal Hn-bundle P 1 :“ jnpP qzP Ñ X and the restriction θ1 of ˆθ to t´1uˆ BOpXq. The same deﬁnition works for diﬀerential Hn-structures: simply carry along the connection. Taking opposites is involutive: there is a canonical isomorphism pP, θq – ÝÝÑpP 2,θ2q. Remark 7.21. Let σ P On be a hyperplane reﬂection and φσ the automorphism of Hn resulting from the splitting of (7.14). Then we can identify the principal Hn- bundle P 1 Ñ X as the projection P Ñ X of manifolds with the original Hn-action on P modiﬁed by precomposition with the automorphism φσ. For if ˜σ P pHn is the splitting element, then we have an isomorphism (7.22) P ÝÑ jnpP qzP p ÞÝÑ p ¨ ˜σ of principal Hn-bundles. Example 7.23. An SOn-structure is an orientation, and the opposite SOn- structure is the reverse orientation: P Ñ X is the principal SOn-bundle of ori- ented orthonormal frames, jnpP qÑ X the principal On-bundle BOpXqÑ X of all orthonormal frames, and jnpP qzP Ñ X the principal SOn-bundle of oppositely oriented orthonormal frames. Example 7.24. For simplicity, we sometimes abbreviate ‘Pin˘ n -structure’ to ‘pin structure’, just as ‘Spinn-structure’ is abbreviated to ‘spin structure’. The op- posite functor acts trivially on unoriented manifolds (On-structures). The opposite of a pin structure is obtained by tensoring with the orientation double cover, as is easily derived from the text following (7.17). Use the involution in Deﬁnition 7.20 to construct an involution of geometric bordism categories (7.25) βB “ β :Bordxn´1,nypH ∇ n qÑ Bordxn´1,nypH ∇ n q. In Deﬁnition A.52 we explain that an involution on a category B is a functor β : B Ñ B and a natural transformation of functors η :idB Ñ β2. The objects and mor- phisms in Bordxn´1,nypH ∇ n q are Riemannian manifolds with diﬀerential Hn-struc- ture: the functor β ﬁxes the underlying Riemannian manifold and ﬂips the diﬀer- ential Hn-structure to its opposite. The equivalence η implements the canonical isomorphism indicated after Deﬁnition 7.20. We emphasize that the “bar involu- tion” β is covariant: a morphism X : Y0 Ñ Y1 maps to a morphism βX : βY0 Ñ βY1. Put diﬀerently, the arrows of time on objects are unchanged under β. Now we specialize to the topological case. First, recall that every object in the unoriented topological bordism category has a dual (Lemma 1.20). This as- sertion extends to an arbitrary symmetry type pHn,ρnq as follows. Recall that an object Y in Bordxn´1,nypHnq is a compact pn ´ 1q-manifold without boundary, an Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 112 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY Hn-structure on R ‘ TY Ñ Y , and an orientation of the subbundle R Ñ Y , called the arrow of time. Lemma 7.26. Y has a dual Y _ which equals Y with the reversed arrow of time. Proof. As manifolds evaluation eY and coevaluation cY are r0, 1sˆ Y , but the arrows of time are diﬀerent; see Figure 1.4. □ Every object Y in a topological bordism category has a canonical Hermitian structure in the sense of Deﬁnition A.62. Proposition 7.27. For any object Y in Bordxn´1,nypHnq there is a canonical isomorphism (7.28) βY – ÝÝÝÑ Y _ In other words, reversing the Hn-structure (βY )isequivalenttoreversing thearrow of time (Y _). We defer to [FH1, Proposition 4.8] for the proof. Remark 7.29. As an illustration of these involutions, we point out that in the proof of Theorem 6.27 the bordisms pH 1 r, pH 2 r are obtained from h1 r,h2 r by applying the commuting involutions β and δ,where δ is the duality involution. Because of Proposition 7.27 the boundary—with orientation—is unchanged by βδ. Let (7.30) βC “ β : VectC ÝÑ VectC be the involution of complex conjugation. Recall the involution βB on bordism in (7.25). Let (7.31) F :Bordxn´1,nypHnqÑ VectC be a non-extended topological ﬁeld theory. Definition 7.32. A reﬂection structure on F is equivariance data for the in- volutions βB,βC. Equivariance data is spelled out in Deﬁnition A.57. For every closed pn ´ 1q- manifold Y with Hn-structure we have an isomorphism of vector spaces (7.33) F pβY q – ÝÝÝÑ F pY q, the curved space analog of (7.11). Combining with the isomorphism (7.28), we see that F peY q becomes the Hermitian form (7.34) hY : F pY _qb F pY q– F pβY qb F pY q– F pY qb F pY qÝÑ C, which by the “S-diagram” argument in Figure 1.5 is nondegenerate. Sesquilinearity is a consequence of the isomorphism (7.35) eY ÝÑ βpeY q pt, yq ÞÝÑ p1 ´ t, yq The reﬂection structure includes a curved space analog of (7.10): if X is a closed Hn-manifold, then (7.36) F pβXq“ F pXq. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY 113 We remark that (7.36) is a strong constraint. For example, in a theory of unoriented manifolds (Hn “ On) β is the identity functor and (7.36) implies that all partition functions are real. Deﬁnition 7.32 is the ‘reﬂection’ half of ‘reﬂection positivity’. The ‘positivity’ half ensures quantum state spaces are Hilbert spaces. Definition 7.37. A reﬂection structure is positive if the induced Hermitian form hY is positive deﬁnite for all Y P Bordxn´1,nypHnq. Remark 7.38. In a non-extended ﬁeld theory reﬂection is data and positivity is a condition. In the extended case taken up in 7.6 and Lecture 8, both reﬂection and positivity are data. Example 7.39. Let n be even and μ P Cˆ. The invertible Euler theory ϵμ :Bordxn´1,nypOnqÑ LineC in (1.53) has ϵμpSnq“ μ 2.If ϵμ admits a reﬂec- tion structure, then we must have μ2 P R. Positivity imposes a stronger constraint. Let D be the manifold Dn with outgoing boundary S “ Sn´1.Write Sn as the composition ∅ n´1 D ÝÝÑ Sn´1 βD_ ÝÝÝÑ ∅n´1 of two closed balls. This composition may be rewritten as (7.40) Hn´1 βD>D ÝÝÝÝÝÝÑ S > S eSÝÝÝÑHn´1, which ϵμ evaluates to hS`βϵμpDq,ϵμpDq˘ . Therefore, if ϵμ is positive, then μ2 ą 0 and so μ P R. This is a special case of an argument about doubles we give in the next section. We can also conclude μ P R from μ “ ϵμpRP nq, since the partition function of a closed manifold must be real in an unoriented theory with reﬂection structure. However, the argument with doubles also applies to the oriented Euler theory Bordxn´1,nypSOnqÑ LineC, whereas the argument with RP n does not. 7.5. Positivity and doubles Continuing with the symmetry type pHn,ρnq,let (7.41) F :Bordxn´1,nypHnqÝÑ VectC be a non-extended topological ﬁeld theory with reﬂection structure (Deﬁnition 7.32). In §7.4 we discussed the analogs (7.33) and (7.36) of the data (7.11) and the equa- tion (7.10) in Euclidean ﬁeld theory, which are encoded by the reﬂection structure. Now we take up the Axiom System analog of the positivity condition (7.12) in Eu- clidean ﬁeld theory. We begin with the deﬁnition of the double of a manifold with boundary. Recall the bar involution β on bordisms (7.25). Definition 7.42. Let X be a compact Hn-manifold with boundary, viewed as abordism Hn´1 ÑBX.The double of X is the closed Hn-manifold (7.43) ΔX “ eBX pβX, Xq, where eBX is the evaluation bordism. The double is illustrated in Figure 7.2. In that picture Y “BX. The double con- struction is standard in diﬀerential geometry for unoriented and oriented manifolds, but less so for general tangential structures such as spin and pin. Our deﬁnition uses the group co-extension (7.14), through the involution β, so is ultimately based on hyperplane reﬂections in Euclidean space, as conforms with intuition for the double and the model case: En as the double of a half space. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 114 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY Figure 7.2. The double of X Proposition 7.44. If a topological ﬁeld theory F :Bordxn´1,nypHnqÑ VectC admits a positive reﬂection structure, then F pΔXqě 0 for all compact Hn-mani- folds X with boundary. Note that the value of a theory on a closed n-manifold does not depend on the reﬂection structure, so this is a necessary condition on non-extended theories as deﬁned by Axiom System 1.17. Proof. Assume F has a positive reﬂection structure. From (7.43) and (7.36) we deduce (7.45) F pΔXq“ F peBX q`F pβXq,F pXq˘ “ hBX ` F pXq,F pXq˘ “}F pXq}2 F pBXq, which is nonnegative by positivity (Deﬁnition 7.37). □ Example 7.46. Consider the 2-dimensional theory F :Bordx1,2ypSO2qÑ VectC constructed from the Frobenius algebra A “ H ‚pS2; Cq; see Theorem 4.22 and Example 4.21. Write S2 as the composition (7.40) of two disks to deduce that F pS2q“ τ p1q“ 0, where τ : A Ñ C is the trace and 1 P A the unit. It follows that F does not admit a positive reﬂection structure, since the norm square of 1 is positive for any Hilbert space structure on A. The homogeneous space Hn`1{Hn is diﬀeomorphic to the sphere Sn.This follows from the fact that the squares in (3.25) are pullbacks. The homogeneous principal Hn-bundle Hn`1 Ñ Hn`1{Hn is part of an Hn-structure on Sn;the associated bundle to ρn : Hn Ñ On is isomorphic to the orthonormal frame bundle. Proposition 7.47. The sphere Sn with Hn-structure Hn`1 Ñ Hn`1{Hn is a double. Proof. Reﬂection σ in the hyperplane perpendicular to e1 is an involution of Sn with ﬁxed point set the equatorial Sn´1 perpendicular to e1. The reﬂection lifts to an isomorphism of the principal Hn-bundle Hn`1 Ñ Hn`1{Hn with the pullback of its opposite; see [FH1, Proposition 3.13]. □ Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY 115 Exercise 7.48. Which spin circle is a double? (There are two spin structures on S1.) The universal family of Hn-spheres is the ﬁber bundle (7.49) Hn`1{Hn ÝÑ BHn ÝÑ BHn`1. It plays an important role in the obstruction theory analysis in §8.1. We now prove that any two Hn-doubles are bordant. They are not Reinhart bordant, which would be bordant through an Hn-manifold, but rather they are Thom bordant. Proposition 7.50. Let Y0,Y1 be closed pn ´ 1q-dimensional Hn-manifolds and X : Y0 Ñ Y1 an Hn-bordism. Then (7.51) βX > eY1 > X : βY0 > Y0 ÝÑ Hn´1 is Hn`1-bordant to eY0 . Proof. The bordism 65 is r0, 1sˆ X. □ Corollary 7.52. The double ΔX of a compact Hn-manifold with boundary is null bordant through an Hn`1-manifold. By Corollary 7.47 this applies to Sn with its canonical Hn-structure, and so every double is Hn`1-bordant to Sn. Proof. Apply Proposition 7.50 to X : Hn´1 ÑBX (and smooth the corners of r0, 1sˆ X). Figure 7.3 illustrates the construction. □ X ΔX [0,1] × X Figure 7.3. B`r0, 1sˆ X˘ “t0uˆ X Yr0, 1sˆBX Yt1uˆ X Remark 7.53. If X is the 2-dimensional disk, viewed as a bordism from the empty 1-manifold to the circle, then ΔX is the 2-dimensional sphere S2 and the null bordism r0, 1sˆ X is the 3-dimensional ball D3. The nonzero Euler number of S2 obstructs the existence of an H2-structure on D3 which restricts to the given H2-structure on S2 (for any stable tangential structure H). 65It is a bordism of manifolds with boundary, or better a higher morphism in a multi-bordism category. We only use Y0 “Hn´1, as in Corollary 7.52, in which case r0, 1sˆ X is a null bordism of a closed manifold.

Introduction to extended reﬂection structures and positivity Once one has in hand a theory of involutions on higher categories, then there should be no diﬃculty deﬁning a reﬂection structure on an extended topological ﬁeld theory (5.22) with symmetry type pHn,ρnq. One need only deﬁne the bar involutions on the extended bordism n-category BordnpHnq and on the codomain symmetric monoidal n-category C.On BordnpHnq the objects and morphisms at all levels have underlying Hn-manifolds with corners; the involution reverses the Hn- structure66 as in Deﬁnition 7.20. The situation is diﬀerent for the codomain C,since we do not make any formal hypotheses on the nature of C. Abstractly we simply require an n-category C with involution βC, but we may also require pC,βCq to agree “near the top” with VectC and complex conjugation. We focus on n “ 2and C “ AlgC, as in Example 5.8, with involution βC complex conjugation of algebras, bimodules, and intertwiners. We want to “impose” positivity on an extended reﬂection structure. General principles of category number suggest that whereas in the non-extended case pos- itivity is a condition, in the extended case it should be data. Thatisindeed the case for invertible topological theories, which is the only situation in which we have a notion of extended positivity, which we develop in Lecture 8 using homotopy theory. Question 7.54. What is extended positivity in an extended ﬁeld theory with reﬂection structure? This is an open problem, even for topological ﬁeld theories. The two pillars of quantum ﬁeld theory are locality and unitarity, so it is a fundamental issue to marry unitarity with extended locality. To illustrate Question 7.54, we conclude this lecture by exploring positivity for complex conjugation on the 2-category AlgC. (We use ordinary, not super, algebras to avoid signs.) It would be interesting to have a categorical approach analogous to that in §7.1 for the 1-category VectC. To begin we identify duals in AlgC. Lemma 7.55. The dual to an algebra A P AlgC is the opposite algebra Aop. Note that every object has a dual: 1-dualizability is automatic. Higher dualizability imposes stringent ﬁniteness conditions (for a few examples, see [Dav, §3.2] as well as [DSPS, BJS]. Proof. Let evaluation eA : Aop b A Ñ C be A as a right pAop b Aq-module, and let coevaluation cA : C Ñ A b Aop be A as a left pA b Aopq-module. □ Exercise 7.56. Check the S-diagram relations. Hence the duality involution δ :AlgC Ñ Algop C takes an algebra A to Aop;a 1- morphism B : A0 Ñ A1,which is an pA1,A0q-bimodule, to the pAop 0 ,Aop 1 q-bimodule B; and a 2-morphism f : B Ñ B1 between 1-morphisms B, B1 : A0 Ñ A1 to itself. Note δ reverses the direction of 1-morphisms and preserves the direction of 2- morphisms.67 The 2-category AlgC has an (untwisted) bar involution β which complex conjugates at all levels: A ÞÑ A, B ÞÑ B, f ÞÑ ¯f . 66Recall that we either stabilize the tangent bundle to have rank n or embed in a germ of an n-manifold. Thus Hn-structures are deﬁned on manifolds of dimension ă n in terms of the frame bundle of a rank n vector bundle. 67An alternative twisted duality involution: map B to B˚ : Aop 0 Ñ Aop 1 and f to f ˚,thereby preserving the direction of 1-morphisms and reversing the direction of 2-morphisms. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY 117 Now suppose A P AlgC is a Hermitian object, a complex algebra equipped with an isomorphism A – ÝÝÑ Aop in AlgC. In other words, the data is an invert- ible pAop, Aq-bimodule, or equivalently a right pA b Aq-module B. Invertibility is exhibited by a left pA b Aq-module B1 and isomorphisms (7.57) B bA B1 – ÝÝÝÑ A of pA, Aq-bimodules, B bA B1 – ÝÝÝÑ A of pA, Aq-bimodules. A special case is a ˚-structure. Definition 7.58. Let A be a complex algebra. A ˚-structure on A is an algebra isomorphism ˚ : A Ñ Aop such that ˚˚ “ idA. Alternatively, ˚ : A Ñ A is an anti-linear anti-homomorphism. The Hermitian structure on A is exhibited by the module B “ A with right pA b Aq-action (7.59) b ¨pa1 b ¯aq“ a˚ba1,a, a1,b P A. The inverse is B1 “ A with left pA b Aq-action (7.60) p¯a b a1q¨ b 1 “ a1b 1a˚,a, a1,b 1 P A, and the isomorphisms (7.57) are (7.61) b b b 1 ÞÝÑ b 1˚b ˚ b b b 1 ÞÝÑ b 1b respectively. We are led to the following special case of Question 7.54. Question 7.62. What is positivity for a ˚-structure or a more general Hermit- ian structure on A? Remark 7.63. ˚-algebras and their inﬁnite dimensional topological versions, C ˚-algebras and von Neumann algebras, make frequent appearances in mathemat- ical treatments of quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory. Indeed, quantum mechanics was a main impetus for the development of operator algebras [vN2]. In that context positivity is built in from the beginning since one starts with a positive deﬁnite Hilbert space. Here is a guess about positivity, which we leave as an extended exercise for the reader. Let a Hermitian structure on A be givenasaninvertible pAop, Aq-module B, as in the paragraph containing (7.57). Then B˚ is an invertible pA, A opq-bimodule. Form the complex vector space (7.64) L “ A bAbA op pB b B˚qbAopbA A. Exercise 7.65. (1) Construct a real structure on L. (2) If A is invertible, prove that dim L “ 1. (A standard theorem about central simple algebras states that A is invertible if and only if the natural map A b Aop Ñ End A is an isomorphism.) (3) What is L in thecaseofa ˚-structure? (4) Extend the entire discussion to a Z{2Z-graded algebra A P sAlgC. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 118 7. WICK-ROTATED UNITARITY Assuming (1) and (2), deﬁne positivity data on A in the invertible case to be a real trivialization of L, i.e., a real isomorphism C Ñ L. This ﬁts well with what we ﬁnd using homotopy theory in Lecture 8. But then what is positivity if A is not invertible? Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. LECTURE 8 Extended Positivity and Stable Homotopy Theory This lecture contains our main theorems, which determine the homotopy type of various spaces of invertible ﬁeld theories. In particular, the abelian group of path components is isomorphic to the abelian group of isomorphism classes or de- formation classes of various spaces of invertible unitary extended topological ﬁeld theories with ﬁxed dimension and symmetry type. For unitary theories the answer is a cohomology group of a Thom spectrum, and there are techniques in stable homotopy theory to compute these groups. We apply the theorems in Lecture 10, where we report on computations for fermion systems and compare to the con- densed matter literature. To state these theorems we need to deﬁne reﬂection positivity—the Wick rotation of unitarity—for extended invertible ﬁeld theories. The framework for reﬂection structures involves involutions, here on spectra, and so we work in equivariant stable homotopy theory. We must choose involutions on both the domain B and codomain I of an invertible ﬁeld theory α : B Ñ I;the reﬂection structure is then equivariance data for α. We deﬁne positivity for ﬁeld theories in homotopy theoretic terms as well. This only involves the codomain I:a reﬂection structure on an n-dimensional theory allows a factorization of its pn ´ 1q- dimensional truncation through a Hermitian version of I and we ask that it further factor through a positive version of I. At the top level this reduces to naive positiv- ity (7.4). Given these deﬁnitions the desired homotopy types are computed using standard techniques in topology. Here is an outline, then, of the lecture. In §8.1 we explain the relationship between naive positivity—more precisely, the consequence that partition functions of doubles are positive (Proposition 7.44)—and stability, the latter a special notion (Deﬁnition 8.8) for invertible theories in which the theory factors through the map from a Madsen-Tillmann spectrum to a Thom spectrum. In §8.2 we give a brief introduction to equivariant spectra, focusing on spectra with involutions. Then in §8.3 we specify the involutions on codomain spectra I which implement complex conjugation. This leads to several variations, which at the level of super lines cor- respond to Hermitian structures, positive Hermitian structures, real structures, ﬂat structures, etc. These higher versions, which we call ‘super k-lines’, are described in homotopy theoretic terms in §8.4. We deﬁne extended positivity in §8.5, of course only working in the invertible context. (As stated in Question 7.54, it is an impor- tant open problem to deﬁne extended positivity in general.) One crucial maneuver is an argument to “split oﬀ a reﬂection”. We deﬁne the space of extended reﬂection positive theories as a ﬁber product (8.54). A reworking leads to Deﬁnition 8.62 of an extended positivity structure on a particular theory. It is the usual positivity of a Hermitian form in dimension n ´ 1, and is data in lower dimensions. Finally, in §8.6 we state the main theorems which determine the homotopy types of relevant spaces 119 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 120 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY of reﬂection positive unitary theories. We do not include proofs in this lecture; they are all contained in [FH1, §8]. 8.1. Naive positivity and stability Recall (Deﬁnition 6.45) that to a symmetry type pHn,ρnq we attach the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum Σ nMT Hn, the Thom spectrum of the virtual bundle (8.1) Rn ´ Sn ÝÑ BHn. Stabilization (3.25) determines a spectrum map Σ nMT Hn Ñ Σn`1MT Hn`1. Proposition 8.2. The ﬁber of the map ΣnMT Hn ÝÑ Σn`1MT Hn`1 is ΣnpBHn`1q`.The map ΣnpBHn`1q` Ñ ΣnMT Hn is represented by the uni- versal family BHn Ñ BHn`1 of Hn-spheres. Proof. Equivalently, as we prove, there is a ﬁbration sequence (8.3) Σ´1MT Hn ÝÑ MT Hn`1 ÝÑ pBHn`1q` in which the ﬁrst map is stabilization. Begin with the coﬁbration built from the sphere and ball bundles of the universal bundle Sn Ñ BHn: (8.4) SpSnq`\u0005 \u0002 \u0004\u0004 BpSnq` \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004 `BpSnq,SpSnq˘ , Then identify BHn´1 as the unit sphere bundle SpSnq and write (8.4) in terms of Thom spaces: (8.5) ThompBHn´1; R0q\u0005 \u0002 \u0004\u0004 ThompBHn; R0q \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004 ThompBHn; Snq . Here R0 is the vector bundle of rank zero. Now add ´Sn to each of the vector bundles in (8.5) and note that the restriction of Sn to BHn´1 is Sn´1 ‘ R1. □ Exercise 8.6. Use Proposition 8.2 to construct the Euler theory (Exam- ple 6.13) via as a map of spectra with an explicit trivialization of its trunca- tion (6.14) in codimension one. The sequence of MT spectra (8.7) ΣnMT Hn inÝÝÝÑ Σn`1MT Hn`1 in`1 ÝÝÝÝÑ ¨ ¨ ¨ with colimit the Thom spectrum MT H allows us to make a special deﬁnition for invertible topological ﬁeld theories which is not part of general quantum ﬁeld theory. Definition 8.8. An n-dimensional invertible topological ﬁeld theory with do- main Σ nMT Hn is stable if it is the restriction of a theory deﬁned on MT H. Note that the partition function of a stable invertible theory is a Thom bordism in- variant. (Compare with the assertion in Theorem 6.27(2) about arbitrary invertible theories). We apply the relationship (§7.5) between naive positivity and doubles to deduce a criterion for stability (compare with Theorem 6.27(1).) Theorem 8.9. An invertible theory α :Σ nMT Hn Ñ ΣnICˆ is stable if and only if αpSnq“ 1. The subspace of MappΣnMT Hn, ΣnICˆq consisting of theories α with αpSnq“ 1 is homotopy equivalent to the mapping space MappMT H, ΣnICˆq. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 121 We refer to [FH1, Theorem 7.22] for the obstruction theory proof. In one direction the theorem is trivial: if α extends to Σn`1MT Hn`1,then since Sn is null bordant as an Hn`1-manifold it follows that αpSnq“ 1. For the converse at the ﬁrst stage we must factor (8.10) ΣnMT Hn in \u0004\u0004 α \u0010\u0010\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f Σm`1MT Hm`1 \u0005\u0005\u0006\u0006\u0006 ΣnICˆ which we can do if and only if the restriction of α to the homotopy ﬁber of in is null homotopic. But by Proposition 8.2 that ﬁber is the base of the universal family of Hn-spheres, so the obstruction is the value of the theory on that family of spheres. The triviality is precisely the hypothesis. It turns out there are no further obstructions. Furthermore, the obstruction theory argument can be carried out all at once on the space of invertible theories, hence the second assertion in the theorem. Remark 8.11. The partition function of a stable invertible topological ﬁeld theory is a Thom bordism invariant; Theorem 8.9 reduces to Theorem 6.27(1) on the level of partition functions. (In Lecture 6 we gave a diﬀerent proof for the statement about partition functions using Morse theory.) 8.2. Equivariant spectra Our next task is to implement reﬂection structures on invertible ﬁeld theories. Recall (Deﬁnition 7.32) that a theory with reﬂection structure is a Z{2Z-equivariant functor between symmetric monoidal categories with a Z{2Z-action. In the invert- ible case (Ansatz 6.89) a theory is represented as a spectrum map, so naturally a theory with reﬂection structure is a Z{2Z-equivariant spectrum map between spectra with a Z{2Z-action. In other words, to implement reﬂection structures on invertible topological theories we work in equivariant stable homotopy theory. In this section we give a brief introduction to Borel equivariant spectra; see [FH1, §6] for a more generous exposition and [HHR, Chapter 2] and the references therein for a comprehensive development of equivariant homotopy theory. In §8.3 we im- plement complex conjugation on the codomain spectra of invertible ﬁeld theories. In §8.5 we implement the “β-involution” (7.25) on the domain bordism spectra and then deﬁne reﬂection structures. Let G be a ﬁnite group; in our application G “ Z{2Z.A (naive) G-spectrum X is a sequence X0, X1, X2,... of pointed G-spaces and equivariant maps sq : S1 ^ Xq Ñ Xq`1.Here S1 has the trivial G-action. If X, Y are G-spectra, there is a derived equivariant mapping space MapGpX, Yq of G-equivariant spectrum maps X Ñ Y; its group of path components is denoted rX, YshG. The category of G-spectra has a symmetric monoidal structure: smash product. An ordinary spectrum B de- termines a G-spectrum with trivial G-action. There are natural adjoints to this functor. First to a pointed G-space Z are associated two natural spaces. The homotopy ﬁxed point space Z hG is the space of sections of the ﬁbration (8.12) EG ˆG Z ÝÑ BG Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 122 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY with disjoint basepoint. The homotopy orbit space ZhG “ EGˆGZ L EGˆt˚u is the Borel construction with the basepoint of Z crushed to a point. We perform these space-level constructions component-wise on a G-spectrum X to obtain ordinary spectra X hG and XhG.For X a G-spectrum and B a spectrum, there are functorial weak equivalences (8.13) MapGpB, Xq» MappB, XhGq, MapGpX, Bq» MappEG` ^G X, Bq. These generalize the corresponding statements for G-spaces and express adjoint relations among functors between spectra and G-spectra. For any real linear representation ρ : G Ñ AutpV q the one-point compactiﬁca- tion SV of V is a pointed G-space. The suspension G-spectrum of SV ,also de- noted SV , is invertible under smash product. Write S´V for its inverse. Intuitively, S´V is the suspension G-spectrum associated to the virtual representation ´V . (See [FH1, Example 6.17].) Specialize to G “ Z{2Z. The ﬁxed point spectrum X hZ{2 is computed as Map Z{2ZpS0, Xq» MappBZ{2Z`, Xq » ÐÝ X _ MappBZ{2Z, Xq » ÝÑ X ˆ MappBZ{2Z, Xq, (8.14) in which the left pointing map involves a choice of a basepoint in BZ{2Z.It is the sum of the map BZ{2Z` Ñ S0 sending BZ{2Z to the non-basepoint and the map BZ{2Z` Ñ BZ{2Z which is the identity map on BZ{2Z and sends the disjoint basepoint on the left to the new basepoint on the right. Let σ be the real sign representation of Z{2Z. Deﬁne reduced virtual represen- tations (8.15) γ “ 1 ´ σ, δ “ σ ´ 1. If B is a spectrum, set (8.16) B γ “ Sγ ^ B, B δ “ Sδ ^ B. Both Sγ and Sδ are Z{2Z-equivariant reﬁnements of the sphere spectrum S0,and the induced involution on π‚S0 is inversion a ÞÑ´a in both cases. In fact, the representation sphere of any odd multiple of σ ´ 1 has the same property. These representation sphere spectra can be distinguished if we look at the induced actions on Picard q-groupoids extracted from S0. Exercise 8.17. Identify the Picard 1-groupoid πď1S0 with ZLineR, the grou- poid of Z-graded real lines (π0 – Z, π1 – Z{2Z, nontrivial k-invariant). What is the induced Z{2Z-action on ZLineR from Sγ?From Sδ? Try this exercise with other models of πď1S0,such as | Bord1pSO1q|; see Theorem 6.20. For any spectrum B there is a universal interpretation of the Z{2Z-equivariant spectrum B δ. To put it in perspective, suppose C is a symmetric monoidal category such that every object is dualizable. Implement duality as a functor C Ñ C op;it is part of a twisted Z{2Z-action on C (Theorem A.59). If C is a Picard groupoid, then we can compose with the twisted involution C op Ñ C which inverts morphisms to obtain a Z{2Z-action on C. The composed duality involution is c ÞÑ c_ on Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 123 objects and f ÞÑpf _q´1 on morphisms. The same works for Picard q-groupoids, q P Zą0 Yt8u. The geometric realization—an inﬁnite loop space, the 0-space of a spectrum—inherits an involution. Proposition 8.18. Let B be a spectrum. Then the Z{2Z-equivariant spec- trum B δ models the duality involution. See [FH1, §6.3.2] for the complete proof. As motivation, consider a (higher) Picard groupoid C.Let D be the category of pairs pc1,c2qP C ˆ C equipped with an isomorphism c1 b c2 Ñ 1. Then pc1,c2q ÞÑ c1 is an equivalence D – ÝÝÑ C.The duality Z{2Z-action is pc1,c2q ÞÑpc2,c1q.If B is a spectrum, then the spectrum which corresponds to D is the homotopy ﬁber of the product map (8.19) B _ B ÝÑ B. To compute the homotopy ﬁber, smash B with the coﬁbration (8.20) Z{2Z` ÝÑ S0 ÝÑ Sσ of pointed Z{2Z-spaces to construct a ﬁbration (8.21) B δ ÝÑ Z{2Z` ^ B ÝÑ B. This identiﬁes B δ as the equivariant homotopy ﬁber of (8.19). 8.3. Complex conjugation Our task is to implement complex conjugation on the codomain Σ nICˆ of discrete invertible ﬁeld theories (Ansatz 6.88) and on the codomain Σn`1IZp1q of their deformation classes (Theorem 6.96). Equivalently, Σn`1IZp1q is the codomain of continuous invertible ﬁeld theories (Ansatz 6.99). There is a long discussion in [FH1, §6.3.3] which explains the choices we now make; we do not reproduce it here. In the end we settle on the natural (universal) involution 68 γ “ 1 ´ σ on IZp1q: the associated equivariant spectrum is IZp1qγ. Choices of equivariant enhancements of IC ˆ and HC are made so that the exponential sequence works, but these involutions are not natural. It is easy to see why not. In terms of the polar decomposition Cˆ “ T ˆ Rą0 complex conjugation acts as inversion on T and the identity on Rą0. Hence deﬁne69 (8.22) pICˆqν 1 0 “ ITγ _ HRą0, where the second factor is a nonequivariant spectrum with trivial Z{2Z-action. The equivariant spectrum HCν 1 0 is deﬁned similarly using the product decomposition C “ Rp1qˆ R. The compatibility of these choices leads to a coﬁbration sequence (8.23) IZp1qγ ÝÑ HCν 1 0 exp ÝÝÝÑpICˆqν 1 0 68A natural involution is one which is coherently deﬁned for all spectra; see [FH1, §6.3.1]. 69The cumbersome notation ν1 0 is kept to be consistent with [FH1, §6.3.3]. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 124 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY of Z{2Z-spectra; the induced map on π0 is the exponential sequence (6.71) with involutions ? ´1 nÞÝÑ ´ ? ´1 n on Zp1q(8.24) zÞÝÑ ¯z on C (8.25) λÞÝÑ ¯λ on Cˆ(8.26) Although (8.26) is the desired complex conjugation involution, we could have achieved it by replacing γ “ 1 ´ σ with Nγ for any odd N . The motivation for N “ 1 is the discussion in §7.1: we want the composition of complex conjuga- tion and duality to have ﬁxed point spectrum equivalent to the original spectrum. This follows from Proposition 8.18, since (8.27) `I δ˘γ “ I for any spectrum I. Remark 8.28. We give another justiﬁcation for the choice of involution γ on IZp1q and the involutions on ICˆ and HC which ﬂow from it. Recall the magic revealed in Remark 6.91: the identiﬁcation of the low-lying Picard q-groupoids of ICˆ as sLineC (q “ 1) and sAlgC (q “ 2). The same identiﬁcations hold for ΣIZp1q, but with a diﬀerent topology on morphisms. We claim the involutions ν1 0 on ICˆ and γ on ΣIZp1q model complex conjugation on these Picard 1- and 2- groupoids. This is justiﬁed in [FH1, Remark 6.40] where the homotopy ﬁxed point spectra are computed and they model the real counterparts sLineR and sAlgR to sLineC and sAlgC. 8.4. Higher super lines We introduce names for the objects assigned to closed manifolds of arbitrary codimension in an invertible ﬁeld theory. In codimension 0 we have a complex number and in codimension 1 a complex Z{2Z-graded line, or in common parlance a complex super line. Hence in codimension k we introduce the term ‘complex super k-line’.70 The following deﬁnition relies on Proposition 8.18, §8.3, and §7.1. Definition 8.29. (1) IZp1q is the spectrum of higher complex super lines; (2) `IZp1qγ˘hZ{2 is the spectrum of higher real super lines; (3) IZp1qH :“pIZp1qγ ^ Sσ´1qhZ{2 is the spectrum of higher Hermitian super lines; (4) ICˆ is the spectrum of higher ﬂat complex super lines; (5) The kth space in the spectrum IZp1q is the space of complex super k-lines. In this nomenclature a complex central simple superalgebra is a complex super 2-line. The discussion in §7.1 is the motivation for (3). There are analogs of (4) and (5) for real and Hermitian super lines. For example, the ﬁxed point spectrum (8.30) ICˆ H :“ppICˆqν 1 0 ^ Sσ´1qhZ{2 70Kapranov [Kap, §3.4] suggests a higher use of ‘super’ based on the sphere spectrum. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 125 is the spectrum of higher ﬂat Hermitian super lines,and the kth space of that spec- trum is the space of ﬂat Hermitian super k-lines. As for the ﬁxed point spectrum in (3), since S1´σ ^ Sσ´1 is the sphere spectrum with the trivial Z{2-action—the “bar star” involution—we deduce from (8.14) a canonical identiﬁcation (8.31) IZp1qH “ Map `BZ{2`,IZp1q˘ . Pulling back along BZ{2 Ñ pt we obtain a map (8.32) IZp1qÝÑ IZp1qH; the image is a summand, split by a choice of point in BZ{2. Again using §7.1 as motivation, we posit the following. Definition 8.33. The image IZp1qpos of (8.32) is the spectrum of higher pos- itive deﬁnite Hermitian super lines. The kth space in IZp1qpos is the space of positive deﬁnite Hermitian super k-lines. Deﬁne the spectrum of higher ﬂat positive deﬁnite Hermitian super lines as the homotopy pullback (8.34) ICˆ pos \u0004\u0004 \u0005\u0005 ΣIZp1qpos \u0005\u0005 ICˆ H \u0004\u0004 ΣIZp1qH. We illustrate this homotopy-theoretic deﬁnition of positivity by focusing on the top piece, ﬁrst in the ungraded case and then in the Z{2Z-graded case. Example 8.35 (Hermitian lines). Consider the spectrum Σ 2HZ. Its zero-space Ω8Σ2HZ is the geometric realization of the topological groupoid of complex lines; morphisms are invertible linear maps, and morphisms sets have the continuous topology. There is a contractible space of trivializable involutions, and bar star is a point in that space. The analog of (8.31) for HZ replacing IZp1q implies that the set of components of the ﬁxed point spectrum of any such involution is (8.36) π0 MappBZ{2`, Σ2HZq“ π0Σ2HZ ‘ π0 MappBZ{2, Σ2HZq“t0u‘ Z{2. The zero-space of MappBZ{2`, Σ2HZq represents the groupoid of Hermitian lines; the Z{2Z tracks the sign of the Hermitian form. The positive subspace, obtained by pulling back along BZ{2 Ñ pt, picks out the positive deﬁnite forms. Example 8.37 (Super Hermitian lines). The zero-space of the spectrum Σ2IZp1q represents the groupoid of super lines L with continuous topology on morphisms. We compute the set of components of the ﬁxed point spectrum of a trivializable involution: (8.38) π0 MappBZ{2`, Σ2IZp1qq “ π0Σ2IZp1q‘ π0 MappBZ{2, Σ2IZp1qq “ Z{2 ‘ Z{2. This is the group of isomorphism classes of super Hermitian lines. The ﬁrst Z{2Z is the grading of the line, the second the “sign” of the form. But the sesquilinearity condition x¯ℓ1,ℓ2y“ p´1q|ℓ1||ℓ2|x¯ℓ2,ℓ1y implies that if L is odd then xℓ, ℓyP ? ´1R for all ℓ P L. The notion of positivity in this case chooses a ray in ? ´1R;there is no canonical choice. In the literature, e.g. [DM, (4.4.2)], an arbitrary choice is made. In our homotopy theoretic presentation, this choice lies in the identiﬁcation Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 126 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY of the space of super Hermitian lines with the 0-space of Σ 2IZp1q. As we descend deeper into extended ﬁeld theories, there are further choices to be made. 8.5. Spaces of invertible ﬁeld theories; extended positivity First, we implement involution (7.25) on bordism spectra. Fix a symmetry type pHn,ρnq. Recall the group co-extension (7.14) (8.39) 1 ÝÑ Hn ÝÑ pHn ÝÑ t˘1uÝÑ 1. Passing to classifying spaces we obtain the ﬁbration (8.40) BHn ÝÑ B pHn ÝÑ BZ{2Z, which induces a Z{2Z-action on BHn. Then (7.15) induces a lift to the bundle Sn Ñ BHn and so to the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum MT Hn (see Deﬁnition 6.45). We refer to [FH1, §6.2.2] for more details. Notation 8.41. Denote the spectrum MT Hn with this involution as MT H β n . Remark 8.42. We warn the reader not to confuse this notation with (8.16), which contains examples of natural involutions [FH1, §6.3.1]. The involution on the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum is geometric and speciﬁc to MT Hn, not universally deﬁned for all spectra. In fact, surely MT H β n is the geometric realization of the involution on BordnpHnq discussed at the beginning of §7.6—an equivariant version of Theorem 6.67—but we do not attempt to prove this. Ansatz 6.89 deﬁnes the space of discrete invertible n-dimensional ﬁeld theories with symmetry type pHn,ρnq as the mapping space (8.43) Iδ npHnq :“ MappΣnMT Hn , ΣnICˆq, and Ansatz 6.99 deﬁnes the space of continuous n-dimensional theories of the same type as (8.44) InpHnq :“ MappΣnMT Hn , Σn`1IZp1qq. Invertible theories with reﬂection structure form the corresponding equivariant mapping spaces: Iδ npHnqreﬂection :“ Map Z{2Z`ΣnMT H β n , pΣnICˆqν 1 0˘ (8.45) InpHnqreﬂection :“ Map Z{2Z`ΣnMT H β n , Σn`1IZp1qγ˘ (8.46) Now we implement positivity. First, positivity of an n-dimensional ﬁeld the- ory does not involve n-manifolds (numerical partition functions), but rather only depends on the truncation to an pn ´ 1q-dimensional theory whose value on an pn ´ 1q-manifold is a line.71 Recall (7.34) that the truncation of a theory with reﬂection structure assigns a Hermitian line to a closed pn ´ 1q-manifold, so to keep track of the Hermitian lines we use a truncation map (8.47) InpHnqreﬂection ÝÑ InpHn´1qHermitian into the space (8.48) InpHn´1qHermitian :“ Map `Σn´1MT Hn´1, Σn`1IZp1qH˘ 71The collection of truncations of continuous theories with reﬂection structure form the equi- variant mapping space MapZ{2Z`Σn´1MT H β n´1 , Σn`1IZp1qγ ˘. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY 127 of Hermitian pn ´ 1q-dimensional theories, which assign a Hermitian super line to a closed pn ´ 1q-manifold. (Recall Deﬁnition 8.29(3) of IZp1qH.) To construct (8.47) we transport to homotopy theory the maneuvers which lead to (7.34), particularly Proposition 7.27. The relevant move is “splitting oﬀ a reﬂection” [FH1, §8.1.1]. The splitting of interest is contained in (7.16) and exists whenever there is an “auxiliary” direction. The middle vertical homomorphism in (7.16) induces (8.49) BHn´1 ˆ BZ{2Z ÝÑ B ˆHn, which factors the projection (8.50) BHn´1 ˆ BZ{2Z ÝÑ B ˆHn ÝÑ BZ{2Z. This, in turn, gives a sequence of equivariant maps (8.51) Σn´1MT Hn´1 ^ S1´σ ÝÑ ΣnMT H β n ÝÑ MT H ^ S1´σ factoring the smash product of the identity map of S1´σ with the deﬁning inclusion of Σn´1MT Hn´1 into MT H. Pullback equivariant maps into Σ n`1IZp1qγ along the ﬁrst map in (8.51) to construct (8.47). Now we are in position to deﬁne extended positivity for invertible theories. Recall Deﬁnition 8.33 of the spectrum IZp1qpos of higher positive deﬁnite Hermitian super lines. The space (8.52) InpHn´1qpositive :“ MappΣn´1MT Hn´1 , Σn`1IZp1qposq of positive truncated theories maps into InpHn´1qHermitian. We deﬁne extended reﬂection positivity as a reﬂection structure which “is” positive, ﬁrst for the entire space of theories; the result is expressed as a ﬁber product of topological spaces. Definition 8.53. Fix n ą 0and asymmetrytype pHn,ρnq. Deﬁne the space InpHnqreﬂection positive of continuous invertible n-dimensional reﬂection positive topological ﬁeld theories with symmetry type pHn,ρnq as the homotopy pullback (8.54) InpHnqreﬂection positive \u0004\u0004 \u0005\u0005 InpHn´1qpositive \u0005\u0005 InpHnqreﬂection (8.47) \u0004\u0004 InpHn´1qHermitian The corresponding space of discrete theories is also deﬁned as a pullback, boot- strapping from the continuous case. Definition 8.55. Fix n ą 0and asymmetrytype pHn,ρnq. Deﬁne the space Iδ npHnqreﬂection positive of discrete invertible n-dimensional reﬂection positive topological ﬁeld theories with symmetry type pHn,ρnq as the homotopy pullback (8.56) Iδ npHnqreﬂection positive \u0004\u0004 \u0005\u0005 InpHnqreﬂection positive \u0005\u0005 Iδ npHnqreﬂection \u0004\u0004 InpHnqreﬂection Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 128 8. EXTENDED POSITIVITY AND STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY The theorems in the next section identify the homotopy types of InpHnqreﬂection positive and Iδ npHnqreﬂection positive . We conclude this section by re-expressing extended positivity as an additional structure on an n-dimensional invertible theory which trivializes an associated invertible pn ´ 1q-dimensional ﬁeld theory. For this we need another space of invertible ﬁeld theories, based on the target spectrum of higher real super lines (Deﬁnition 8.29(2)). Definition 8.57. The space of continuous invertible pn ´ 1q-dimensional real extended topological ﬁeld theories with symmetry type pHn´1,ρn´1q is (8.58) IR n´1pHn´1q“ Map`Σn´1MT Hn´1, pΣnIZp1qγqhZ{2˘. Recall from Remark 6.91 that the top three truncations of Σn`1IZp1q are spectra which represent the abelian group Cˆ, the Picard groupoid LineC, and the Picard 2-groupoid AlgC, respectively. (In each case Cˆ has the continuous topology.) The homotopy ﬁxed points under complex conjugation represent real versions of these groups and groupoids; see Remark 8.28. Hence for a ﬁeld theory in IR n´1pHn´1q, the partition function of a closed pn´1q-manifold lies in t˘1u, the value on a closed pn ´ 2q-manifold is a real super line, etc. To begin, for any pointed space X there is an equivalence of spectra X` « X _ S0, which leads to a coﬁbration sequence (8.59) X ÝÑ X` ÝÑ S0. Set X “ BZ{2, smash with Σn´1MT Hn´1, and apply Map `´, Σn`1IZp1q˘ to obtain the ﬁbration sequence (see [FH1, §8.1.3] for details) (8.60) InpHn´1qpositive ÝÑ InpHn´1qHermitian ÝÑ IR n´1pHn´1q. Therefore, the space InpHnqreﬂection positive may also be deﬁned as the homotopy ﬁber of the composition (8.61) κ : InpHnqreﬂection ÝÑ InpHn´1qHermitian ÝÑ IR n´1pHn´1q. This leads to the following deﬁnition. Definition 8.62. An (extended ) positivity structure on a continuous n-dimen- sional ﬁeld theory ϕ P InpHnqreﬂection is a trivialization of κpϕq. That is, a positivity structure is a path from κpϕq to the basepoint in IR n´1pHn´1q. This discussion identiﬁes the space of continuous reﬂection positive invertible ﬁeld theories as the space of continuous invertible ﬁeld theories with both a reﬂection structure and a positivity structure. Remark 8.63. The partition function of the ﬁeld theory κpϕq :Σn´1MT Hn´1 Ñ ΣnpIZp1qγqhZ{2 is the homomorphism (8.64) πn´1Σn´1MT Hn´1 ÝÑ t˘1u induced on πn´1 which tracks the sign of the Hermitian lines in the theory ϕ.The highest piece of the positivity structure is therefore the standard positivity con- straint in Deﬁnition 7.37. The theory κpϕq assigns a real super line to a closed pn ´ 2q-manifold and more complicated objects in lower dimensions; their trivial- izations are data.

Main theorems We determine the homotopy types of the spaces of reﬂection positive invertible theories, ﬁrst in the continuous case and then in the discrete case. Proofs of all theorems are in [FH1, §8]. Recall that a symmetry type pHn,ρnq stabilizes: there is a homomorphism ρ : H Ñ O and the symmetry type can be identiﬁed as pH, ρq. Deﬁne the space of stable continuous invertible n-dimensional topological ﬁeld theories of symmetry type pH, ρq as the mapping space (8.65) InpHqstable “ MappMT H, Σn`1IZp1qq. The main theorem identiﬁes its underlying homotopy type with that of reﬂection positive theories. We construct a map (8.66) InpHqstable ÝÑ InpHnqreﬂection positive using the “splitting oﬀ a reﬂection” maneuver (8.51) as follows. Map the composi- tion (8.67) Σn´1MT Hn´1 ^ BZ{2` ÝÑ Σn´1MT Hn´1 ÝÑ MT H into Σn`1IZp1q to obtain a map of InpHqstable into the northeast corner of (8.54). Use equivariant maps of the sequence (8.51) into Σn`1IZp1qγ to map InpHqstable into the southwest corner of of (8.54). The two compositions into the southeast corner are canonically homotopic, so the fact that the right square in (8.54) is a homotopy pullback yields a map (8.66). Theorem 8.68. The map InpHqstable ÝÑ InpHnqreﬂection positive in (8.66) is a homo- topy equivalence. This theorem is eﬀective in that the space of (nonequivariant) maps (8.65) is com- putable, as we illustrate in some examples in Lecture 10. Those computations only use the information about path components, which we single out next. Corollary 8.69. There is an isomorphism (8.70) π0 InpHnqreﬂection positive –rMT H, Σn`1IZp1qs. In the language of ﬁeld theory, Corollary 8.69 is a 1:1 correspondence (8.71)$ & % isomorphism classes of continuous invertible n-dimensional reﬂection positive extended topological ﬁeld theories with symmetry type pHn,ρnq , . - –rMT H, Σn`1IZp1qs. Remark 8.72. Since the rational cohomology of BH vanishes in odd degrees, elements of inﬁnite order in (8.70) occur only for n odd. Recall that the notion of a “continuous” theory (§6.10) is special to the in- vertible case. For the application to physics, we are interested in deformation classes (§6.9) of possibly non-topological invertible theories. We take up non- topological invertible theories in Lecture 9, where we motivate a closely related interpretation of the right hand side of (8.71), formulated as Conjecture 9.34. Next, we turn to discrete invertible theories. The computation of π0 is easily stated.

The image of the homomorphism (8.74) π0 Iδ npHnqreﬂection positive ÝÑ π0 InpHnqreﬂection positive is the torsion subgroup of π0 InpHnqreﬂection positive . Combining Theorem 8.73 and Corollary 8.69 we obtain the following ﬁeld theoretic classiﬁcation. Theorem 8.75. There is a 1:1 correspondence (8.76)$ & % deformation classes of invertible n-dimensional reﬂection positive extended topological ﬁeld theories with symmetry type pHn,ρnq , . - –rMT H, Σn`1IZp1qstor. ‘Tor’ denotes the torsion subgroup of the abelian group of spectrum maps. See (8.71) and Conjecture 9.34 for ﬁeld theoretic interpretations of the entire group. Finally, we determine the entire homotopy type of Iδ npHnqreﬂection positive .Note that for any n-manifold X the disjoint union βX > X is null bordant, and so in a stable theory the partition functions have unit norm, consistent with the appearance of IT in the following theorem. Theorem 8.77.

LECTURE 9 Non-Topological Invertible Field Theories Now that we have developed the ﬁeld theory ideas we need, particularly ex- tended locality and extended unitarity—the latter in the invertible case—we return to Problem 2.33. We consider, at least heuristically, a moduli space of invertible quantum mechanical systems of ﬁxed dimension and symmetry type. Since this moduli space is not a well-deﬁned mathematical object yet, we transform Prob- lem 2.33 to a classiﬁcation problem in ﬁeld theory. Recall the basic dichotomy (Remark 2.15) of quantum systems: gapped vs. gapless. The traditional view, before the advent of topological ﬁeld theory, was that the long range limit of a gapped theory is a trivial ﬁeld theory. Now it is understood that topological ef- fects survive in this limit, and they determine the deformation class of the theory; see [W4, p. 405] for an early articulation. Moreover, these topological eﬀects have strong ramiﬁcations for and constraints on the long range eﬀective ﬁeld theory. However, the expectation that the long range approximation of a gapped theory is a topological ﬁeld theory is not met in the case of 3-dimensional Yang-Mills the- ory with a Chern-Simons term, as we explain in §9.2. What we meet instead is a theory which locally factors as the tensor product of a purely topological theory with an invertible theory. In many cases the non-topological invertible theory is trivial, but in many important examples it is not. We give more perspective on the appearance of an invertible theory in Lecture 11. In §9.1 we call these possible long range limits ‘topological˚ theories’ to emphasize their topological nature. If the entire long range theory is invertible, then the ‘topological’ in ‘topological ˚’does not have any force and all we can say is that the long range theory is invertible. We give several examples of non-topological invertible theories in §9.3, where we relate them to secondary invariants in diﬀerential geometry. The modern point of view on secondary invariants is via diﬀerential cohomology, as we describe in §9.4. This discussion forms the basis of Conjecture 9.34, which extends Theorem 8.75. Some of this lecture is speculative, since we have not provided mathematical foundations. The material in §9.1 and §9.2 about the nature of long range ap- proximations to gapped theories is motivational; the parts about non-topological invertible ﬁeld theories, including Conjecture 9.34, are mathematically within reach given the existing literature on diﬀerential cohomology theories. 9.1. Short-range entangled lattice systems; topological˚ ﬁeld theories We consider lattice systems, such as the toric code (§2.3), but add a crucial hypothesis—sometimes called “short range entanglement”—which is not satisﬁed by the toric code. First, we remind that the Hilbert space of states of a lattice system is presented as a tensor product (2.21) of ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces. This displays locality in space explicitly. Some notions, such as the triviality we 131 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 132 9. NON-TOPOLOGICAL INVERTIBLE FIELD THEORIES deﬁne shortly, are deﬁned in terms of this tensor product structure. There are a few diﬀerent meanings for the term “short range entanglement” [CGW, Ki2]in the condensed matter community. We prefer the term “invertible”, which is now in wide use, since the short range entangled systems we consider are invertible under the composition law (Remark 2.14) on quantum mechanical systems, provided that we introduce an equivalence relation on lattice systems. Often the ground state, rather than the Hamiltonian, is said to determine a lattice system, and it is in these terms that we indicate the equivalence relation which deﬁnes “triviality”: a ground state is trivial if it can be transformed to a decomposable vector in the tensor product via operators (sometimes called “quantum gates”) which are local in space and in time. The composition law in this context is sometimes called “stacking”. Fix a dimension d of space and an internal symmetry group I, which we assume to be a compact Lie group. (We see below that we need to remember a bit more data attached to I.) As in §2.4 we throw out the locus of phase transitions and of gapless theories, and so we imagine a moduli space Mpd, Iq of gapped invertible lattice systems of dimension d with internal symmetry group I. It is not a mathematically well-deﬁned object. Nonetheless, Problem 2.33 asks to compute its set of path components, which is in fact an abelian group. As explained earlier, two physical principles transport us to a ﬁeld theory problem: (1) the deformation class of a quantum system is determined by its low energy behavior; (2) the low energy physics of a gapped system is well-approximated by a topological ˚ ﬁeld theory. We explain ‘topological ˚’ shortly. Since the lattice systems we envision are (i) in- vertible, (ii) local, and (iii) unitary, we expect the long range eﬀective ﬁeld theory to be so as well. Let M 1pn, Hq denote the moduli space of invertible fully extended re- ﬂection positive ﬁeld theories of spacetime dimension n and symmetry type pH, ρq. (The developments recounted in Lecture 8 give a rigorous mathematical framework for the subspace of topological theories as well as for continuous invertible theories.) The physical principles lead us to expect a map (9.1) Mpd, IqÝÑ M1pn, Hq once we match the discrete parameters pn, Hq and pd, Iq.We ﬁrst observe the following. ‚ Although we wrote a map (9.1) our expectation is that only its homo- topy class is well-deﬁned, once the moduli space Mpd, Iq is constructed: there are choices in constructing a long range eﬀective ﬁeld theory. The homotopy class of (9.1) determines a map (9.2) π0Mpd, IqÝÑ π0M 1pn, Hq on phases, and that is what we need. Should topological questions about phases arise touching on the topology of the moduli spaces beyond π0,a homotopy class of maps (9.1) will also be suﬃcient to address them. ‚ The physical principles above lead to the expectation that (9.2) is in- jective. Surjectivity is the statement that any deformation class of in- vertible theories can be realized as the long range eﬀective theory of a lattice system. There are theoretical results along these lines, for exam- ple [WW, §4], and also the agreement of homotopy theory computations Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 9. NON-TOPOLOGICAL INVERTIBLE FIELD THEORIES 133 with results in the condensed matter literature do strongly suggest that (9.2)isanisomorphism. Next, we match parameters. The dimensions are easy to match: n “ d ` 1. Next, we would like to determine a symmetry type pH, ρq from the internal symmetry group I, but the natural map is in the other direction. Recall that ρ : H Ñ O induces a homomorphism ρ : Hn Ñ On for each n, and the kernel K is the internal spacetime symmetry group, which is independent of n. The group I is the internal space symmetry group. To recover I from pHn,ρnq, ﬁx a splitting (9.3) R1,n´1 “ R1 ‘ Rn´1 of spacetime translations into the direct sum of time translations and space trans- lations. The subgroup O1 ˆ On´1 Ă O1,n´1 preserves that splitting, and the sub- group O1 ˆtiduĂ O1 ˆ On´1 is the subgroup which acts trivially on space. 72 So for the symmetry type pHn,ρnq, deﬁne the nonrelativistic internal subgroup In as the pullback (9.4) In\u0005 \u0002 \u0004\u0004 φ \u0005\u0005 Hn ρn \u0005\u0005 O1 ˆtidu\u0005 \u0002 \u0004\u0004 O1 ˆ On´1 \u0005 \u0002 \u0004\u0004 On The inclusion Hn ãÑ Hn`1 induces an isomorphism In – ÝÝÑ In`1. The colimit of the resulting directed system of groups In as n Ñ8 is the internal space symmetry group I. As an example, if pHn,ρnq“ pOn, idq then K is trivial whereas I is cyclic of order two: a reﬂection in time is internal from a space perspective, but not from a spacetime perspective. The nonrelativistic internal symmetry group In deﬁned in (9.4) comes with two additional pieces of data. First, there is the homomorphism φ : In Ñ O1 “t˘1u, a Z{2Z-grading on In which tracks whether a symmetry reverses time. Also, K “ ker φ contains the distinguished central element k0 which acts as the grad- ing operator “p´1qF ” that distinguishes bosonic and fermionic states; see Propo- sition 3.16(2). In condensed matter models the triple pIn,k0,φq is given and, to match parameters, we must construct the symmetry type pHn,ρnq of the long range eﬀective theory. The construction is explained in [FH1, Remark 9.36]. The reader 72The splitting (9.3) induces transverse aﬃne foliations of Minkowski spacetime Mn,which may be called a nonrelativistic structure. The subgroup of isometries which preserve (9.3) acts on the quotient aﬃne space Mn{R1, which is space. The vector groups in the text act on the vector space R1,n´1{R1 of spatial translations of Mn{R1.

Most of these groups appear in §3.4. Finally, and crucially, it remains to explain the meaning of topological ˚ in physical principle (2) above. The reason one expects a topological ﬁeld theory at long range in a gapped system is that the gap cleanly separates higher oscillating modes from the ground states, and so at long range one only has the ground states. At ﬁrst glance it is reasonable to postulate that the ﬁeld theory which describes the ground states is topological. But that turns out not to be quite true. There may be a non-topological invertible ﬁeld theory as well, in the sense that the long range theory is “locally” the tensor product of a topological theory and an invertible theory. In other terms, the energy-momentum tensor and currents may depend on continuous background ﬁelds—metrics and connections—but only mildly: as operators they must be multiples of the identity. (See the discussions in [GK, §1.1] and in §11.4 of these lectures.) In the invertible case this implies that we simply cross out ‘topological ˚’: the low energy theory should be invertible but not necessarily topological since (9.6) invertible topological˚ =invertible. We illustrate in §9.2 with an example from ﬁeld theory. In the invertible case there is an alternative heuristic for the low energy ef- fective ﬁeld theory. Recall that in §6.10 we introduced the notion of a continuous invertible n-dimensional topological ﬁeld theory ϕ. It assigns a Zp1q-torsor ϕpXq to a closed n-manifold X, whereas a usual discrete invertible theory F assigns a nonzero complex number F pXq. We observed that elements of Cˆ give rise to a Zp1q-torsor via the exponential sequence (6.71), so given a discrete theory F we can deﬁne ϕF pXq from F pXq. In fact, the entire discrete invertible theory F gives rise to a continuous invertible theory ϕF which encodes its deformation class. On the other hand, depending on dimension and symmetry type, there may be continuous invertible theories which do not arise from discrete invertible theories.73 One can imagine that—in this invertible case—the indeterminacy in deﬁning a low energy 73This can only happen if n is odd; see Remark 8.72. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 9. NON-TOPOLOGICAL INVERTIBLE FIELD THEORIES 135 approximation leads to a well-deﬁned isomorphism class of continuous invertible theories. Corollary 8.69, or more accurately (8.71), gives an explicit formula for the abelian group of isomorphism classes of reﬂection positive continuous invertible theories of ﬁxed dimension and symmetry type. This is the group we compute as the group of invertible gapped phases. 9.2. The long range limit of 3-dimensional Yang-Mills ` Chern-Simons Recall (Example 4.38) that in n “ 2 dimensions the Yang-Mills action only depends on the area form, but not on the full Riemannian metric. In n “ 3di- mensions the Yang-Mills action depends on the entire metric, and so the quantum theory doesnotsimplify asitdoesin n “ 2 dimensions. It is believed that pure Yang-Mills is a gapped theory in n “ 3 dimensions and, I believe, that the long range eﬀective theory is trivial. There is a special feature unique to n “ 3di- mensions, namely the possibility of an explicit mass term for the connection (gauge ﬁeld). In case the gauge group is the abelian group G “ T, the theory on Minkowski spacetime M3 is free—the 3-dimensional version of Maxwell electromagnetism—and we can compute everything explicitly. The mass term is the Chern-Simons [CS] term; see [W5, Problem FP4]. For a general compact Lie group G there is a Chern- Simons term which depends on a level λ P H 4pBG; Zp1qq. Ittoo functionsasamass if λ is nondegenerate. So the naive expectation is that the long range behavior of Yang-Mills ` Chern-Simons is governed by a topological ﬁeld theory, and naturally we expect precisely the quantum Chern-Simons theory FG,λ. The quantum Chern- Simons theory was investigated by Witten [W6] in the late 1980s and has been the catalyst for many developments in topological ﬁeld theory; see [ABHH]and the references therein. The expectation that pure Chern-Simons theory describes the long range limit has been formulated by Witten [W7], and it is perhaps one of the more mathematically interesting, yet accessible, problems about long range limits. (The corresponding problem in dimension n “ 4—no Chern-Simons term—is worth one million dollars [JW].) Let us accept that Chern-Simons theory is the long range limit of Yang-Mills ` Chern-Simons so that we can examine the formal structure. Yang-Mills ` Chern- Simons, if rigorously deﬁned in a Wick-rotated version, would be a homomorphism (9.7) FpG,λqpgq :Bordx2,3ypSO∇ 3 qÝÑ tVectC with domain the bordism category of oriented Riemannian manifolds and codomain a symmetric monoidal category of topological vector spaces. Here g P R is naively the coupling constant of the Yang-Mills action, but the 1-parameter family of quan- tum theories has a parameter with a diﬀerent description. Barring accidental sym- metry breaking or symmetry enhancement, we expect the long range approximation (9.8) FpG,λq :Bordx2,3ypSO∇ 3 qÝÑ VectC to be a theory with the same domain bordism category. Indeed, Witten [W6, §2] shows by explicit computation that the quantum Chern-Simons invariant does have a mild metric dependence. He then shows how to get a purely topological invariant by introducing a framing,74 and it is this purely topological theory on the bordism category Bordx2,3ypeq of 3-framed manifolds which has been the object of intense 74Not a full framing: a 2-framing [A2]ora p1-structure [BHMV]. Be warned that the ‘2’ in ‘2-framing’ is diﬀerent from the ‘3’ in ‘3-framing’. In the text we use 3-framings, or parallelisms, Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 136 9. NON-TOPOLOGICAL INVERTIBLE FIELD THEORIES mathematical study. But the long range limit of Yang-Mills ` Chern-Simons is the metric-dependent version (9.8) of pure Chern-Simons, which is not a topological theory.75 Remark 9.9. Observe that a 3-framing violates relativistic invariance; recall that the Wick-rotated manifestation of relativistic invariance is the statement that the image of ρ3 : H3 Ñ O3 contains SO3. We certainly do not expect the long range approximation of a quantum ﬁeld theory to break relativistic invariance. (Conversely, a basic premise of our application of ﬁeld theory to condensed matter systems is that relativistic invariance emerges in the long range approximation.) The “mildness” of the metric dependence means that the dependence is in- vertible in the following sense. Let Bordx2,3ype ∇q denote the bordism category of 3-framed Riemannian manifolds. There is a factorization of the lift of (9.8) under Bordx2,3ype ∇qÑ Bordx2,3ypSO∇ 3 q: (9.10) FpG,λq “ TpG,λq b αc :Bordx2,3ype ∇qÝÑ VectC, where TpG,λq is the purely topological framing-dependent Chern-Simons theory—it does not depend on the Riemannian metric—and αc is an invertible ﬁeld theory which is not topological—it depends on the Riemannian metric and the 3-framing. (We describe αc in Remark 9.29 below.) It is in this sense that the long range limit FpG,λq factors. We call the factorization ‘local’ since it depends on an ex- tra structure—a 3-framing compatible with the orientation—which exists and is unique76 up to a noncanonical isomorphism on an oriented ball. 9.3. Examples of non-topological invertible theories Example 9.11 (Holonomy). In Example 2.46 we use holonomy as the partition function of an invertible theory (9.12) αk :Bordx0,1ypSO1 ˆT∇qÝÑ LineC of oriented 0- and 1-manifolds equipped with a circle bundle with connection. Now we locate its deformation class in homotopy-theoretic terms. We expect its deformation class not to depend on the connection, so the domain is the Thom spectrum77 M SO ^BT` of oriented manifolds with circle bundle. The codomain in general is Σ 2IZp1q, as explained in §6.9. The Anderson dual spectrum MappM SO, Σ2IZp1qq to M SO has homotopy groups which vanish in degree ą 2, and π2 – Z, π1 “ π0 “ 0. Hence, since BT` » CP 8, (9.13) rM SO ^BT`, Σ2IZp1qs – rBT`, MappM SO, Σ2IZp1qqs – H 2pBT; Zp1qq – Zp1q, and the theory αk maps to 2πik under the isomorphism (9.13). for convenience; the theory factors through the bordism category of oriented manifolds with p1- structure. 75In these lectures we have deﬁned a theory to be topological if it factors through the bordism category with no diﬀerential structure—no metrics or connections. 76but is not a contractible choice 77The invertible theory αk is unitary, so Theorem 8.68 implies that the domain of its con- tinuous version is a Thom spectrum. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 9. NON-TOPOLOGICAL INVERTIBLE FIELD THEORIES 137 Remark 9.14. These assertions about non-topological invertible theories have the status of conjectures. In [FH1] we did not develop the mathematical infras- tructure to make them theorems. Example 9.15 (The associated continuous invertible theory). The non-topo- logical invertible ﬁeld theory αk gives rise to a continuous invertible topological theory (9.16) ϕk :Bordx0,1ypSO1 ˆTqÝÑ GerbeZp1q . The domain is the bordism category of oriented 0- and 1-manifolds equipped with a principal T-bundle (no connection). The codomain is the Picard 1-groupoid whose objects are Zp1q-gerbes and whose morphisms are isomorphism classes of gerbe isomorphisms. A Zp1q-gerbe is a groupoid on which the groupoid of Zp1q-torsors acts simply transitively. Associated to a T-torsor T is a Zp1q-gerbe whose objects are Rp1q-torsors lifting T with respect to the real exponential sequence (9.17) 0 ÝÑ Zp1qÝÑ Rp1q exp ÝÝÝÝÑ T ÝÑ 1 Then ϕkpP Ñ Y q is the Zp1q-gerbe associated to αkpP Ñ Y q,where P Ñ Y is aprincipal T-bundle over an oriented 0-manifold. The isomorphism class of the theory ϕk is an element of the abelian group (9.13); see (8.71). Also, ϕk extends to atheory ˜ϕk with domain Bordx0,1,2ypSO1 ˆTq and codomain the Picard 2-groupoid of Zp1q-gerbes. The integer-valued partition function is (9.18) ˜ϕkpP Ñ Xq“ kxc1pP q, rXsy for X a closed oriented 2-manifold. Example 9.19 (Classical Chern-Simons). Holonomy, which is the partition function of the theories in Example 9.11, is a secondary invariant of curvature. It is an example of a secondary invariant in the theory of connections. In 1973 Chern-Simons [CS] introduced a secondary invariant to the primary Chern-Weil invariants; in the simplest case it reduces to holonomy. The primary integer-valued invariants are nonzero only in even dimensions; the secondary invariants can be nonzero in any dimension. In its general form [F6, Appendix] the Chern-Simons invariant associated to a compact Lie group G and a level λ P H n`1pBG; Zp1qq is the partition function of an invertible ﬁeld theory (which in general is non-topological, but is topological if λ is ﬁnite order) (9.20) αpG,λq :Bordxn´1,nypSOn ˆG∇qÝÑ LineC . It can be fully extended to the domain BordnpSOn ˆG∇q;see [F7]. The deformation class of the fully extended theory is—conjecturally—the image of the level λ under: (9.21) H n`1pBG; Zp1qq – rBG`, Σn`1HZp1qs U ÝÝÝÑrM SO ^BG`, Σn`1HZp1qs ÝÑ rM SO ^BG`, Σn`1IZp1qs, where U is multiplication by the universal Thom class (of degree zero). Remark 9.22. Usually αpG,λq is called classical Chern-Simons theory.It is the input into the Feynman path integral which deﬁnes the quantum Chern-Simons theory (9.8). Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 138 9. NON-TOPOLOGICAL INVERTIBLE FIELD THEORIES Remark 9.23. As in Example 9.15 there is an associated continuous n-dimen- sional invertible theory ϕG,λ. It extends to an pn ` 1q-dimensional theory ˜ϕpG,λq whose Zp1q-valued partition function is the Chern-Simons primary invariant eval- uated on the fundamental class. Observe that if the level λ is nonzero and torsion in H n`1pBG; Zq, then the theory ˜ϕpG,λq is nontrivial but all of its partition func- tions vanish.78 Example 9.24 (Exponentiated η-invariants). The Chern-Weil and Chern- Simons invariants are primary and secondary invariants for Eilenberg-MacLane integral cohomology. There are also primary and secondary invariants in general- ized cohomology theories. For complex and real K-theory the primary invariants were introduced in the very ﬁrst paper on K-theorybyAtiyah-Hirzebruch [AH]; they have an analytic interpretation via the Atiyah-Singer index theorem [AS2] as Fredholm indices of elliptic operators. Atiyah-Patodi-Singer [APS] constructed the corresponding secondary invariants. These exponentiated η-invariants are the partition functions of invertible ﬁeld theories. They exist in both odd and even dimensions; in even dimensions they are necessarily ﬁnite order (roots of unity) topological invariants. For example, the signature is a primary invariant of a closed oriented 4-manifold, and there is an associated invertible ﬁeld theory (9.25) α :Bordx2,3ypSO∇ 3 qÝÑ LineC which assigns to a closed oriented Riemannian 3-manifold X its exponentiated η-invariant αpXq.The theory α is not topological; its deformation class has in- ﬁnite order. The value of α on a closed oriented Riemannian 2-manifold is the determinant line of a Dirac-type operator. In [DaFr] we deﬁne the exponentiated η-invariant of a compact 3-manifold with boundary and prove the gluing law which shows that (9.25) is a symmetric monoidal functor. There is a more reﬁned theory (9.26) α1 :Bordx2,3ypSpin ∇ 3 qÝÑ sLineC whose partition function is the secondary invariant associated to 1 2 ˆA of a closed spin 4-manifold. The value on a closed spin Riemannian 2-manifold is the super pfaﬃan line of the Dirac operator. See [FW, §3] and the references therein for a review of these geometric index theory invariants. These theories can be fully extended. The deformation class of the extended α1 is—conjecturally—the composition (9.27) M Spin [ABS] ÝÝÝÝÝÝÑ KO Pfaﬀ ÝÝÝÝÝÑ Σ4IZp1q of the Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro map from spin bordism to real K-theory and the pfaf- ﬁan map which exhibits the Anderson self-duality of KO-theory [FMS, Proposi- tion B.4], [HeSt]; see Conjecture 10.25 and Conjecture 11.23 for related assertions. Remark 9.28. These examples exemplify the need to evaluate ﬁeld theories on families of smooth manifolds. For example, the determinant and pfaﬃan line bundles of families of Dirac operators on surfaces are related to classical ϑ-and Dedekind η-functions [A3, F8]. Remark 9.29. Theinvertibletheory αc which occurs in the factorization (9.10) is the cth power of the theory (9.25), after pullback to the bordism category 78That does not occur for Cˆ-valued theories (Remark 6.91): the group Cˆ is divisible but Zp1q is not.

On a closed 3-framed Riemann- ian 3-manifold X the η-invariant has a canonical real lift ηX P R,and αcpXq“ expp2πicηX {24q. Example 9.30 (Holonomy revisited). This is a variation of Example 9.11 and is closely related to the discussion in §6.10. Let M be a smooth manifold and P Ñ M aprincipal Cˆ-bundle with connection Θ. There is an invertible ﬁeld theory79 (9.31) αpP,Θq :Bordx0,1ypSO1qrM sÝÑ LineC whose partition function on a map φ : S1 Ñ M is the holonomy of φ˚Θ. If Θ is a ﬂat connection, then αpP,Θq is a topological ﬁeld theory—it only depends on the homotopy class of the map φ—and the isomorphism class of the topological theory is the equivalence class of pP, Θq in H 1pM ; Cˆq–rM`, Σ1HCˆs –rM`, MappM SO, Σ 1ICˆqs – rM SO ^M`, Σ1ICˆs. (9.32) If, however, Θ is not ﬂat then the theory is not topological. In every case— conjecturally—the deformation class of the theory is the equivalence class of P in H 2pM ; Zp1qq – rM`, Σ2HZp1qs –rM`, MappM SO, Σ 2IZp1qqs – rM SO ^M`, Σ2IZp1qs. (9.33) This is also—rigorously—the isomorphism class of the associated continuous invert- ible 2-dimensional theory ˜ϕpP,Θq. 9.4. Diﬀerential cohomology and a conjecture For a symmetry type pHn,ρnq, Theorem 8.75 identiﬁes the torsion subgroup of rMT H, Σn`1IZp1qs in ﬁeld-theoretic terms. We ask: Identify the entire group in ﬁeld-theoretic terms. One solution is (8.71), but we prefer ﬁeld-theoretic concepts not particular to the invertible case, which continuous theories are. It is typical in derived geometry, say in enumerative problems, that the natural object one ends up enumerating is larger than originally envisioned. We encountered an algebraic example in Remark 6.76. Motivated by this experience and by the examples in §9.3, we formulate a conjectural answer to our query. Conjecture 9.34. There is a 1:1 correspondence (9.35)$ & % deformation classes of invertible n-dimensional reﬂection positive extended ﬁeld theories with symmetry type pHn,ρnq , . - –rMT H, Σn`1IZp1qs. As compared with (8.76) we have dropped ‘topological’ on the left hand side and ‘tor’ on the right hand side. We have in mind a more precise statement—a speciﬁc map which exhibits the isomorphism. To formulate it we introduce diﬀerential cohomology. 79The (temporary) hybrid notation evokes the bordism category of oriented 0- and 1- manifolds equipped with a smooth map to M . To be consistent with (3.2) we would use ‘Bordx0,1ypBSO1 ˆ M q’. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 140 9. NON-TOPOLOGICAL INVERTIBLE FIELD THEORIES Let us pick up the discussion in Example 9.30, only replace Cˆ with the circle group T.If M is a smooth manifold, let Bun∇ T pM q denote the groupoid of principal T-bundles P Ñ M with connection; a morphism is a ﬂat bundle isomorphism ϕ : P 1 Ñ P which covers idM ,that is, ϕ pulls the connection on P back to the connection on P 1.Then π0 Bun ∇ T pM q is the abelian group of isomorphism classes of principal T-bundles with connection. It is a discrete group. Analogous to the discussion around (6.75), we can topologize it as an inﬁnite dimensional abelian real Lie group A.Then (9.36) π0A – H 2pM ; Zp1qq π1A – H 1pM ; Zp1qq Lie A – Ω1 M {dΩ0 M and the exact sequence (6.75) holds. The curvature is a Lie group homomorphism (9.37) ω : A ÝÑ Ω2 M,closed to the vector space of closed 2-forms, and the image is a disjoint union of aﬃne subspaces indexed by the lattice H 2pM ; Zp1qq{torsion. The group H 1pM ; Tq of isomorphism classes of ﬂat T-connections can be topologized as a ﬁnite dimensional Lie subgroup of A. Its identity component T “ H 1pM ; Rp1qq{H 1pM ; Zp1qq is a torus, and the curvature map (9.37) exhibits each component of A as a principal T -bundle over an aﬃne translate of dΩ1 M . The curvature and path component maps ﬁt into the commutative diagram (9.38) A ω \u0004\u0004 π0 \u0005\u0005 Ω2 M,closed \u0005\u0005 H 2pM ; Zp1qq \u0004\u0004 H 2pM ; Rp1qq which is not a pullback square: the kernel of π0ˆω can be identiﬁed with the torus T of ﬂat connections on the trivial bundle. As an extreme example, for M “ S1 the diagram (9.38) is (9.39) T \u0004\u0004 \u0005\u0005 0 \u0005\u0005 0 \u0004\u0004 0 Example 9.40. Repeat the discussion one degree lower. What replaces Bun ∇ T pM q? The sense in which (9.38) is a pullback square is the starting point for Hopkins- Singer’s work [HS] on generalized diﬀerential cohomology. Namely, (9.38) is a homotopy pullback square. An element of A can be represented by a triple pc, h, ωq in which c is an integral singular 2-cocycle, ω is a closed 2-form, and h is a real 1-cochain such that (9.41) δh “ ω ´ c. The homotopy pullback remembers the homotopy h between c and ω, so the homo- topy pullback is a categoriﬁcation of the ordinary pullback. As a ﬁrst generaliza- tion we can replace ‘2’ by any degree q P Zě0 and so obtain diﬀerential cohomology groups qH qpM q which generalize qH 2pM q– π0 Bun ∇ T pM q. They also have a Lie Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 9. NON-TOPOLOGICAL INVERTIBLE FIELD THEORIES 141 group topology with analogs of (9.36)–(9.38). These groups were ﬁrst introduced by Cheeger-Simons [CheeS], who call their elements ‘diﬀerential characters’, a term which refers to the generalization (9.43) of the holonomy map to arbitrary q.The homotopy pullback viewpoint leads to: ‚ a cocycle theory and a Picard pq´1q-groupoid which generalizes Bun ∇ T pM q in case q “ 2 ‚ generalized diﬀerential cohomology theories and higher groupoids for ar- bitrary spectra These ideas have been developed in many directions; see [BG] and the references therein. There is an integration theory for diﬀerential cohomology. Let R be a ring spectrum, or a module over a ring spectrum. For an appropriately80 (diﬀerential) oriented proper ﬁber bundle π : M Ñ S of smooth manifolds, there is a pushforward (9.42) π˚ : qRqpM qÝÑ qRq´npSq, where n “ dim M {S. The generalization of holonomy referenced above is the map (9.43) π˚ : qH n`1pM qÝÑ qH 1pptq– Rp1q{Zp1q, where M is a closed oriented smooth n-manifold. In the case of diﬀerential K- theory, if M is a closed odd-dimensional spin Riemannian manifold, then the push- forward (9.44) π˚ : qK n`1pM qÝÑ qK 1pptq– Rp1q{Zp1q can be proved to equal the η-invariant of the Dirac operator modulo integers; see [Klo, O, FL]. (Recall that in Example 9.24 we encountered its exponential as the partition function of an invertible ﬁeld theory.) These integrals may be carried out over lower dimensional manifolds; the values of such pushforwards live in higher degree diﬀerential cohomology groups [HS, Theorem 2.17]. If we start with a map MT H Ñ Σn`1IZp1q for some symmetry type pHn,ρnq, then we fully expect that these integrals of a “geometric representative of a diﬀerential lift” ﬁt together into an invertible ﬁeld theory whose codomain is the diﬀerential extension of Σn`1IZp1q. This should deﬁne a map from the right hand side of (9.35) to the left hand side. It will be interesting to develop these ideas into mathematical theorems. 80If R is the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum HZ, the the appropriate orientation is a usual orientation. If R is the real K-theory spectrum KO, then the appropriate orientation is a spin structure. If R is the complex K-theory spectrum K, then the appropriate orientation is a Spinc- structure; in the diﬀerential case it is a Spinc-connection.

LECTURE 10 Computations for Electron Systems We are ready to apply Conjecture 9.34 to compute the classiﬁcation of gapped phases of invertible lattice systems. We remind the reader that this application relies on several heuristics to pass from lattice systems to ﬁeld theories; we have no mathematical justiﬁcation for this passage. Problem 2.33 with surrounding text and §9.1 are our quick summaries of the problem and of the heuristics we use to arrive at a problem in ﬁeld theory. We are unaware of any rigorous mathematical framework for invertible lattice systems which allows us to pass to the low energy eﬀective invertible ﬁeld theories, as we do here. The issue is discussed at greater length in various places, such as [Ki2, Ki5, G]; see also the discussion in [Sa]from this CBMS conference as well as the examples in §2.3 and the references therein. For our purposes we simply accept that invertible lattice systems are well-approximated at long range by an invertible ﬁeld theory, that every invertible ﬁeld theory is so realized, and that the low energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory determines the deformation class of the lattice system. Thus empowered, for each dimension and symmetry type we can compute the right hand side of (9.35) using homotopy theory methods and compare to results in the condensed matter literature. The successful comparisons provide strong evidence for the leap from lattice systems to ﬁeld theories and focus attention on the problem of building a mathematical theory for that jump. Even better, our general formula—which holds for all dimensions and symmetry types— predicts classiﬁcation results for lattice systems which do not appear in the physics literature. To better test the entire picture, we choose a class of systems—electron systems—on which there are two classiﬁcations and a map between them. Namely, there are both free systems and interacting systems. Freeness is not a concept we deﬁne in terms of Axiom System 3.1. Rather, for free fermions we use the semi- classical description in relativistic ﬁeld theory, and develop a conjecture for the deformation class of the long range theory in the massive case, since massive free fermion theories are gapped. Note that the general theory we describe in these lectures is for interacting systems. The semiclassical theory we use in the free case is essentially the theory of Lorentz signature spin representations, or Cliﬀord mod- ules. Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro [ABS] pioneered the relation to K-theory and we use two aspects of their work: (i) the identiﬁcation of the group of Cliﬀord modules modulo restrictions of higher Cliﬀord modules with K-theory groups, and (ii) the map from spin bordism to K-theory given by the symbol of the Dirac operator. We set out this picture in §10.2. We begin in §10.1 by determining symmetry types of free electron systems. We make two simple hypotheses from which straightforward arguments with compact Lie groups result in 10 distinguished symmetry types. Here again we experience the power of Wick rotation, which transforms noncompact Lie groups to compact 143 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 144 10. COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS Lie groups, which are rigid and lead to relatively easy classiﬁcation theorems. The resulting 10-fold way has many incarnations in quantum mechanics; the original papers are [D, AZ, HHZ]. Here we ﬁnd a relativistic 10-fold way. These 10 elec- tron symmetry groups embed into Cliﬀord algebras, which leads to a simultaneous treatment of all cases. In §10.3 we report on computations from [FH1, §§9–10] and compare with results in the condensed matter literature. Our theory is conﬁrmative and pre- dictive. The computations based on Conjecture 9.34 are carried out using the Adams spectral sequence, which was developed in the 1960s without any thought of statistical mechanical models. Conversely, the results in the condensed matter literature to which we compare are derived without any thought of homotopy the- ory. The simultaneous disjunction of techniques and concurrence of results provide a powerful test for our analysis based on Axiom System 3.1 and its variations. There have been several other conﬁrmations of these ideas. Kapustin and collabo- rators made comparisons for several symmetry types, both bosonic and fermionic; see [Ka3, KTTW] for a small sample. Campbell [Cam] makes new computations for more elaborate symmetry types. Beaudry-Campbell [BeCa] give a pedagog- ical introduction to the Adams spectral sequence, and they and [Cam] include details of the computations in [FH1], including those discussed here in §9.3. Ap- pendix D in [FH1] exposes further techniques around the Adams spectral sequence. The recent paper of Guo-Putrov-Wang [GPW] undertakes computations for more fermionic symmetry types related to the 10-fold way. 10.1. The 10-fold way for free electron systems Recall that a symmetry type pH, ρq has an associated internal symmetry group K, which is a compact Lie group, and a special element k0 P K which satisﬁes k2 0 “ 1; see Proposition 3.16. For each positive integer n there is a canonical homomorphism Spinn Ñ Hn which sends the central element ´1 P Spinn to k0 P K Ă Hn. In relativistic ﬁeld theory on Minkowski spacetime there is a super Hilbert space H “ H0 ‘ H1 of states and k0 acts as the grading operator. 81 To model free fermions we impose two conditions: (10.1) ‚ K “ O1,U1,or Sp1 ‚ k0 “´1 These three internal symmetry groups K, which we denote t˘1u, T, SU2,are the unitnormelementsin R, C, H. Anti-Wick rotating again to Minkowski space- time, an internal symmetry group K acts on H preserving the grading, and it decomposes a dense subspace of H as a direct sum indexed by irreducible repre- sentations of K. States in an isotypical summand have a deﬁnite charge labeled by the representation. For K “ T thechargeis e P Z if the representation of T is λ ÞÑ λe. This is the basic case: e is the electric charge. The second condi- tion imposes the spin/charge relation, emphasized in [SeWi]: states of even charge are bosons and states of odd charge are fermions. One can imagine motivating the internal symmetry groups K “t˘1u, SU2 by considering a charge conjugation 81In the physics literature it is often denoted p´1qF to evoke the number of fermions mod 2. In a system of free fermions, F is a well-deﬁned unbounded self-adjoint operator, and this justiﬁes the notation.

COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS 145 symmetry—implemented by the outer automorphism λ ÞÑ λ´1 of T—which sends e ÞÑ´e. That could “break” T to the ﬁxed point subgroup t˘1uĂ T or enhance 82 it to SU2. One could also contemplate arguing that the R, C, H trichotomy enters in various ways, for example as the commuting algebra of an irreducible real spin representation. We do not have a convincing argument to restrict to these internal symmetry groups to model interacting83 fermionic systems, and indeed physicists consider more possibilities [GPW]. Once we settle on the restrictions (10.1), it is a routine matter to classify the possible symmetry types. The following is proved in [FH1, §9.1]. Theorem 10.2. There are 10 symmetry types pH, ρq with internal symmetry group K “t˘1u, T,or SU2 and whose special element k0 P K equals ´1.The groups H are: (10.3) K “t˘1u : Spin, Pin`, Pin ´ K “ T : Spinc, Pin c, Pin˜c`, Pin˜c´ K “ SU2 : Spin ˆt˘1u SU2, Pin` ˆt˘1u SU2, Pin ´ ˆt˘1u SU2 The exotic groups for K “ T are (10.4) Pin˜c˘ “ Pin ˘ ˙t˘1uT, where Pin˘ acts on T through π0 Pin ˘ via λ ÞÑ λ´1, and we divide by the common subgroup t˘1u of Pin ˘ and T to enforce the spin/charge relation. Remark 10.5. The 10-fold way was introduced by Altland-Zirnbauer [AZ]in condensed matter physics; see also [HHZ]. There is a 10-fold way in the famous 1962 paper of Dyson [Dy], despite the title only emphasizing a quotient 3-fold way. Several quantum mechanical 10-fold ways exist (see [FM1, Mo]and the references therein), and the relations among them are not completely understood. Theorem 10.2 is yet another perspective to reconcile. Remark 10.6. Electron systems with K “ T are called topological insulators; those with K “t˘1u, SU2 are called topological superconductors.For some back- ground on superconductors and symmetry, see [Wei2]. Just as SOn sits in the algebra MnpRq of real n ˆ n matrices, its double cover Spinn sits in a unital associative algebra, a Cliﬀord algebra. The standard representation Rn of SOn extends to an MnpRq-module, and so too spinor repre- sentations of Spinn extend to Cliﬀord modules. (In fact, spinor representations are characterized by that property.) Each of the 10 groups in Theorem 10.2 embeds in a Cliﬀord algebra, which gives a notion of spinor representation for each and leads to a uniform and simultaneous treatment. For p, q P Zě0 let Cliﬀ p,q be the real uni- tal associative algebra generated by e ` 1 ,... ,e ` p ,e ´ 1 ,... ,e ´ q subject to pe ˘ i q2 “˘1 and distinct generators commute up to a minus sign. (More generally, we can de- ﬁne the Cliﬀord algebra of a vector space with a symmetric bilinear form.) Set 82One could argue that the enhancement is more straightforwardly the semidirect product t˘1u˙ T. 83In the free case the embedding (10.9) into a Cliﬀord algebra is tied up with the R, C, H trichotomy and provides stronger motivation for restriction to K “t˘1u, T, SU2.

COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS Cliﬀ `p “ Cliﬀ p,0 and Cliﬀ ´q “ Cliﬀ 0,q.

Namely, in the real case (10.8), there is an embedding (10.9) Hnpsq ãÝÑ Cliﬀ `n bDpsq. The codomain is a Cliﬀord algebra. In fact, (10.9) exhibits the compact Lie group Hnpsq as a Lie subgroup of a spin group which is not necessarily compact. For example, we have (10.10) Pin´ n Ă Spinn`1 Pin` n Ă Spinn,1 The ﬁrst spin group is compact, the second noncompact, though of course Pin` n is compact. We defer to [FH1, §9.2.1] for details and proofs as well as the analog of (10.9) in the complex case (10.7). 10.2. The long range eﬀective theory of free fermions As an illustration we begin with the 1-dimensional case with symmetry type 85 H1 “ Spin1. Example 10.11 (Spinor ﬁelds in dimension one). The data which deﬁnes the theory is a ﬁnite dimensional real inner product space W .If X is a spin Riemannian 1-manifold with spin bundle of frames the double cover rX t˘1u ÝÝÝÝÑ X, a spinor ﬁeld is a t˘1u-equivariant function ψ : rX Ñ ΠW ,where ΠW is the purely odd vector space 84As suggested by Remark 10.5, that comparison is not completely straightforward. 85We may identify a symmetry type pHn,ρnq by its symmetry group Hn when the homo- morphism ρn : Hn Ñ On is unambiguous.

COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS 147 Codd b W parity opposite to W .A mass term is a nondegenerate skew-symmetric form (10.12) m : W ˆ W ÝÑ R, which exists if and only if dim W is even. There is a unit norm positively oriented vector ﬁeld B on X with a unique lift to rX, and the Wick-rotated lagrangian density with mass term m is (10.13) L “ ! 1 2 xψ, Bψy` 1 2 mpψ, ψq) |dx|. Let us extract the low energy theory. Working ﬁrst on real time M1 we identify the space of classical solutions 86 as ΠW after ﬁxing a particular time t0 P M1;see the bosonic analog in §2.2. The Hilbert space of states is an irreducible complex CliﬀpW ˚q-module H “ H0‘H1. Identify (10.12) with an element Tm P opW q in the orthogonal Lie algebra. Then the Hamiltonian is, up to a factor of ?´1, the action of Tm on H. For example, let W “ R2 with m “ ` 0 ´M M 0 ˘ and Tn “ M 2 e 1e 2 P Cliﬀ C 2 . Then H “ C ‘ C is an irreducible Cliﬀord module and the Hamiltonian is (10.14) H “ ˆ M {2 ´M {2 ˙ . We are faced with a choice: Is the vacuum line even or odd? We defer a de- tailed discussion of this choice to §11.4, particularly Example 11.36. For now we choose the vacuum to be odd. Next, the vacuum energy is not zero. Eval- uate the Wick-rotated theory on a Riemannian interval of length τ .The result is the operator e´τH : H Ñ H.Since τ Ñ8 is the long range limit, make a constant shift H Ñ H ` M {2 of the energy operator; then e´τ pH`M {2q con- verges to projection onto the vacuum as τ Ñ8. We can also perform the path integral on a spin circle of circumference τ , and the result is the (super)trace of the Wick-rotated time evolution. For the nonbounding spin structure, be- fore shifting the energy operator we obtain trs e ´τH “´2 sinhp τH 2 q, but if we shift H Ñ H ` M {2thentrs e ´τ pH`M {2q “ e ´τM ´ 1 which converges to ´1 as τ Ñ8. For the bounding spin structure of circumference τ , the shifted par- tition function is tr e ´τ pH`M {2q “ e ´τM ` 1 which converges to `1as τ Ñ8. (See [W5, Problem FP16] for a careful treatment of the quantization and path integrals, but in the massless case.) Summarizing, the low energy theory (10.15) α :Bord1pSpin1qÝÑ sLineC is topological, invertible, reﬂection positive, and has order two: αb2 is trivial. It sends (10.16) pt` ÞÝÑ Codd S1 bounding ÞÝÑ ´1 S1 nonbounding ÞÝÑ `1 as deduced above. In homotopy theoretic terms the low energy theory is a map (10.17) α : MT Spin ÝÑ Σ1ICˆ in the nonzero homotopy class, which corresponds to the nontrivial character of π1MT Spin – Z{2Z. 86That is, solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation derived from the lagrangian (10.13).

COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS There is a conjectural picture in general dimensions which applies to all 10 elec- tron symmetry types. We outline it for the standard case H “ Spin. To begin, the classiﬁcation of relativistic free fermion systems relies on special facts about spinors in Lorentz signature [De, §6]. Let n ě 1 be the dimension of spacetime, C Ă R1,n´1 the cone of positive timelike vectors, and87 Spin1,n´1 Ă Cliﬀ 0 n´1,1 the Lorentz spin group. By deﬁnition, a real spin representation S is a real (ungraded) Cliﬀ 0 n´1,1- module. There are two isomorphism classes of irreducibles if n ” 2 pmod 4q and a unique irreducible otherwise. The following theorems hold: ‚ If S is irreducible, then there is a unique-up-to-scale nonnegative Spin1,n´1- invariant symmetric bilinear pairing (10.18) Γ : S ˆ S ÝÑ R 1,n´1, where nonnegativity means Γps, sqP C for all s P S. ‚ Let S1,S2 be representative irreducibles (S2 “ 0if n ı 2 pmod 4q), and let Z “ R, C,or H be the commutant of the Cliﬀord action. Then any spin representation has the form (10.19) S “ W1 bZ S1 ‘ W2 bZ S2. In addition, nonnegative pairings (10.18) are in bijection with pairs of Hermitian metrics on the Z-vector spaces W1,W2. ‚ Given a pairing Γ there is a unique compatible Cliﬀ n´1,1-module structure on S ‘ S ˚. ‚ Every ﬁnite dimensional Cliﬀ n´1,1-module is of the form (10.19). These theorems reduce the classiﬁcation of relativistic free fermion systems to the study of Cliﬀord modules. A mass term for S is a nondegenerate skew-symmetric Spin1,n´1-invariant bi- linear form (10.20) m : S ˆ S ÝÑ R. The following lemma [FH1, Lemma 9.55] is crucial. Lemma 10.21. Nondegenerate mass terms for a spinor representation S corre- spond to Cliﬀ n´1,2-module structures on S ‘ S ˚ whichextendthe Cliﬀ n´1,1-module structure. Remark 10.22. Free fermion theories in dimension n have an associated in- vertible anomaly theory which is pn ` 1q-dimensional. The anomaly of a massive free fermion is trivial, so the anomaly only depends on the Cliﬀ n´1,1-module mod- ulo Cliﬀ n´1,2-modules, which according to [ABS]isa KO-group. The deformation class of the anomaly theory is computed similarly to (10.26), as we explain in Lec- ture 11. Our task now is to identify the low energy theory of a massive free fermion ﬁeld theory, at least up to deformation. Cliﬀord module data deﬁnes the the- ory, as just explained. The low energy approximation is an invertible unitary ﬁeld theory, so is realized as a map from the Thom spectrum MT Spin to the shifted Anderson dual of the sphere spectrum. In other words, we seek a general- ization of Example 10.11 to arbitrary spacetime dimension n. Fix massive spinor 87Cliﬀ 0 n´1,1 Ă Cliﬀ n´1,1 is the even subalgebra.

COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS 149 data: a real Cliﬀ n´1,1-module S, a nonnegative pairing Γ, and a mass term m. According to Lemma 10.21 we obtain a Cliﬀ n´1,2-module S ‘ S ˚. Atiyah-Bott- Shapiro [ABS] identify the quotient group of Cliﬀ n´1,2-modules by restrictions of Cliﬀ n´1,3-modules with KOpn´1q´2pptq– π3´nKO. So the massive spinor data 88 pS,mq has an equivalence class (10.23) rS,msP π3´nKO –rS0, Σn´3KOs. The symbol of the Dirac operator—Cliﬀord multiplication—deﬁnes the Atiyah- Bott-Shapiro map (10.24) φ : M Spin ÝÑ KO from spin bordism to real K-theory. Let μ : KO ^ KO Ñ KO be multiplication on real K-theory. A choice of generator in π´4KO – Z determines a map S´4 Ñ KO, up to homotopy, and dually a map KO Ñ Σ4IZp1q. We call the latter ‘Pfaﬀ’; see §11.3 for nomenclature explication. The following conjecture is in [FH1, §9.2.6]. Conjecture 10.25. (1) The long range approximation to the massive free fermion theory based on pS,mq is invertible, and it is trivial if S‘S˚ extends to a Cliﬀ n´1,3-module. (2) The deformation class of the long range approximation is the composition (10.26) MT Spin φ^rS,ms ÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÑ KO ^ Σn´3KO μ ÝÝÑ Σn´3KO Pfaﬀ ÝÝÝÝÝÑ Σn`1IZp1q. The map (10.26) may have ﬁnite or inﬁnite order, so may or may not represent a topological theory. There is an analog of Conjecture 10.25 for each of the 10 electron symmetry types; see [FH1, (9.71)]. We use this generalization to compute the tables in Examples 10.30 and 10.32 below. Remark 10.27. Conjecture 10.25 relies on ﬁxing indeterminacies in the con- struction of the free fermion quantum ﬁeld theory from the algebraic data. See §11.4 for a general discussion of these indeterminacies and Example 11.36 for the partic- ular canonical choices available for a free massive spinor ﬁeld. These choices are implicit in Conjecture 10.25. Remark 10.28. Many special low dimensional examples are treated in detail in [W8]. 10.3. Computations The group (8.76) of deformation classes of invertible n-dimensional theories 89 of symmetry type pH, ρq sits in the exact sequence (6.82): (10.29) 0 ÝÑ Ext 1pπnMT H, ZqÝÑrMT H, Σn`1IZp1qs ÝÑ Hompπn`1MT H, ZqÝÑ 0 The free quotient Hompπn`1MT H, Zq only depends on the free quotient of πn`1MT H, and at least its rank can be computed by tensoring over Q.Now πn`1MT H b Q – H n`1pMT H; Qq, so the Thom isomorphism theorem reduces us to the (twisted) rational cohomology of the classifying space BH.In particular, this group vanishes if n ` 1 is odd, hence for n even the group rMT H, Σn`1IZp1qs 88Since Γ is a contractible choice, we omit it from the notation henceforth. 89assumed fully extended and reﬂection positive Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 150 10. COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS is torsion. The torsion subgroup Ext 1pπnMT H, Zq depends only on the torsion subgroup of πnMT H. The Adams spectral sequence can be brought to bear to compute it. We remark that the group rMT H, Σn`1IZp1qs of interest is a general- ized cohomology group of MT H, and in some cases it can be computed more easily using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. As mentioned earlier, the papers [Cam, BeCa] give extensive expositions of the computational techniques. Further information is in [FH1, Appendix D]. We content ourselves with just two examples of the electron system computa- tions reported in [FH1, §9.3]. Example 10.30 (H “ Pin`). Consider ﬁrst the symmetry type H “ Pin`. This is the Wick-rotated version of a fermionic system with time-reversal symme- try T such that T 2 is the central element k0 of the Lorentz signature spin group, which in view of the spin-statistics theorem is often expressed as T 2 “p´1qF ; see (3.23). Here is the table of computations: (10.31) n ker Φ ÝÑ FFnpPin `q Φ ÝÝÝÑ TPnpPin `qÝÑ coker Φ 416ZZ Z{16Z 0 30 Z{2ZZ{2Z 0 20 Z{2ZZ{2Z 0 10 0 0 0 02ZZ Z{2Z 0 The column labeled ‘FFnpPin `q’ is the group of free theories, which we argued in §10.2 is an appropriate homotopy group of KO. (The exposition in §10.2 is for H “ Spin; the other 7 real electron symmetry types lead to a shift of KO by the index s in (10.8).) We see the familiar lyrics of the Bott song in that column. The column labeled ‘TPnpPin `q’ is the abelian group of invertible interacting theories, which is computed as the right hand side of (8.76) in Theorem 8.75. These groups are all ﬁnite order in this case, so they represent isomorphism classes of invertible topological theories. ‘TP’ stands for ‘topological phases’. The TP groups are all torsion, so are character groups of tangential Pin` bordism groups. Tangential Pin ` bordism was computed in all dimensions in [KT2] based on the structure of Spin and Pin ´ bordism determined in [ABP1, ABP2]; see [KT1]forageometric account of all of these bordism groups in low dimensions. The map Φ tells the deformation class of a free fermion system, which is the (twisted version of) (10.26) in Conjecture 10.25. The kernel of Φ is the subgroup of free theories which are deformable to the trivial phase if interactions are allowed. The cokernel of Φ is the quotient group of all phases by those which can be represented by free fermions. For this particular symmetry type there are no such. Now we compare to the physics literature. Kitaev [Ki3] derived the classiﬁca- tion of free fermions in the context of lattice systems, and he made the connection with Bott periodicity. The FF column matches those results for this, and in fact for all 10, electron symmetry types. There are many arguments in the physics liter- ature demonstrating that 16 copies of the basic free fermion theory in 4 dimensions has a trivial phase once interactions are allowed, and that this does not occur with fewer copies. A sample of the literature includes [Ki2, FCV, WS, MFCV, Ki4] Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 10. COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS 151 and [W8, §4]. The interacting case in 3 dimensions is investigated in [W8, §3], and various aspects of the invertible ﬁeld theory are described explicitly. It is also dis- cussed in [LV, §V B], but the nonzero element is missed within the “K-formalism” as the authors explain. Again, we emphasize that the arguments in these physics papers are completely disjoint from our reasoning based on the Axiom System for ﬁeld theory, which ultimately leads us to computations in stable homotopy theory. The groups TPnpPin `q as computed here also appear in [KTTW, Table 2]. Example 10.32 (H “ Pin˜c`). At the end of [M, §VI]Metlitskiraised the question of determining TP4pPin˜c`q by a bordism computation and checking agree- ment with [WPS]. This symmetry type corresponds to lattice systems whose in- ternal symmetry group from the viewpoint of space (as opposed to spacetime) is Z{2Z˙T, as deduced using (9.4). The identity component T is the symmetry group associated with electric charge. An element in the oﬀ-component of Z{2Z ˙ T acts as time-reversal and squares to the identity. The classiﬁcation problem for topo- logical phases of these particular free electron systems—topological insulators with time-reversal symmetry—has attracted wide attention [KMo] in the physics com- munity. Here is the table of computations: (10.33) nker Φ ÝÑ FFnpPin˜c`q Φ ÝÝÝÑ TPnpPin˜c`qÝÑ coker Φ 40 Z{2Z pZ{2Zq3 pZ{2Zq2 30 Z{2ZZ{2Z 0 20 0 0 0 10 ZZ 0 00 0 Z{2ZZ{2Z Again we see a slice of the Bott song in the free fermion column FF, now shifted from (10.31). The Z{2Z invariant of free fermion systems in 3 and 4 spacetime di- mensions was introduced in papers of Kane-Mele [KM] and Fu-Kane-Mele [FKM] and has been further studied by many authors. The interacting case in 4 dimen- sions is investigated in [WPS] and in 3 dimensions in [W8, §3.7]; their results agree with ours. Not only are the abstract groups correct, but so is the map from free fermions. Even more, the description of the partition function of some phases in terms of Stiefel-Whitney classes matches our bordism computations as well. Also, [W8, §4.7] treats the invertible topological ﬁeld theory in 4 dimensions deﬁned by the free fermion theory. 10.4. Conclusions As stated several times in these lectures, we use heuristic arguments to pass from lattice systems to ﬁeld theory; the agreement of our computations with physics arguments based more directly on lattice systems is evidence that these heuristics are valid. But much more has to work. In fact, these computations provide a Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 152 10. COMPUTATIONS FOR ELECTRON SYSTEMS serious test of Axiom System 3.1 against physics. 90 There are many aspects of this Axiom System, and its extensions, which are being tested here: (1) Wick-rotated ﬁeld theory on compact manifolds detects long range behav- ior. After all, ‘long range’ seems contrary to restriction to compact man- ifolds. In a scale-dependent theory we might imagine that scaling up the metric we can capture long range behavior without passing to noncom- pact manifolds. Certainly bordism groups are deﬁned in terms of compact manifolds, and we were led to these computations from the Axiom Sys- tem, which encodes Wick-rotated ﬁeld theory on compact manifolds. This is a direct demonstration that the Axiom System does capture long range phenomena using compact manifolds. (2) Extended locality is properly encoded. Extended locality is the subject of Lecture 5. We are led to higher categories and the Extended Ax- iom System 5.21. In the invertible case a theory is equivalently a map of spectra (Ansatz 6.89), and ultimately that is the framework for the computations which agree with the physics results. (Some have argued that non-extended ﬁeld theory suﬃces—see [Yo], for example—and in- deed since our choice of target spectrum is based on the principle that the partition function determines the theory, that is true in some sense. How- ever, locality is one of the pillars of quantum theory, and not only is the extended version is much more powerful than the non-extended version, but it is widely used in both mathematics and physics. As we pointed out in §5.4, one manifestation in physics is extended operators. If the mathe- matical framework for extended locality were oﬀ, then the computations might not have come out correctly.) (3) Extended reﬂection positivity for invertible topological theories is properly implemented. Unitarity is the other pillar of quantum ﬁeld theory. In Lec- ture 8 we motivated and executed a deﬁnition of Wick-rotated extended unitarity for invertible topological ﬁeld theories. That brought us from Madsen-Tillmann spectra to Thom spectra. The computations depend on the precise spectrum, and so provide a test of this aspect of our story as well. 90The utility of this axiomatic viewpoint on ﬁeld theory for mathematics, as opposed to physics, is well-established by its many applications to low-dimensional topology, symplectic ge- ometry, algebraic geometry, geometric representation theory, etc. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. LECTURE 11 Anomalies in Field Theory Anomalies in quantum ﬁeld theory were discovered in perturbation theory in work of Steinberger, Schwinger, Adler, Bell-Jackiw, Bardeen, Zee, Wess-Zumino, ’t Hooft, and many others. We refer to the books [B, FS] for exposition as well as history and references. A more geometric point of view developed beginning in the 1980s, and that is our theme in this lecture. Formulas for anomalies were connected [AgW, AgG] to the Atiyah-Singer index formulas [AS3]for a single elliptic operator. At the same time Atiyah-Singer put forward [AS4] a relationship to their index theorem [AS5]for families of Dirac operators. (All of this takes place in the Wick-rotated theory on compact manifolds.) Global anomalies which are not detected in perturbation theory were also discovered [DJT, W9], and Witten computed [W10] a formula for the global anomaly in terms of Atiyah-Patodi- Singer η-invariants [APS]. We focus on anomalies involving spinor ﬁelds. Then one interpretation [BF2] of Witten’s global anomaly formula and the relationship of anomalies to index theory is in terms of pfaﬃan and determinant line bundles of Dirac operators, as we recount in §11.1. Our treatment is for a general free spinor ﬁeld; with a small modiﬁcation it also applies to Rarita-Schwinger ﬁelds [FH2, Appendix]. In the 1990s and 2000s a more sophisticated general viewpoint on anomalies emerged: the anomaly of an n-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory F is an invertible (possibly truncated 91) pn`1q-dimensional ﬁeld theory α. This idea, which we take up in §11.2, crystallized from many inputs; see [F10, W8] for expositions and examples. In §11.3 we return to free spinor ﬁelds in n dimensions and formulate a precise conjecture for the associated anomaly theory. This particular anomaly theory extends to n ` 1 dimensions, and—conjecturally—it matches the low energy theory of a massive free spinor ﬁeld in n ` 1 dimensions. Therefore, as we explain in Example 11.36, we can use a massless free spinor ﬁeld as a boundary theory for the low energy approximation to the corresponding massive free spinor ﬁeld, leading to a non-anomalous pn ` 1q-dimensional theory on manifolds with boundary. Many special cases of this general situation appear in the physics literature. Finally, in §11.4 we discuss the following assertion: every quantum ﬁeld theory F has an associated anomaly theory αF ,and extra structure—a trivialization of αF —is part of the data of a well-deﬁned quantum ﬁeld theory. That is very useful in general, and in particular illuminates the discussion in §9.1 about the form of the long range ﬁeld theory approximation to a gapped quantum system; see Remark 11.33. 91The anomaly theory α need only be deﬁned on a bordism category of manifolds of dimen- sion ď n;the value αpXq on a closed n-manifold X is a super line. Often α extends to a theory (we still call ‘α’) on a bordism category of manifolds of dimension ď n ` 1, in which case the partition function αpW q of a closed pn ` 1q-manifold W is a nonzero complex number. An anomalous ﬁeld theory is an example of what is sometimes called a twisted ﬁeld theory [ST, §5] or a relative ﬁeld theory [FT1]. 153 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 154 11. ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY This lecture is long on story and short on details! We encourage the reader to consult the vast literature on anomalies to explore further. 11.1. Pfaﬃans of Dirac operators To begin, recall the pfaﬃan in ﬁnite dimensions. Let W be a ﬁnite dimensional complex vector space and (11.1) B : W ˆ W ÝÑ C a skew-symmetric bilinear form. Identify B as a skew-symmetric map W Ñ W ˚, and so an element ωB P Ź2W ˚. A natural “integral” on the exterior algebra is the linear map 92 (11.2) ż ΠW : Ź‚W ˚ ÝÑ Det W ˚, which projects a form of mixed degree to its highest degree component in Det W ˚ “ŹmaxW ˚.If dim W “ 2m is even, then (11.3) ż ΠW e ωB “ ωm B m! “ pfaﬀ B P Det W ˚ is by deﬁnition the pfaﬃan of B;ifdim W is odd, then the integral vanishes. The pfaﬃan is an element of a line, not a number. It is natural to regard Det W ˚ as Z{2Z-graded by the parity of dim W , which is equal to the parity of the dimension of the null space ker B. There is an inﬁnite dimensional version of the pfaﬃan for W a Banach space and B a Fredholm form: B is Fredholm if ker B is a ﬁnite dimensional subspace. As opposed to the ﬁnite dimensional situation (11.3), the Z{2Z-graded line Pfaﬀ B depends on B.As B varies we obtain a nontrivial complex line bundle over the space93 of Fredholm skew forms, and the pfaﬃan elements (11.4) pfaﬀ B P Pfaﬀ B form a section of the pfaﬃan line bundle. The section vanishes identically on the component of Fredholm forms with nonzero mod 2 index; the Pfaﬃan line bundle is odd on that component. The explicit constructions are based on elementary func- tional analysis; see [Q], [Se1, Appendix B] for the following case of the Fredholm determinant. Remark 11.5. A Fredholm map T : U Ñ V between complex Banach spaces has a determinant line, which can be realized as the Pfaﬃan line of a skew-adjoint Fredholm form as follows. Set W “ V ˚ ‘ U with the sum norm and deﬁne (11.6) B`pv˚ 1 ,u1q, pv˚ 2 ,u2q˘ “xv˚ 1 ,T u2y´xv˚ 2 ,T u1y. Then thepfaﬃanlineof B is canonically isomorphic94 to the determinant line of T , and under that isomorphism pfaﬀ B “ det T . 92The odd vector space ΠW , the parity-reversal of W , has as its ring of functions the Z{2Z- graded exterior algebra Ź‚W ˚. This version of fermionic integration is purely algebraic—there is no measure—and it is deﬁned on functions rather than on forms or densities. 93That space has two components distinguished by the parity of dim ker B, the mod 2 index. Over each component the pfaﬃan line bundle represents a generator of H2p´; Zq. 94The determinant line is Z-graded; the quotient Z{2Z-grading matches that of the pfaﬃan line.

ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY 155 A Dirac operator on a closed Riemannian spin manifold is elliptic and deter- mines a Fredholm form (see (11.7) below). There are additional geometric struc- tures constructed using more precise linear analysis. The pfaﬃan line of a Dirac operator carries a natural Hermitian metric due to Quillen [Q]. For a smooth family of Dirac operators the pfaﬃan line bundle over the parameter space has a natural compatible covariant derivative [BF1]; see [F8] for a survey of the geometric and analytic ideas and some mathematical applications.95 We remark that Quillen’s work on determinants was also motivated by applications to arithmetic geometry. Returning to relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, recall from §10.2 that a spinor ﬁeld on Minkowski spacetime is instantiated by a real spinor representation S of Spin1,n´1 together with a symmetric nonnegative Spin1,n´1-invariant bilinear form Γ: S ˆ S Ñ R1,n´1. The complexiﬁcation SC is a representation of the compact spin group Spinn. On a closed Riemannian spin n-manifold X there is an associated complex vector bundle SX Ñ X whose sections are spinor ﬁelds ψ. Deﬁne the complex skew-symmetric form (11.7) BX pψ1,ψ2q“ ż X ΓCpψ1, ∇ψ2q|dx|, where ∇ is induced from the Levi-Civita covariant derivative; ΓC is the complexiﬁ- cation of Γ, promoted to act on spinor ﬁelds; and |dx| is the Riemannian measure. On appropriate function spaces BX is Fredholm. Formally, the partition function of the free spinor ﬁeld on X is the Feynman path integral of the exponential of (11.7) over ψ, which is an inﬁnite dimensional analog of (11.3). Therefore, we deﬁne the result of the not-deﬁned path integral to be (11.4), the (Fredholm) pfaﬃan element pfaﬀ BX of the (Fredholm) pfaﬃan line Pfaﬀ BX . This is the partition function of a (Wick-rotated) ﬁeld theory FpS,Γq. That the partition function is an element of a nontrivial complex line, as opposed to a complex number, signals that FpS,Γq is anomalous. Furthermore, in parametrized families the pfaﬃan line bundle is equipped with a metric and compatible connection. The pfaﬃan line, together with its geometry in parametrized families, is called the anomaly on the mani- fold X. To obtain a well-deﬁned ﬁeld theory of a free spinor ﬁeld we must trivialize the anomaly, coherently96 for varying X. Often the total anomaly of a ﬁeld theory is the tensor product of many contributions, and it is this total anomaly which must be trivialized, not each constituent. For the free spinor ﬁeld a mass term (10.20) trivializes the pfaﬃan line Pfaﬀ BX , as we now explain. First, observe that in the ﬁnite dimensional situation (11.1) the analog of a mass term is a nondegenerate skew-symmetric form (11.8) M : W ˆ W ÝÑ C, which only exists if dim W is even. Let ωM P Ź2W ˚ be the associated 2-form. Then if dim W “ 2m, the nonzero element (11.9) ωm M m! P Det W ˚ 95Missing from those papers is the formula for the moment map of a family of Dirac operators invariant under a Lie group of symmetries; the required formula is proved in [F11]. The moment map most directly reproduces “covariant anomaly” formulas in the physics literature. 96This coherence is the subject of §11.2. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 156 11. ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY trivializes the ﬁnite dimensional pfaﬃan line. The ratio of (11.3) and (11.9) is a complex number, the numerical pfaﬃan. For the Wick-rotated free spinor ﬁeld on a Riemannian manifold X there are Dirac operators mapping between sections of SX Ñ X and S˚ X Ñ X.The compo- sition D2 X of these operators is the elliptic Dirac Laplacian, which we use to decom- pose the inﬁnite dimensional space of spinor ﬁelds as the direct sum Wa‘W K a ,where Wa is ﬁnite dimensional and a is a real parameter; see [F8, §3]. The Dirac Lapla- cian is invertible on W K a . The Weitzenb¨ock formula expresses the Dirac Laplacian as the sum of the covariant Laplacian and scalar curvature, which implies that the appropriate mass operator, constructed from (10.20) and the Riemannian metric, commutes with D2 X . Hence it acts separately on Wa and W K a . Deﬁne the numerical pfaﬃan to be the product of the ﬁnite dimensional numerical pfaﬃan on Wa and a ζ-function regularized numerical pfaﬃan on W K a . Exercise 11.10. Carry out the details of this construction. In particular, verify that the result is independent of a. Recast the construction as a trivialization of thepfaﬃanlinePfaﬀ BX . 11.2. Anomalies as invertible ﬁeld theories We continue the discussion of a free spinor ﬁeld theory FpS,Γq (no mass term) associated to the data pS, Γq. So far we have seen that the formal path integral over a closed Riemannian spin n-manifold X is an element of the anomaly line αpS,ΓqpXq“ Pfaﬀ BX .Since FpS,Γq is a quantum ﬁeld theory, it obeys the locality constraints inherent in describing it as a symmetric monoidal functor (3.2) on a bordism category. It is natural, then, to expect the line αpS,ΓqpXq to also “de- pend locally on X”. In §5.3 we explained that locality of a vector space-valued function leads to the notion of an extended ﬁeld theory, in particular to invariants of lower dimensional manifolds. Thus consider a closed Riemannian spin pn ´ 1q- manifold Y . If the free spinor ﬁeld theory were an ordinary (absolute) ﬁeld theory, then FpS,ΓqpY q would be a topological vector space. However, as was discovered in the 1980s [Se5, Fa2, NAg], this is not the case. Rather, only a projective space is well-deﬁned.97 That we obtain a projective space, as opposed to a vector space, sig- nals an anomaly, here called the Hamiltonian anomaly. We defer to the references [Se5, Fa2, NAg] for the construction of the projective space from a Dirac operator; see also [Lo, Bu] for thorough mathematical treatments. Instead, we describe the formal structure we obtain from the projective space, and use it to motivate viewing anomalies in general as extended ﬁeld theories. Set F “ FpS,Γq and α “ αpS,Γq.If X is a closed n-manifold, then αpXq is a Z{2Z- graded complex line and the anomalous theory F produces a (possibly vanishing) element of αpXq, i.e., a linear map98 (11.11) F pXq : C ÝÑ αpXq. 97The pure states in a quantum system do form a complex projective space (Example 2.11), so for a single quantum system a projective space with no vector space lift is not a problem. A family of quantum systems on Y produces a bundle of projective spaces not expressed—or perhaps not even expressible—as the projectivization of a vector bundle. This is not adequate if we want to “integrate” over the base of the family, which we do if it is a ﬂuctuating ﬁeld in the theory. 98Observe that if αpXq is odd, then F pXq is necessarily the zero map. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 11. ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY 157 An alternative description is in terms of the Cˆ-torsor αpXqˆ of nonzero elements of αpXq. Then, F pXq is a function f : αpXqˆ Ñ C which satisﬁes (11.12) f pℓ ¨ λq“ λ´1f pℓq,λ P Cˆ,ℓ P αpXqˆ. This is often the form of explicit descriptions in the physics literature; extra choices induce a trivialization of αpXq and the partition function is presented as depending on those choices. To set the stage for codimension one, we remark that a complex line is an invertible C-module. Similarly, we posit that for a closed pn ´ 1q-manifold Y the anomaly theory produces an invertible tVectC-module99 αpY q and the anomalous theory produces a tVectC-module map (11.13) F pY q : tVectC ÝÑ αpY q. A complex projective space P gives rise to both a invertible tVectC-module αpY q and a tVectC-module map (11.13) as follows. Deﬁne a Cˆ-gerbe (11.14) GP “ ␣pV, θq : V P tVectC,θ : P – ÝÝÑ PpV q(. The action of a complex line L on pV, θq produces 100 pL´1 b V, θ1q,where θ1 is the composition of θ and the canonical identiﬁcation PpV q– PpL´1 b V q.Let αpY q be the category of functors f : GP Ñ tVectC such that (11.15) f `pV, θq¨ L˘ “ L´1 b f pV, θq,L P LineC, pV, θqP GP. There is a canonical such functor f “ F pY q deﬁned by f pV, θq“ V . Exercise 11.16. Let X be an n-dimensional compact Riemannian spin mani- fold with boundary. Construct a trivialization αpXq of αpBXq. The basic structure of αpS,ΓqpXq,αpS,ΓqpY q is common to the anomaly theory αF of any quantum ﬁeld theory F , not just to the anomaly αpS,Γq ofthefreefermion theory FpS,Γq. Itsuggeststhat αF pXq,αF pY q ﬁt together as part of an invertible ﬁeld theory αF , an assertion which captures the locality properties of the anomaly. (Witten’s paper [W11] was an important clue leading to this conclusion.) The bedrock principles of locality and unitary apply to the anomaly theory αF ,which is then fully extended and reﬂection positive. Initially αF is only deﬁned on manifolds of dimension ď n. We can ask for an extension to a full pn ` 1q-dimensional ﬁeld theory. Such an extension often exists101—it does for free spinor ﬁelds, as we explain in §11.3—but it is not necessary for the description of an anomalous theory F , which only involves manifolds of dimension ď n. To tell the formal structure of an anomalous theory, suppose C is an pn ` 1q-category whose 1-category truncation “at the top” (written Ωn´1C)is 102 tVectC. The anomaly theory of F (without extension to dimension n ` 1) is a homomorphism (11.17) αF :BordnpX∇ n qÝÑ C 99There are gradings, which are important (see (5.37)), but we omit them here. 100The choice of L´1 rather than L is inspired by considering the equivalent category to (11.14) whose objects are tautological line bundles L Ñ P. The action of L sends L Ñ P to L b L Ñ P. The equivalence maps L Ñ P to the space of holomorphic sections of L´1 Ñ P. 101The conformal anomaly of a 2-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory is an example with no extension, essentially because conformal geometry in two dimensions is radically diﬀerent from conformal geometry in higher dimensions. 102Better: the category of super topological vector spaces.

ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY which factors through the maximal subgroupoid C ˆ.Here X ∇ n is the diﬀerential tangential structure which encodes the background ﬁelds of F .The theory F is a natural transformation (11.18) BordnpX∇ n q αF \u0014\u0014 1 \u0015\u0015\u0006 \u0006\u0006 \u0006\u0016\u0016 F C from the tensor unit theory 1 to αF . This notion is discussed in more detail and more generality in [ST, FT2]. Remark 11.19. The theory F is topological if it factors through the topological bordism category BordnpXnq. In some cases the anomaly αF is topological even if F is not. This occurs for free spinor ﬁelds in dimension one, for example; see Example 11.20 below. Or, more generally, αF as a stand-alone theory may factor through a diﬀerent diﬀerential bordism category BordnpY∇ n q or topological bordism category BordnpYnq for some tangential structure Yn and map Xn Ñ Yn. However, αF as the anomaly theory of F is best regarded as having the same domain as F . 11.3. The anomaly theory of a free spinor ﬁeld We begin with the simplest case: quantum mechanics. Example 11.20. As in Example 10.11 the datum is a ﬁnite dimensional real inner product space W . There is no mass term, lest the anomaly be trivialized. Let FW be the resulting 1-dimensional massless spinor ﬁeld, which is deﬁned on spin Riemannian 0- and 1-manifolds. First, consider a positively oriented point. As explained in Example 10.11 the classical theory produces the real operator algebra CliﬀpW ˚q, the Cliﬀord algebra of the dual inner product space. Then FW ppt`q is a complex CliﬀpW ˚q-module H “ H0 ‘ H1, and basic principles of quantization demand that it be irreducible. We might like that (11.21) CliﬀpW ˚q– EndpHq, but this only happens if dim W is even. So for odd dim W we might consider the anomaly αW ppt`q to be nontrivial of order two—the class of CliﬀpW ˚q in the Brauer group, which is the obstruction to (11.21). Note that pt` has a unique spin structure up to isomorphism, and each spin structure has a nontrivial automorphism of order two: the spin ﬂip. It acts on spinor ﬁelds as ´1, hence on CliﬀpW ˚q as the grading operator, an algebra automorphism. Let S be a real spinor representation of Spin1,n´1—that is, an ungraded Cliﬀ 0 n´1,1-module—and Γ : S ˆ S Ñ R1,n´1 a nonnegative symmetric Spin1,n´1- invariant bilinear pairing. We formulate a precise conjecture for the anomaly the- ory αpS,Γq of the n-dimensional free quantum ﬁeld theory FpS,Γq. As in (10.23), drop the contractible choice Γ from the notation. Then by [ABS] the super Cliﬀord module S ‘ S ˚ (see §10.2) determines a KO-class (11.22) rSsP π2´nKO –rS0, Σn´2KOs Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 11. ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY 159 which measures the obstruction to a mass term (see Lemma 10.21). As in (10.9) let φ : M Spin Ñ KO be the Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro map, μ multiplication on KO-theory, and Pfaﬀ : KO Ñ Σ4IZp1q the map deﬁned by a generator of π´4KO. Conjecture 11.23 ([FH1, §9.2.5]). The pn ` 1q-dimensional anomaly theory associated to the n-dimensional free spinor ﬁeld theory FpS,Γq is (11.24) αpS,Γq : MT Spin φ^rSs ÝÝÝÝÝÑ KO ^ Σn´2KO μ ÝÝÑ Σn´2KO Pfaﬀ ÝÝÝÝÝÑ Σn`2IZp1q.

Observe that, by Lemma 10.21, a mass term extends the Cliﬀ n´1,1-module structure on S ‘ S ˚ to a Cliﬀ n´1,2-module structure, and so by [ABS] trivializes the class rSs. In turn, by (11.24) this trivializes the anomaly theory αpS,Γq. This is the extended ﬁeld theory version of the trivialization of the “top piece”—the pfaﬃan line—that we described at the end of §11.1. In these lectures we have suggested two invertible ﬁeld theory interpretations of a map such as (11.24). The ﬁrst, in Ansatz 6.99, is a topological theory of spin manifolds of dimension ď n ` 2. Its value on a closed spin pn ` 2q-manifold M is an integer (up to 2πi). For the theory (11.24) this integer vanishes if n`2isnot amul- tiple of4. If4 ˇ ˇ n ` 2 then there are two irreducible real spin representations S1, S2 and S – S ‘n1 1 ‘ S ‘n2 2 ; see (10.19). The value of α is, up to 2πi, (11.26) αpM q“ cpn1 ´ n2q @ ˆApM q, rM s D , where c “ 1{2if n ” 2 pmod 8q and c “ 1if n ” 6 pmod 8q. (The sign depends on the ordering of S1, S2.) In this scenario α is a primary topological invariant.The second interpretation, described in §9.4, promotes α to a diﬀerential theory ˇα of Riemannian spin manifolds of dimension ď n ` 1. Its value on a closed pn ` 1q- manifold is the exponentiated η-invariant related to (11.26). In this scenario ˇα is a secondary geometric invariant. The relationship between primary and secondary invariants is old. Extended topological ﬁeld theory enhances both to fully local invariants, and the relationship between them persists. The description we gave of the partition function as a secondary geometric invariant made a jump we now make explicit. Namely, from (11.24) what ˇα com- putes on a closed Riemannian spin pn ` 1q-manifold W is the image of a class103 in }KOn´2pW q under the sequence of maps (11.27) }KOn´2pW q π˚ ÝÝÝÑ }KO´3pptq Pfaﬀ ÝÝÝÝÝÑ ­IZp1q 1pptq– R{Zp1q, where π : W Ñ pt. A diﬀerential index theorem [Klo, O, FL] identiﬁes ˇαpW q as the η-invariant of the Dirac operator, which is the description we gave in the previous paragraph. An anomalous n-dimensional theory F with anomaly α is only evaluated on manifolds of dimension ď n. Hence suppose π : X Ñ S is a family of closed Riemannian n-manifolds. Then in the secondary geometric scenario, ˇαpXq is the 103It has a geometric representative constructed from S and the Levi-Civita connection.

The codomain ­IZp1q 2pSq is the abelian group of isomorphism classes of Z{2Z-graded complex line bundles with metric and compatible connection over S. A diﬀerential index theorem 105 identiﬁes ˇαpXq with the isomorphism class of the pfaﬃan line bundle of the Dirac forms (11.7), including the metric and connection described after Remark 11.5. The agreement of (11.24) with the anomaly line bundle is a major motivation for Conjecture 11.23. 11.4. Anomalies everywhere We completely depart the world of mathematical solidity in this section. Thesis 11.29. 106 (1) Every n-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory F has an associated anomaly theory107 αF ;and (2) To deﬁne an absolute ﬁeld theory we must provide a trivialization τ of αF . An “absolute” ﬁeld theory is one which satisﬁes Axiom System 3.1; it is not anoma- lous. Thesis 11.29 is hardly radical, especially if one allows the possibility that αF has a canonical trivialization which can be set equal to τ ; then neither αF nor τ need be mentioned. However, the thesis here is that with rare exceptions (includ- ing Example 1.23, Example 11.36 below) there is no canonical trivialization and, furthermore, some of the choices which appear in quantum ﬁeld theory are encoded in the choice of τ .Whereas τ is involves a choice, the anomaly αF is canonically determined by F , which in the absence of a trivialization is only a relative the- ory (11.18). Finally, αF provides powerful information about a theory, especially if one considers maximal sets of parameters. (This includes relaxing coupling con- stants to background scalar ﬁelds, an often proﬁtable move.) Such information can often be used to make deductions about the long range behavior of F . We will illustrate Thesis 11.29 with several examples, but we ﬁrst enhance diagram (11.18) 104As in footnote 103 there is a diﬀerential cocycle (in some model), not just its diﬀerential cohomology class. 105[FL, Proposition 8.3] is the version for determinants in place of pfaﬃans. 106I believe the point of view articulated in Thesis 11.29 is widely shared. For me, [FM2]was an important input, as were conversations with Nathan Seiberg about [STY] and related topics. See [CFLS] for more along these lines. 107In general αF is a diﬀerential theory; in this section we do not use the embellished ˇαF as we did in §11.3.

ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY 161 to incorporate τ : (11.30) BordnpX∇ n q αF \u0004\u0004 1 \u0013\u0013 \u0006 \u0006\u0006 \u0006\u0016\u0016 τ \u0017\u0017 1 \u0006 \u0006\u0006 \u0006\u0016\u0016 F C The composition τ ˝ F is an absolute n-dimensional ﬁeld theory. A change of the trivialization τ of the anomaly αF is an invertible n-dimensional ﬁeld theory δ, which in the notation of (11.30) is a symmetric monoidal functor (11.31) δ :BordnpX∇ n qÝÑpΩCqˆ. The codomain Picard n-groupoid pΩCqˆ has 1-categorical truncation sLineC at the top. Tensoring by δ maps pF, τ q to pF, τ b δq. Remark 11.32. Invertible theories (11.31) form a categorical abelian group which acts on the (mythical) space of ﬁeld theories pF, τ q by tensoring. Theories in the same orbit may be regarded as closely related. If one works in the frame- work of lagrangians and path integral quantization, then tensoring by an invertible theory amounts to adding (counter)terms to the lagrangian which only depend on the background ﬁelds. For example, if X ∇ n “ SO∇ n —the background ﬁelds are an orientation and Riemannian metric—then such terms vanish on ﬂat manifolds such as En and Mn. Remark 11.33. Thesis 11.29 clariﬁes the appearance of topological ˚ in §9.1. Suppose a theory pF, τ q is gapped. Then the long range approximation to pF, τ b δq is the long range approximation to pF, τ q tensored with δ, and even if pF, τ q is purely topological its product with δ need not be. Example 11.34 (Quantum mechanics). A 1-dimensional invertible ﬁeld theory (11.35) δ :Bord1pSO∇ 1 qÝÑ LineC with domain the bordism category of 0- and 1-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifolds assigns a complex line L to pt` (better: to a germ of an oriented Riemannian 1-manifold) and, for some constant E0 P R, assigns multiplication by e ´τE0 to a closed interval of length τ . So tensoring a 1-dimensional theory pF, τ q with δ amounts to tensoring the state space H by L, which preserves the underlying projective space PpHq– PpHbLq, and shifting the Hamiltonian by the constant E0. As already mentioned, there are ﬁeld theories F whose anomaly αF has a canonical trivialization τ . The canonical trivialization in the following example is implicitly used in Conjecture 10.25. Example 11.36 (Free massive spinor ﬁeld). Let S be a real spinor repre- sentation of Spin1,n´1 and m : S ˆ S Ñ R a mass term. As explained in Re- mark 11.25 the mass term produces a canonical trivialization τpS,mq of the anom- aly αpS,mq of the massive free theory FpS,mq. Wehavenot made τpS,mq very ex- plicit, however, and it would be interesting to do so. One observation is that Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 162 11. ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY the proof of Lemma 10.21, which is carried out explicitly in [FH1, Lemma 9.55], uses the mass term to construct a Cliﬀ n´1,2-module structure on S ‘ S ˚.Write Cliﬀ n´1,2 – Cliﬀ n´2,1 b Cliﬀ 1,1 andﬁxanisomorphism Cliﬀ 1,1 – EndpM q,where M – R1|1.Then (11.37) S 1 ‘ rS 1 :“ HomCliﬀ1,1pM, S ‘ S ˚q is a Cliﬀ n´2,1-module, so S 1 is a real spinor representation of Spin1,n´2.There- fore, S 1 determines an pn ´ 1q-dimensional ﬁeld theory βS1 of massless free spinor ﬁelds. The n-dimensional anomaly theory αS1 is canonically determined, according to Thesis 11.29; its isomorphism class is (11.24). On the other hand, it follows from the Morita maneuver (11.37) that the isomorphism class rS 1sP π3´nKO equals the isomorphism class rS,msP π3´nKO; see (10.23) for the latter. Combine (10.26) and (11.24) to conclude: the long range approximation λpS,mq of FpS,mq is isomorphic to the anomaly theory of αS1 . Choose an isomorphism. Then there is a combined system 108 on manifolds with boundary which has λpS,mq in the bulk and βS1 on the boundary. Many examples are described in [W8]. We need not use the canonical trivialization τ : we can replace pFpS,mq,τpS,mqq by the closely related theory pFpS,mq,τpS,mq b δq for any invertible theory delta :BordnpSpin ∇ n qÑpΩCqˆ. This is usually done if we study the family of free spinor theories parametrized by the mass term. In the simplest 1-dimensional case (Example 10.11) the parameter M P R appears in m “ ` 0 ´M M 0 ˘ and in the Hamiltonian (10.14). It is clear from the latter that, if we ﬁx a Cliﬀ C 2 -module H “ C ‘ C independent of M , then the vacuum switches from even to odd when M ﬂips sign. In other words, we choose a (parametrized) trivialization τ pM q so that for M ­“ 0one of τ pM q,τ p´M q is the canonical trivialization and the other diﬀers by tensoring with the nontrivial invertible 1-dimensional topological spin theory δ which assigns an odd line to the positively oriented spin point. This is a natural choice: the partition function of that parametrized family of theories `F pM q,τ pM q˘ on a spin circle is an analytic function of M . That would not be the case if we use the canonical trivialization for all nonzero M . Remark 11.38. Observe that when Riemannian metrics are present there is a zoo of possible invertible theories (11.39) δ :BordnpSO∇ n qÝÑ ΣnICˆ that can modify a given absolute theory pF, τ q. For example, the partition function on a closed oriented Riemannian n-manifold pX, gq can be (11.40) δpX, gq“ exp ˆ ´ ż X ϕpRgq|dμg| ˙ , where ϕ : R Ñ R is a smooth function, Rg is the scalar curvature, and |dμg| is the Riemannian measure. We say δ is infrared trivial if (11.41) lim λÑ8 δpX, λgq“ 1 108The formal structure of the combined system is described—in the context of topological ﬁeld theory—in [L1, Example 4.3.22]. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 11. ANOMALIES IN FIELD THEORY 163 for all pX, gq. Tensoring by an infrared trivial invertible theory does not change the long range physics, so we may decide to work modulo the subgroup of infrared trivial invertible theories. For example, if X4 “ SO∇ 4 then invertible reﬂection positive theories modulo infrared trivial theories are represented by three families of partition functions: (11.42) exp ˆ ´c1 ż X Rg |dμg| ˙ , exp ˆ ic2 SignpXq˙ , exp ˆ c3 EulerpXq˙ , where c1,c2,c3 P R. The ﬁrst is the Wick-rotated Einstein action, the latter two are topological. The constants c1,c2,c3 are (changes of) choices one must make in passing from theories on M4 or E4 to theories on compact Riemannian manifolds (“background gravity”). ‘Infrared trivial’ can be expressed in terms of a local scaling restriction. A closely related scaling condition is crucial in Gilkey’s proof of the index theorem for Dirac operators [AtBoPa]. We have only illustrated Thesis 11.29 in rather simple quantum ﬁeld theories. The thesis has strong consequences for nontrivial theories which are of interest; see [GKSW, GKKS, CHS, STY] for a small sample. It would be fun to tell more, but we regrettably and regretfully stop.

APPENDIX A Review of Categories The book [R] is a modern introduction to category theory and contains many examples. A.1. Categories and groupoids Definition A.1. A (small) category C consists of a collection of objects, for each pair of objects y0,y1 a set of morphisms Cpy0,y1q, for each object y adistin- guished morphism idy P Cpy, yq, and for each triple of objects y0,y1,y2 acomposi- tion law (A.2) ˝ : Cpy1,y2qˆ Cpy0,y1qÝÑ Cpy0,y2q such that ˝ is associative and idy is an identity for ˝. A morphism f P Cpy0,y1q is invertible (an isomorphism)if there exists g P Cpy1,y0q such that g ˝ f “ idy0 and f ˝ g “ idy1 . If every morphism in C is invertible, then we call C a groupoid. To emphasize that a category is an algebraic structure like any other, we indicate how to formulate the deﬁnition in terms of sets 109 and functions. Then a category C consists of a set C0 of objects, a set C1 of functions, and structure maps (A.3) i : C0 ÝÑ C1 s, t : C1 ÝÑ C0 c : C1 ˆC0 C1 ÝÑ C1 which satisfy axioms expressing identity maps and associativity. The map i at- taches to each object y the identity morphism idy, the maps s, t assign to a mor- phism pf : y0 Ñ y1qP C1 the source spf q“ y0 and target tpf q“ y1,and c is the composition law. The ﬁber product C1 ˆC0 C1 is the set of pairs pf2,f1qP C1 ˆ C1 such that tpf1q“ spf2q. A sample axiom: for all pf : y0 Ñ y1qP C1 the identity c`f, ipy0q˘ “ c`ipy1q,f ˘ “ f holds. Example A.4 (Fundamental groupoid). Let S be a topological space. The simplest invariant is the set π0S. It is deﬁned by imposing an equivalence relation on the set underlying the topological space: points y0 and y1 in S are equivalent if there exists a continuous path which connects them, i.e., a continuous map γ : r0, 1sÑ S which satisfy γp0q“ y0, γp1q“ y1. The fundamental groupoid C “ πď1S is deﬁned as follows. The objects C0 “ S are the points of S.The Hom-set Cpy0,y1q is the set of homotopy classes of maps γ : r0, 1sÑ S which satisfy γp0q“ y0, γp1q“ y1. The homotopies are taken “rel 109ignoring set-theoretic complications 165 Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 166 A. REVIEW OF CATEGORIES boundary”, which means that the endpoints are ﬁxed in a homotopy. Explicitly, a homotopy is a map (A.5) Γ : r0, 1sˆr0, 1sÝÑ S such that Γps, 0q“ y0 and Γps, 1q“ y1 for all s Pr0, 1s. The composition of homotopy classes of paths is associative, and every morphism is invertible. Note that the automorphism group Cpy, yq is the fundamental group π1pS, yq.So πď1S encodes both π0S and all of the fundamental groups. Exercise A.6. Given a groupoid C use the morphisms to deﬁne an equivalence relation on the objects and so a set π0C of equivalence classes. Can you do the same for a category which is not a groupoid? Definition A.7. Let C and D be categories. (1) A functor or homomorphism F : C Ñ D is a pair of maps F0 : C0 Ñ D0, F1 : C1 Ñ D1 which commute with the structure maps (A.3). (2) Suppose F, G : C Ñ D are functors. A natural transformation η : F ñ G is a map of sets η : C0 Ñ D1 such that for all morphisms pf : y0 Ñ y1qP C1 the diagram (A.8) Fy0 Ff \u0004\u0004 ηpy0q \u0005\u0005 Fy1 ηpy1q \u0005\u0005 Gy0 Gf \u0004\u0004 Gy1 commutes. We write η : F Ñ G. (3) A natural transformation η : F Ñ G is an isomorphism if ηpyq : Fy Ñ Gy is an isomorphism for all y P C. In (1) the commutation with the structure maps means that F is a homomorphism in the usual sense of algebra: it preserves compositions and takes identities to identities. A natural transformation is often depicted as in the following diagram: (A.9) C G ˘˘ F ˇˇ \u0006 \u0006\u0006 \u0006\u0016\u0016 η D Definition A.10. Let C, D be categories. A functor F : C Ñ D is an equiva- lence if there exist a functor G : D Ñ C, and natural isomorphisms G ˝ F Ñ idC and F ˝ G Ñ idD to identity functors. Proposition A.11. Afunctor F : C Ñ D is an equivalence if and only if it satisﬁes: (1) For each d P D there exist c P C and an isomorphism `f pcqÑ d ˘ P D; and (2) For each c1,c2 P C the map of Hom-sets F : Cpc1,c2qÑ D`F pc1q,F pc2q˘ is a bijection. If F satisﬁes (i) it is said to be essentially surjective and if it satisﬁes (ii) it is fully faithful. Example A.12 (Functor categories). Show that for ﬁxed categories C, D there is a category HompC, Dq whose objects are functors and whose morphisms are natural transformations. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. A. REVIEW OF CATEGORIES 167 Remark A.13. Categories have one more layer of structure than sets. Intu- itively, elements of a set have no “internal” structure, whereas objects in a category do, as reﬂected by their self-maps. Numbers have no internal structure, whereas sets do. Try that intuition out on each of the examples above. Anything to do with categories has an extra layer of structure. For example, homomorphisms of categories form a category rather than a set (Example A.12). In Deﬁnition A.18 below we see that a monoidal structure has an extra layer of data over a monoid. Definition A.14. Let C be a category and C 1 0 Ă C0 a subset of objects. Then the full subcategory C 1 with set of objects C 1 0 hasasHom-sets (A.15) C 1 1py0,y1q“ C1py0,y1q,y0,y1 P C 1 0. There is a natural inclusion C 1 0 Ñ C0 which is an isomorphism on Hom-sets. We can describe the entire set of morphisms C 1 1 as a pullback: (A.16) C 1 1 \u0004\u0004\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007 \u0005\u0005\u0006\u0006\u0006 C1 sˆt \u0005\u0005 C 1 0 ˆ C 1 0 jˆj \u0004\u0004 C0 ˆ C0 where s, t are the source and target maps (A.3) and j : C 1 0 ãÑ C0 is the inclusion. Recall that if M is a monoid, then the group of units M „ Ă M is the subset of invertible elements. For example, if M is the monoid of n ˆ n matrices under multiplication, then M „ is the subset of invertible matrices, which forms a group. Definition A.17. Let C be a category. Its groupoid of units 110 is the groupoid C „ with same objects C „ 0 “ C0 as in the category C and with morphisms C „ 1 Ă C1 the subset of invertible morphisms in C. Notice that identity arrows are invertible and compositions of invertible morphisms are invertible, so C „ is a category. Obviously, it is a groupoid. A.2. Symmetric monoidal categories and duality A category is an enhanced version of a set; a symmetric monoidal category is an enhanced version of a commutative monoid. The Cartesian product C “ C 1 ˆ C 2 of categories C 1,C 2 has set of objects the Cartesian product C0 “ C 1 0 ˆ C 2 0 and set of morphisms the Cartesian product C1 “ C 1 1 ˆ C 2 1 . We leave the reader to work out the structure maps (A.3). Definition A.18. Let C be a category. A symmetric monoidal structure on C consists of an object (A.19) 1C P C, a functor (A.20) b : C ˆ C ÝÑ C 110usually called the maximal groupoid Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 168 A.

The functor τ in (A.22) is transposition: (A.24) τ : C ˆ C ÝÑ C ˆ C py1,y2q ÞÝÑ py2,y1q A crucial axiom is that (A.25) σ2 “ id . Thus for any y1,y2 P C, the composition (A.26) y1 b y2 σ ÝÝÑ y2 b y1 σ ÝÝÑ y1 b y2 is idy1by2. The other axioms express compatibility conditions among the extra data (A.19)–(A.23). For example, we require that for all y1,y2 P C the diagram (A.27) p1C b y1qb y2 ι \u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014\u0014 α ˛˛\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015\u0015 1C bpy1 b y2q ι \u0004\u0004 y1 b y2 commutes. We can state the axioms informally as asserting the equality of any two compositions of maps built by tensoring α, σ, ι with identity maps. These compositions have domain a tensor product of objects y1,... ,yn and any number of identity objects 1C —ordered and parenthesized arbitrarily—to a tensor product of the same objects, again ordered and parenthesized arbitrarily. Coherence theorems show that there is a small set of conditions which needs to be veriﬁed; then arbitrary diagrams of the sort envisioned commute. You can ﬁnd precise statements and proof in [Mac, JS]. Next, we review duality in a symmetric monoidal category. Let C be a sym- metric monoidal category and x P C. Denote the tensor unit by 1 P C.

Let x be an object in a symmetric monoidal category C. Duality data for x is a triple px_,c,eq consisting of an object x_ P C together with morphisms c :1 Ñ x b x_ and e : x_ b x Ñ 1 such that the compositions (A.29) x cbid ÝÝÝÝÑ x b x_ b x idbe ÝÝÝÝÝÑ x x_ id bc ÝÝÝÝÝÑ x_ b x b x_ ebid ÝÝÝÝÑ x_ are identity maps. We leave the reader to deﬁne a morphism between two duality data triples. The morphism c is called coevaluation and e is called evaluation.We say that x_ is “the” dual to x since any two triples of duality data are uniquely isomorphic. Definition A.30. Let C be a category. (1) If for each pair y0,y1 P C the Hom-set Cpy0,y1q is either empty or contains a uniqueelement, wesay that C is a discrete groupoid. (2) If for each pair y0,y1 P C the Hom-set Cpy0,y1q has a unique element, we say that C is contractible. Proposition A.31. Let C be a symmetric monoidal category and y P C.Then the category of duality data for y is either empty or is contractible. Definition A.32. Let y0,y1 P C be dualizable objects in a symmetric monoidal category and f : y0 Ñ y1 a morphism.

If py_,c,eq is duality data for y,then `F py_q,F pcq,F peq˘ is duality data for F pyq.This proves (1). For (2) we claim that ηpy_q_ is inverse to ηpyq. Note that by Deﬁnition A.32, ηpy_q_ is a map Gpy_q_ Ñ F py_q_, and since Gpy_q“ Gpyq_ it may be in- terpreted as a map GpyqÑ F pyq.Let c :1B Ñ y b y_ and e : y_ b y Ñ 1B be coevaluation and evaluation. Consider the diagram (A.45) Gpyq id bF pcq \u0004\u0004 id bGpcq Gpyqb F py_qb F pyq id bηpy_qbηpyq !!˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘˘ id bηpy_qbid\u0004\u0004 Gpyqb Gpy_qb F pyq id b id bηpyq \u0005\u0005 Gpeqbid \u0004\u0004 F pyq ηpyq \u0005\u0005 Gpyqb Gpy_qb Gpyq Gpeqbid \u0004\u0004 Gpyq We claim it commutes. The left triangle commutes due to the naturality of η applied to the coevaluation c :1B Ñ yby_. The next triangle and the right square commute trivially. Now starting on the left, the composition along the top and then down the right is the composition ηpyq˝ ηpy_q_. The composition diagonally down followed by the horizontal map is the identity, by G applied to the S-diagram relation (A.29) (and using (A.36)). A similar diagram proves that ηpy_q_ ˝ ηpyq“ id. □ A.4. Picard groupoids Definition A.46. A Picard groupoid is a symmetric monoidal category in which all objects and morphisms are invertible. Example A.47. Given a ﬁeld k, there is a Picard groupoid Linek whose ob- jects are k-lines (one-dimensional vector spaces over k) and whose morphisms are isomorphisms of k-lines. Given a space X, there are Picard groupoids LineRpXq and LineCpXq of real and complex line bundles over X. Definition A.48. Let C be a symmetric monoidal category. An underlying Picard groupoid is a pair pC ˆ,iq consisting of a Picard groupoid C ˆ and a functor i : C ˆ Ñ C which satisﬁes the universal property: If D is any Picard groupoid and j : D Ñ C a symmetric monoidal functor, then there exists a unique functor ˜j : D Ñ C ˆ such that the diagram (A.49) C ˆ i \u0004\u0004 C D ˜j \"\"ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ j \u000f\u000f\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t commutes. We obtain C ˆ from C by discarding all non-invertible objects and non-invertible morphisms. The universal property implies that C ˆ is unique up to unique isomor- phism. Associated to a Picard groupoid D are abelian groups π0D, π1D and a k- invariant (A.50) π0D b Z{2Z Ñ π1D. Deﬁne objects y0,y1 P D to be equivalent if there exists a morphism y0 Ñ y1. Then π0D is the set of equivalence classes. The group law on π0D is induced from Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 172 A. REVIEW OF CATEGORIES the monoidal structure b, and it is abelian since b is symmetric. Deﬁne π1D “ Dp1D, 1Dq as the automorphism group of the tensor unit. If y P D then there is an isomorphism (A.51) ´b idy :Autp1DqÝÑ Autpyq, wherewewriteAutpyq“ Dpy, yq.The k-invariant on y is the symmetry σ : y b y Ñ y b y, which is an element of Autpy b yq– Autp1Dq“ π1D. Weleave thereader to verify that the k-invariant determines a homomorphism π0D b Z{2Z Ñ π1D. A.5. Involutions Definition A.52. Let C be a category. (1) An involution of C is a pair pτ, ηq of a functor τ : C Ñ C and a natural isomorphism η :idC Ñ τ 2 such that for any y P C we have τηy “ ητy as morphisms τy Ñ τ 3y. (2) A ﬁxed point of τ is a pair py, θq of an object y P C and an isomorphism y θ ÝÑ τy such that τθ ˝ θ “ ηy as morphisms y Ñ τ 2y. If C is a symmetric monoidal category, then the involution τ is required to be a symmetric monoidal functor: for y1,y2 P C there is given an isomorphism τy1 b τy2 – ÝÝÑ τ py1 b y2q and these isomorphisms are compatible with the symmetry and with η. Example A.53. Let C “ VectC be the category of complex vector spaces and linear maps. Deﬁne τ : C Ñ C to be the functor which takes complex vector spaces and linear maps to their complex conjugates. (The complex conjugate vector space is the same underlying real vector space with the sign of multiplication by ? ´1 P C reversed; the complex conjugate of a linear map is the same map of sets.) Then there is a canonical identiﬁcation of τ 2 with idC . A ﬁxed point is a complex vector space with a real structure. As a variation, if C “ sVectC is the category of super (Z{2Z-graded) vector spaces and τ complex conjugation as above, but now η is composed with the exponentiated grading automorphism (denoted ‘p´1qF ’in the physics literature), then a ﬁxed point is a super vector space with a real structure on its even part and a quaternionic structure on its odd part. If we restrict to the subgroupoid C ˆ of super lines and isomorphisms, then all ﬁxed points are even. Definition A.54. Let pτ, ηq be an involution on a category C.The ﬁxed point category C τ hasasobjects ﬁxedpoints py, θq, and a morphism py, θqÑpy1,θ1q in C τ is a morphism py f ÝÑ y1qP C such that the diagram (A.55) y f \u0004\u0004 θ \u0005\u0005 y1 θ1 \u0005\u0005 τy τf \u0004\u0004 τy1 commutes. There is a forgetful functor C τ Ñ C which maps py, θq ÞÑ y. Example A.56. Let C be the groupoid of Zp1q-torsors:111 an object T is a set with a simply transitive action of the additive group Zp1q and a morphism T Ñ T 1 111Recall that Zp1q“ 2π? ´1Z Ă C. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. A. REVIEW OF CATEGORIES 173 is an isomorphism which commutes with the Zp1q-actions. Let τ be the involution which sends a torsor T to its dual HomZp1qpT, Zp1qq and sends a morphism to its inverse transpose. The dual of T may be identiﬁed with T as a set; the dual Zp1q action by ζ P Zp1q is the original action by ¯ζ. The ﬁxed point category Cτ is equivalent to the set Z{2Z: there are two isomorphism classes of objects and no nontrivial automorphisms. The ﬁrst, which we call ‘Type P’, is the torsor Zp1q with complex conjugation θ as a map to the dual torsor. The second, which we call ‘Type N’, is the torsor π?´1 ` Zp1q with complex conjugation θ.Observe that in theTypePcase theinvolution θ has a ﬁxed point whereas in the Type N case it does not. Also, Zp1q-torsors form a Picard groupoid, as do torsors for any abelian group, and the ﬁxed point category is a Picard groupoid as well. The Type P torsor is the tensor unit; the square of a Type N torsor has Type P. The names derive from the family exp : C Ñ Cˆ of Zp1q-torsors with complex conjugation acting. There are two components Rą0 and Ră0 of ﬁxed points in the base. The ﬁber of exp has Type P over positive real numbers and Type N over negative real numbers; the representatives described above are exp ´1p`1q and exp ´1p´1q, respectively. Definition A.57. Let B, C be categories with involutions and F : B Ñ C a functor. Then equivariance data for F is an isomorphism φ : FτB – ÝÝÑ τCF of functors B Ñ C such that for every object y P B the diagram (A.58) Fy FηB \u0004\u0004 ηC ˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ Fτ 2 By φ2 \u0005\u0005 τ 2 C Fy commutes. There are additional compatibilities for a symmetric monoidal functor between symmetric monoidal categories; we do not spell them out. We often loosely say that “F is an equivariant functor”, but it is important to remember that equivariance is data+condition, not simply a condition. Recall Deﬁnition A.28 of duals in a symmetric monoidal category. Assuming all objects have duals, we can make choices of duality data for all objects at once and so obtain a duality involution δ on C, but δ does not satisfy Deﬁnition A.52 since the direction of morphisms is reversed (A.33); in other words, δ is a functor to the opposite category. Definition A.59. Let C be a category. (1) A twisted involution of C is a pair pδ, ηq of a functor δ : C Ñ C op and a natural isomorphism η :idC Ñ δop ˝ δ such that for any y P C we have δηy ˝ ηδy “ idδy. (2) A ﬁxed point of δ is a pair py, θq of an object y P C and an isomorphism y θ ÝÑ δy such that δθ ˝ ηy “ θ as morphisms y Ñ δy. Deﬁnition A.54 applies with a single change: the direction of the bottom arrow in (A.55) is reversed. Example A.60. For C “ VectC the duality involution δ : C Ñ C op maps a vector space V to its dual V ˚ and a linear map f : V Ñ W to f ˚ : W ˚ Ñ V ˚. Author's preliminary version was made available with permission of the publisher, the American Mathematical Society. 174 A. REVIEW OF CATEGORIES A ﬁxed point of δ is a vector space V equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form; a linear map f : V Ñ W in C δ preserves the bilinear forms. A ﬁxed point for the composite of duality and complex conjugation (Example A.53) is a complex vector space V with a nondegenerate Hermitian form; a linear map f : V Ñ W in the ﬁxed point category is a partial isometry—an injective map which preserves the Hermitian forms. Remark A.61. There is a higher categorical context for Deﬁnition A.59. Let Cat denote the 2-category of categories. There is an involution α :Cat Ñ Cat which sends a category C to its opposite C op. (There is an extra categorical layer over Deﬁnition A.52 since Cat is a 2-category: an involution on Cat is a triple pα, η1,η2q of data and a single condition.) A twisted involution in the sense of Deﬁnition A.59 is ﬁxed point data for α. Definition A.62. Let pτ, ηq be an involution on a symmetric monoidal cate- gory C.A Hermitian structure on an object y P C is an isomorphism h : τy Ñ y_ such that the composition (A.63) τy – τ `py_q_˘ τ ph_q ÝÝÝÝÝÑ τ ` pτyq_˘ – τ 2py_q η´1 ÝÝÝÝÑ y_ is equal to h. Proposition 7.27 asserts that every object in the bordism category of Hn-manifolds has a canonical Hermitian structure. Observe that if F : B Ñ C is an equivariant symmetric monoidal functor between symmetric monoidal categories with involu- tion, as in Deﬁnition 1.43, then the image of a Hermitian structure on an object b P B is a Hermitian structure on Fb.
