Examples Choose the mirror The man, standing in front of a mirror, is h meters high. What is the minimum height of the mirror if he wants to see a full image of himself? Eye level h l1 l2 l2/2 l2/2 l1/2 The minimum height of the mirror should be: l1/2 + l2/2 = (l1+ l2)/2 = h/2 Top of the mirror half way between eye level and top of the head. Corner cube reflector (page 1088, Y&F) Three mutually orthogonal reflecting surfaces. q1q1 90-q1 90-q1 Incoming ray The ray is reflected twice: Once at each mirror. Reflected ray travels in the opposite direction of the incoming ray. Compare this with a plane mirror.
