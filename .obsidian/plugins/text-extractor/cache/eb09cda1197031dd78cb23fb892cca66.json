In an inertial frame Σ two events occur at distance 109 m away from each other and are separated by a time interval of 5 s. Calculate the space-time interval ∆s2 between the events. Using the value of the space-time interval you found answer the following questions: • Is there an inertial frame in which these events happen simultaneously? • Is there an inertial frame where the events happen at the same point in In the case where your answer is yes, ﬁnds the frame’s velocity relative to Σ. [10] 2. Spaceship B appears to have velocity components ux, uy as observed in the reference frame Σ of spaceship A. Spaceship C moves in the positive x direction relative to spaceship A with velocity v. In the reference frame Σ′ of spaceship C, the spaceship B moves vertically (along the y direction). Find v and the velocity u′ of B in the frame Σ. [10] 3. Lying to the public increases the chances of a politician being elected by a factor of 1.5. There are typically four out of ﬁve honest politicians. Find the probability that an elected politician is a liar. [10] 4. Consider the generating function G(z) = A cosh z = ∞∑ n=0 P (n)zn of a discrete probability distribution P (n). (a) Find the value of the constant A and calculate the probabilities for n = 0 and for n = 1. [5] (b) Write down the deﬁnitions for the mean µ and the variance σ2 of the distribution P (n) and calculate them using the generating function above.

Two lovers, R and J, have an argument and ﬂy away from Earth in opposite directions with velocities of equal magnitude V . J is moving in the positive x direction. According to her clock she travels for time TJ /2 before receiving a radio signal from R, in which he apologises and says that he misses J and will not proceed with his journey until he hears from J again. J accepts the apologies and sends a radio signal back to R saying that she is returning immediately (with the same speed V ). Once R receives the message from J he starts the engines and heads back towards Earth with speed V . (a) Draw the Minkowski space-time diagram of the journeys of R and J. Use the frame in which the Earth is at rest and the starting event Es = (ts, xs) = (0, 0). Indicate i. the event E1 when R sends his message and stops, ii. the event EJ when J receives and replies to R’s message, iii. the event E2 when R hears back from J and starts his return journey, iv. the event Ef when R and J meet again. Give an argument why R and J’s reunion happens on Earth. [8] (b) Give the deﬁnition of proper time. Using this deﬁnition calculate the total time of J and R’s journey, i.e.the time elapsed from the moment they separated until the moment they meet again, as measured by a clock in the Earth’s reference frame. [7] (c) Calculate the time t1 in the Earth reference frame when R sent the ﬁrst signal to J. Show that he was waiting for time tw = 2V /c 1 + V /c TJ √1 − V 2/c2 before hearing back from J. [8] (d) R was 20 and J was 3 years older than him when they separated. Given that J was travelling for TJ = 16 years with speed V = 0.6c, deduce the age of R at the (happy) end of his journey.

The photons produce an electron-positron pair, with each particle having the rest me. (a) Calculate the minimum frequency νmin of a photon for which the pair-production process can take place. [5] (b) Assuming that ν > νmin, ﬁnd the energy and momentum of the electron. [5] (c) Find the magnitude v of the electron’s velocity as a function of the frequency ν. [3] (d) Given the frequency ν has a probability density p(ν) = Ae−ν/νmin, ν > 0, calculate the probability p0 that the pair production process takes place, i.e. that ν > νmin. Your answer should contain only Euler’s constant e. [5] (e) Calculate the mean, ⟨ν⟩, and the variance, σ2 ν = ⟨ν2⟩ − ⟨ν⟩2, of the photon’s frequency. [6] (f) Explain why the probability distribution of the electron’s speed is given by P (v) = 1 p0 p(ν(v))dν dv , where p0 is the probability calculated in part (d). Write down an explicit expression for P (v). [6] A35211 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 7. A footballer kicks a ball at an angle θ to the centre-line of the goal, as shown, −π/2 < θ < π/2. The angle θ is randomly distributed with probability density p(θ) = C cos2 θ . (a) Find the value of the constant C. [5] (b) Calculate the standard deviation σ = √⟨θ2⟩ − ⟨θ⟩2. You may use the fact that∫ π 2 − π 2 θ2 cos 2θdθ = −π 2 [6] (c) The ball hits the y axis, situated at a distance L from the footballer, at the point y. Show that the probability density P (y) is given by P (y) = 2 πL 1 [1 + (y/L)2]2 . [8] (d) pG is the probability that the ball hits the goal which is deﬁned by the interval −L < y < L. Using either p(θ) or P (y) show that pG = 1/2 + 1/π ≃ 0.8. [6] (e) The game is over once the ball hits the goal. Calculate the average number of kicks in this game. You may use the fact that ∞∑ k=1 ka k = a (1 − a)2 , |a| < 1 .
