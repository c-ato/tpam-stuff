Find the equations of the tangent and the normal lines to the given curves at the given value of x. Note this means there may be two possible values of y and hence two tangent lines and two normal lines. Use implicit diﬀerentiation to solve this question. (a) 2x2 + 2xy + 2y2 − 5 = 0, x = 0; (b) 34x2 + 24xy − 40x + 41y2 + 30y = 0, x = 0; (c) 8x2 + 12xy + 17y2 − 20, x = 1. (B) Question 14.

Find the equation of the tangents to y = (x − 1) 2 + 8 that intersect the (0,0). (B) Question 18. Find an equation for the hyperbola with centre at (0,0) and: (a) has foci F (±5, 0) and vertices V (±3, 0); (b) has vertices V (±4, 0) and intersects P (8, 2). (B) Question 19. You should be able to make a suitable rotation and translation to the conic in standard form to derive your answer, after sketching the conic. (a) For the parabola with directrix y = 1√3x and focus at F (− 1 2, √3 2 ), sketch the vertex, axis of the parabola, focus and directrix on the xy-plane. Additionally, determine a quadratic equation in x and y that describes the parabola. (b) For the ellipse foci F1(− √2, 0) and F2(0, −√ 2) and eccentricity e = 1 2, sketch the vertices, major axis, minor axis, foci and directrices on the xy-plane. Additionally, determine a quadratic equation in x and y that describes the ellipse. (C) Question 20. Give a deﬁnition for the set of points in the plane that deﬁne a circle (see the deﬁnitions of a parabola, ellipse and hyperbola in the notes). Also, derive the standard equation of a circle 1 a2 (x2 + y2) = 1 with centre (0,0) (proceed as in the proof of Theorem 6.13 ... albeit not for as long).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
