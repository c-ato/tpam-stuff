A current I (ignore resistance) circulates anticlockwise in the loop. Point P is directly above the middle of side (4) at distance r ≫ a from the centre of the loop, as seen in the ﬁgure below. The loop and P are in the (x, y) plane, with the z-axis of the coordinate system pointing out of the page. 1. Explain why the magnitudes of the magnetic ﬁeld, B, at P generated by the current ﬂowing through sides (1) and (3) individually are negligible compared to those from each of the sides (2) and (4). [3] 2. Determine the total contribution from the current ﬂowing through sides (2) and (4) to B(P ) to leading order in (a/r) (magnitude and direction). [3] 3. Determine the total contribution from the current ﬂowing through sides (1) and (3) to B(P ) to leading order in (a/r) (magnitude and direction). [3] 4. Hence, determine the total magnetic ﬁeld B(P ) from the whole loop to leading order in (a/r). [1]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
