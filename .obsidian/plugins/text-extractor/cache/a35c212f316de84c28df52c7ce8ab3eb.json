Distinguished among them are exact dualities, in which every state and operator — at every energy scale — has a known map between two theories. Exact dualities can be proven for entire classes of theories, and they are among the most powerful tools available for studying high-energy, strongly quantum regimes. Perhaps the best example of such an application is the solution of the 2D Ising model at all couplings via exact fermionization. Other important exact dualities are 4D Abelian electric-magnetic duality, 3D particle-vortex duality (in its “weak” version [1]), and 3D Chern-Simons level-rank dualities. Unsurprisingly, such power comes with a price: in order to prove exact dualities, a fully reg- ularized, nonperturbative formulation of a theory must be known. Lattice theories (e.g. [2]) and axiomatically deﬁned topological ﬁeld theories [3] are standard examples of these formulations. At this time, many theories of interest do not appear to naturally lend themselves to such regularization, the most ﬂagrant examples being the Standard Model (and other chiral theories), nonlagrangian 2 quantum ﬁeld theories, and most theories of gravity in more than two dimensions. Nevertheless, studying exact dualities in the situations where they may be proven already provides a wealth of insights into quantum ﬁeld theory. This paper deals with exact dualities in Hamiltonian lattice systems in one and two spatial dimensions.1 It has multiple goals. The ﬁrst, rather down-to-earth goal is to generalize the recently established 3D bosonization duality [5] to spatial surfaces of higher genus and to parafermions. The second goal is to compile a mini-compendium of exact lattice dualities with all the important details spelled out, extending and streamlining the overview [6]. The third goal is to systematize various notions of “twisting” that can be performed on dual pairs of theories in order to derive new dualities.2 The fourth and perhaps most important goal is to clarify what it means for a generic (possibly nonrelativistic and nontopological) fermion theory to depend on a spin structure. This ﬁnal goal deserves some further elaboration. Spin structures routinely appear in relativistic fermionic theories (see e.g. [9, 10]), but they exist in discrete theories, too (see e.g. [11–17]). How to deﬁne spin structures in a general way? One important lesson of this paper is that spin structures can always be viewed as Z2 topological gauge ﬁelds whose gauge group is generated by the fermion number parity operator (−1)F .3 The distinction between spin and non-spin theories, i.e. between theories that do and do not depend on a choice of spin structure, is equivalent to the distinction between spin structures being background or dynamical ﬁelds. In both cases, these gauge ﬁelds can be called topological because their ﬁeld strength is ﬁxed by requiring that they encode all ordering ambiguities of the fermionic Hilbert space: this ﬁeld strength can be canonically chosen to equal the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the manifold in question. This point of view permeates many papers, in particular [14], but appears not to have been articulated in simple terms. This paper aims to ﬁll this gap. 1The focus on low dimensions is more a matter of convenience: this way it is much simpler to illustrate the main ideas. All dualities discussed in this paper will have a straightforward (if notationally horrendous) generalization to higher dimensions, and occasionally these generalizations will be spelled out in this work. The focus on Hamiltonian (operator) methods is chosen for three reasons. One is, again, convenience: instead of working in D spacetime dimensions, one can work in d = D − 1 spatial dimensions where the geometry is simpler. Another reason is the generality: when working with operator algebras, no particular Hamiltonian (or action) needs to be speciﬁed when proving exact dualities. Thus the requirements for a duality to hold become more transparent, as does the counting of degrees of freedom. The ﬁnal reason is related to this last point: operator methods make it clear how to deﬁne entanglement entropy and thus how to study the entanglement structure of states even when the Hilbert space does not factorize, for instance due to the presence of gauge constraints. While entanglement will not be the subject of this paper, the analysis presented here synergizes with that in [4] to make it possible to study, for example, entanglement of spin structures or the detailed mapping of entanglement under exact dualities. 2This is related to promoting a background gauge ﬁeld to a dynamical one. A familiar example is the S generator of the Kapustin-Strassler-Witten SL(2, Z) group action on 3D theories with U(1) symmetry [7, 8], which can be used to elegantly create duality webs in three dimensions. In this paper, an analogous procedure is applied to theories with any Abelian symmetry in any dimension. 3In one spatial dimension, this story can be made more intricate due to various low-dimensional coincidences that will be discussed throughout the main text. 3 The rest of this work is organized in a relatively straightforward way: exact dualities are examined systematically, for d = 1 and d = 2 spatial dimensions, for boson-boson (Kramers- Wannier [18]), boson-fermion (Jordan-Wigner [19]), and boson-parafermion (Fradkin-Kadanoﬀ [20]) maps, and for all natural twists and generalizations that present themselves along the way. The bulk of the text is a derivation of various dualities, most of which are summarized below for covenience. (Checks (∨) indicate that the theory lives on a dual lattice, and “/G” denotes projection to the singlet sector of a global symmetry G, which may be ordinary or higher-form [21]. Other details of various dualities are explained in the corresponding sections of the main text.) The end of each section serves to draw more general lessons about dualities discussed up to that point.

Consider a system of bosonic Z2 degrees of freedom (“Ising spins” or just “spins”) on N sites arranged in a circle (ﬁg. 1). Its algebra of operators is generated by pairs of Pauli matrices Xv and Zv on each site v. In the Z-eigenbasis, the operators on each site can be recorded as Z =   1 0 0 −1   , X =   0 1 1 0   . (1) Unsurprisingly, the archetypical theory of Ising spins is the Ising model in a transverse ﬁeld h, given by the Hamiltonian HIsing = N∑ v=1 (XvXv+1 + hZv) , XN +1 ≡ X1. (2) The transverse ﬁeld Ising model — and essentially any other theory where the operator algebra is generated by {Xv, Zv} — exhibits two well-known classes of exact dualities: Kramers-Wannier (boson-boson, [18]) and Jordan-Wigner (boson-fermion, [19]). Subsections 2.1 and 2.2 are dedicated to reviewing these standard ideas and explaining the word “essentially” in the previous sentence. A systematic procedure called duality twisting will then be described in subsection 2.3, where it will be used to establish a web of d = 1 dualities in a way that can be generalized to higher dimensions. Figure 1: A periodic lattice with N = 9 sites (black) and N edges between them. In this section, each site v of such a lattice hosts a two-dimensional Hilbert space of an Ising spin, and the algebra of operators at that site is generated by the Pauli matrices Xv and Zv. The dual (red) lattice has a site corresponding to each of the edges of the original lattice, and an edge corresponding to each vertex of the dual lattice. The edge-vertex duality is the d = 1 avatar of the more general Poincar´e duality. 5 2.1 Kramers-Wannier Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality maps Ising spins to Ising spins on the dual lattice (also shown on ﬁg. 1). The dual lattice is again a circle of N sites which can be conveniently labeled by half-integers 1 2 , 3 2 , . . . , N − 1 2 , with dual site v + 1 2 corresponding to the edge between sites v and v + 1. The standard version of the KW mapping is Zv = X ∨ v− 1 2 X ∨ v+ 1 2 , XvXv+1 = Z∨ v+ 1 2 . (3) The index v here takes values v = 1, . . . , N , with v + N ≡ v. The algebras generated by {Zv, XvXv+1} and {Z∨ v+ 1 2 , X ∨ v− 1 2 X ∨ v+ 1 2 } are obviously isomorphic. Each algebra has a center gener- ated by the product of all the Z operators; this is a global kinematic Z2 symmetry. (A symmetry is kinematic if its generators form the center of the algebra in question, i.e. if every Hamiltonian belonging to this algebra must have this symmetry.) Naively, this would mean that states that map under this duality are eigenstates of Q ≡ ∏ v Zv (4) (and their statistical mixtures) in the original theory, and eigenstates of Q ∨ ≡ ∏ v Z∨ v+ 1 2 (5) (and their mixtures) in the dual theory; one might also expect that the global Z2 symmetries may just map to each other. This turns out to be wrong after studying the global consequences of the above local relations between generators. The duality (3) actually produces a constraint. By taking a product over all v the following consistency relations emerge: Q ∨ = ∏ v XvXv+1 = 1 and Q = ∏ v X ∨ v− 1 2 X ∨ v+ 1 2 = 1 . (6) These conditions must be understood as promises that the only states that will ever be considered are those in which these operator equations are obeyed: density matrices of all other states do not belong to the algebras generated by {Zv, XvXv+1} or {Z∨ v+ 1 2 , X ∨ v− 1 2 X ∨ v+ 1 2 }. Thus the Z2 symmetry is projected to its singlet sector on both sides of the duality.4 Another way to say this is that 4Projecting to the singlet sector is similar, but not the same as gauging the theory with a given symmetry. The former just means that a global constraint is imposed on the theory, and that only operators commuting with this 6 ordinary KW is a map between two spin systems in which the modes with zero spatial momentum are not dynamical. This is a self-duality.5 Note that the standard KW duality cannot be implemented in every spin chain: the Hamilto- nian must have a well-deﬁned mapping under (3). The Ising model (2) can be dualized, but its deformation HIsing(hx) ≡ HIsing + hx ∑ v Xv (7) does not have a KW dual because it cannot be consistently projected to the singlet sector. An alternative KW transformation can be applied to arbitrary spin systems, however. It can be obtained by adding topological gauge ﬁelds to one side of the original KW duality; appropriate local gauge constraints that mix matter and gauge ﬁelds are assumed, otherwise adding the gauge ﬁeld would be a wholly trivial procedure. This procedure for generating dualities works in any dimension; in d = 1 gauge theories are automatically topological so here there is no need to be restricted to a particular class of Hamiltonians for the gauge sector. Consider adding gauge ﬁelds to the theory on the dual lattice, whose links are labeled by integers (so, for instance, the dual link v connects dual vertices v − 1 2 and v + 1 2 ). The gauge ﬁeld position and momentum operators will be denoted Z∨ v and X ∨ v . The Gauss operators of interest are G∨ v+ 1 2 ≡ X ∨ v Z∨ v+ 1 2 X ∨ v+1. (8) The gauge-invariant algebra consists of operators that commute with all the G∨’s. Its generators are electric ﬁelds X ∨ v , matter position operators Z∨ v+ 1 2 , and “covariant” matter kinematic operators X ∨ v− 1 2 Z∨ v X ∨ v+ 1 2 . The product of the latter gives the Wilson loop W ∨ ≡ ∏ v Z∨ v . (9) Gauging means working only within the subspace in which G∨ v+ 1 2 = 1 . This subspace is 2N - dimensional: it is a direct product of the 2N −1-dimensional space of “matter singlets” from the previous passage and of the two-dimensional space of W ∨-eigenstates. It is now possible to dualize constraints are allowed. On the other hand, a theory is gauged if it is coupled to the appropriate gauge ﬁeld and a local Gauss constraint is imposed. The global singlet constraint follows from multiplying all the local constraints. If a theory is topologically gauged, the gauge ﬁeld is taken to be topological, i.e. the curvature of the gauge ﬁeld is ﬁxed. Topologically gauging is the closest one can get to projecting to the singlet sector while only imposing local constraints. Topologically gauged and singlet-projected theories only diﬀer by holonomies on manifolds that are not simply connected. For examples where this diﬀerence is crucial, see [22, 23]. 5It is wrong to say that Z2 is spontaneously broken on both sides of the duality. In a pair of KW-dual theories every state in the spectrum must be a Z2-singlet, and there is generically no ground state degeneracy. 7 the entire original spin chain, via Zv = X ∨ v− 1 2 Z∨ v X ∨ v+ 1 2 , Xv = X ∨ v . (10) The old mapping XvXv+1 = Z∨ v+ 1 2 from (3) can be derived from this one by dualizing both X ∨’s that appear in the Gauss law G∨ v+ 1 2 = 1 . Note that the Z2 charge of the original system maps to the dual Wilson line, Q = W ∨. Another interpretation of this Wilson line is the phase/monodromy associated to transporting an excitation along the spatial circle. (This intuition is precise in a gapped phase.) In other words, Q dualizes to a boundary condition, which is in this case a fully quantum degree of freedom. The duality (3) simply maps h ↦→ 1/h in the Ising model (2) (as two Hamiltonians can be considered equivalent if they diﬀer by an overall rescaling). The deformed Ising Hamiltonian (7) dualizes to HIsing(hx) = ∑ v (Z∨ v− 1 2 + hX ∨ v− 1 2 Z∨ v X ∨ v+ 1 2 + hxX ∨ v ) . (11) Now the gauge ﬁelds enter the Hamiltonian, and 1/h can be interpreted as the transverse ﬁeld while hx/h can be interpreted as the gauge coupling. 2.2 Jordan-Wigner Jordan-Wigner (JW) duality maps the original Ising spin theory to that of two Majorana operators per site, χv = Z1Z2 · · · Zv−1Xv, χ′ v = Z1Z2 · · · Zv−1Yv. (12) A beginning point must be chosen, but its choice does not aﬀect the physics. The paramagnetic state with Zv = 1 on all sites maps to the state with no fermions, denoted |0⟩. The rest of the Hilbert space maps follow from this convention and eq. (12), by acting on |0⟩ with diﬀerent operators. It is convenient to deﬁne bosonic operators that are fermion bilinears, Svu ≡ −iχ′ vχu, Zv ≡ iχ′ vχv. (13) The Zv built out of fermions is the same as the bosonic one (hence the same label), and it measures the fermion number at site v. Meanwhile, Sv,v+1 moves an excitation between v and v + 1, and its 8 bosonic dual is Sv,v+1 = XvXv+1 for v = 1, . . . , N − 1, SN,1 = Y1Z2 . . . ZN −1YN = −QX1XN . (14) This means that ∏ v Sv,v+1 = −Q, (15) so the transport of a fermion around the circle depends on how many other fermions there are along the way.6 Note that here there is no need to introduce a gauge ﬁeld to get nontrivial global properties of fermion transport, unlike in the KW story. Indeed, JW duality maps the entire 2N -dimensional space of Ising spins to the fermionic system from the get-go. The gauged spin system on the dual lattice in the map (10) can be replaced with Z2 QED7 (with spinless fermions) by applying a JW transformation on the matter variables X ∨ v+ 1 2 and Z∨ v+ 1 2 . This gives the following map between an ordinary spin chain and a theory of spinless fermions on dual sites coupled to Z2 gauge ﬁelds: Zv = S∨ v− 1 2 , v+ 1 2 Z∨ v ≡ −iχ′∨ v− 1 2 Z∨ v χ∨ v+ 1 2 for v = 1, . . . , N − 1, ZN = −S∨ N − 1 2 , 1 2 Z∨ N ≡ iχ′∨ N − 1 2 Z∨ N χ ∨ 1 2 , Xv = X ∨ v , (16) with the gauge constraint G∨ v+ 1 2 = X ∨ v Z∨ v+ 1 2 X ∨ v+1 = 1 (17) as before. These relations imply Q = W ∨ and Q ∨ ≡ ∏ v iχ′∨ v+ 1 2 χ∨ v+ 1 2 = 1 , (18) consistent with the previous dualities. The diﬀerent mapping of ZN in (16) is crucial for overall consistency. In particular, the Ising model (2) maps to a Z2 QED at zero coupling with antiperiodic boundary conditions (BCs) for fermions. 6This is intuitive: if there is an even number of fermions in a state (Q = 1 ), transporting one fermion means commuting it past an odd number of fermions. Hence the minus sign. It is important to stress that the fermionic excitations are transported by Svu, not by ψ† vψu, so in this picture they are not “hard-core” and can pass through each other while leaving a minus sign in the wavefunction. 7By the conventions of Kogut and Susskind [24], the lattice Hamiltonian for Maxwell theories with Z2 gauge group and coupling g is Hgauge = g2 ∑ v X ∨ v in d = 1. “Zero coupling” means g = 0, implying Hgauge = 0. The matter still has unit charge under the gauge symmetry, which means that it is coupled to the gauge ﬁelds via the Gauss operators G ∨ v+ 1 2 in (17). 9 The word “antiperiodic” is subtle: the algebra does not know about periodicity and there is no ﬁxed monodromy due to a gauge ﬁeld. However, by (16) the term ∑N v=1 Zv in HIsing dualizes to ∑N v=1(−i)χ′∨ v− 1 2 Z∨ v χ∨ v+ 1 2 with the convention χ∨ v+ 1 2 +N = −χ∨ v+ 1 2 .8 Antiperiodicity thus only enters at the level of the Hamiltonian. For instance, for Hamiltonians which do not feature terms like ∑ v Zv, such as e.g. ∑ v Xv, there is no reason to say that the fermions are antiperiodic. When applying the ordinary JW (12) to the Ising model (2), ∑ v XvXv+1 maps to S12 + S23 + . . . + SN −1,N − QSN,1, and the states with Q = 1 are said to have antiperiodic (Neveu-Schwarz) BCs while states with Q = −1 have periodic (Ramond) ones.9 The upshot of this discussion is that the notion of periodicity for fermions is context-dependent and only has meaning relative to a speciﬁc class of Hamiltonians; in the above example, the notion of boundary conditions arose naturally from the fact that HIsing was a sum of N − 1 terms of form Sv,v+1 and one term −QSN,1. More formally, this context-dependence reﬂects the fact that the space of spin structures is an aﬃne space, as will be discussed in some more detail in subsection 3.3. 2.3 Twisted dualities The dualities discussed so far, applied to Ising spins in d = 1, are spins/Z2 = spins ∨/Z2, spins = gauged spins ∨ = fermions with dynamical BCs = Z2 QED ∨ with antiperiodic BCs. (19) Recall that checks (∨) indicate that the theory lives on a dual lattice, and “/Z2” denotes projection to the singlet sector of the global Z2 symmetry. The notion of (anti)periodicity on the fermion side is the one inherited from the Ising model (2) as discussed in the previous subsection. Diﬀerent Hamiltonians may yield diﬀerent boundary conditions. There are more dualities that can be obtained from the ones above. In particular, dualities that map singlet sectors of global symmetries can be modiﬁed so that the singlet sector of one symmetry is mapped to a ﬁxed nonzero charge sector of another symmetry. These modiﬁcations of dualities will be called twists. One way to think about them is as classical background ﬁelds that must be 8The Hamiltonian does not feature χ′∨ v+ 1 2 +N , so there is no need to deﬁne a speciﬁc boundary condition for this operator. A diﬀerent Hamiltonian could have lead to a natural boundary condition for χ′, too, and in that case the entire complex fermion ψ would have been given a natural boundary condition. 9Boundary conditions that depend on a global charge like Q will be called dynamical. In any d, dynamical boundary conditions will depend on one-form charges. In d = 1, one-form charges are the same as familiar zero-form charges. 10 turned on for a particular duality to hold. Consider the following twist of KW duality (3) for η∨ v ∈ {±1}: Zv = η∨ v X ∨ v− 1 2 X ∨ v+ 1 2 XvXv+1 = Z∨ v+ 1 2 . (20) The duality is consistent if Q = N∏ v=1 η∨ v and Q ∨ = 1 . (21) Thus, choosing e.g. η∨ N = −1 and η∨ 1 = . . . = η∨ N −1 = 1 gives a duality between the Q = −1 sector of the original theory and the singlet, Q∨ = 1 , sector of the dual theory. Introducing twisting variables ηv+1/2 in the second line of (20) can further change the duality to be between the −1 sectors of each theory. The singlet sector constraints do not change under “gauge transformations” that ﬂip the sign of two η∨ v ’s or ηv+ 1 2 ’s. The second KW duality (10) now follows from promoting the twists η∨ v to dynamical variables Z∨ v . The operators that change Q on the original lattice can be mapped to operators that change ∏v η∨ v on the dual lattice, namely X ∨ v . In general, all that is needed is to promote ∏v η∨ v into a new Z2 degree of freedom, but it is more natural to do this locally by replacing each η∨ v with Z∨ v and then imposing gauge constraints at dual sites. The JW map (12) is not a “singlet-singlet” duality, so there is no reason to twist it. However, consider the following mapping of bilinears Svu and Zv: Zv = iχ′ vχv, XvXv+1 = −iχ′ vχv+1 ≡ Sv,v+1. (22) This is a new singlet-singlet duality: the second line (which holds for all v = 1, . . . , N and assumes that χN +1 = χ1) implies that (22) maps the Q = −1 sectors to each other. (Recall that the original duality (12) had XvXv+1 = (−Q)δv,N Sv,v+1.) The map (22) can ﬁrst be twisted to give Zv = iχ ′ vχv, XvXv+1 = ηv+ 1 2 Sv,v+1, (23) with the last line again applying to all v = 1, . . . , N . Choosing the c-numbers ηv+ 1 2 such that their product is −1 gives another singlet-singlet duality, this time with Q = 1 on both sides. 11 Now consider again promoting ηv+ 1 2 to a Z2 gauge ﬁeld Zv+ 1 2 , getting a tentative duality of the form Zv = iχ′ vχv, XvXv+1 = −iχ′ vZv+ 1 2 χv+1 = Sv,v+1Zv+ 1 2 . (24) The second line implies a global consistency condition QW = −1 (25) with W ≡ ∏v Zv+ 1 2 . (The dual of ∑ v XvXv+1 in this case is a fermion with periodic BCs.) If the goal is to get a full duality involving all sectors of Q, the theory of fermions and gauge ﬁelds cannot be Z2 QED like in (16), i.e. the gauge constraint cannot be Xv− 1 2 ZvXv+ 1 2 = 1 . Such a constraint would imply Q = 1 and hence W = −1 , completely freezing out all Z2 gauge degrees of freedom and giving back the singlet-singlet duality (23) with ∏v ηv+ 1 2 = −1. Consider, however, the following unusual gauge constraint: Xv− 1 2 ZvXv+ 1 2 = (−W )δv,1. (26) Both Zv and Sv,v+1Zv+ 1 2 are gauge-invariant under this constraint, and taking a product over all v gives QW = −1 as required. It is easy to check that the full duality is Zv = iχ ′ vχv, Xv = X 1 2 (iχ′ 1χ1)Z1+ 1 2 (iχ′ 2χ2) · · · Zv− 1 2 χv, (27) with the operators on the r.h.s. being the generators of the gauge-invariant algebra appropriate to the modiﬁed constraint (26). The ordinary JW transformation follows after fully gauge-ﬁxing because the Wilson line W is constrained to equal −Q. Note the diﬀerence between twisting (3) and (22): in the former case, the Wilson loop was necessary to achieve the full mapping (10), while in the latter case the Wilson loop ended up being constrained and tradeable for a matter degree of freedom in the full mapping (12). This last phenomenon is a d = 1 coincidence: generically the topological degrees of freedom will be there to stay after twisting. 12 2.4 A comment on orientations The above analysis tacitly assumed that all the links were directed the same way, say from v to v + 1. This choice was reﬂected in working with Suv = −iχ′ uχv as opposed to S′ uv = −iχ′ vχu: the algebra of fermion bilinears is generated by one fermion number operator Z per site and by one hopping operator S per link, and it was a matter of convention to always pick Sv,v+1 as the generator associated to link v + 1 2 . Changing this convention, or equivalently changing the orientation of a link, aﬀects the form the duality takes. Indeed, substituting Sv,v+1 ↦→ S′ v,v+1 in (22) does not lead to a duality, and no choice of twisting changes this fact. To recover a duality, the other side of the mapping must be changed as well, getting e.g. YvYv+1 = S′ v,v+1. In general, there is thus no well-deﬁned action of orientation change on the periodicity of fermions (i.e. on the twists ηv+ 1 2 ). A very special exception to this will appear in subsection 3.3, where a particular class of orientations will be identiﬁed with gauge ﬁeld variables in a 2D path integral. 3 Z2 dualities in d = 2 Consider a lattice M with oriented links ℓ (ﬁg. 2). The two vertices belonging to ℓ will be denoted ℓ1 and ℓ2, with the convention that the link is oriented from ℓ1 towards ℓ2. Faces (plaquettes) f ∈ M also admit a canonical enumeration f0, f1, . . . of their constituent vertices if the orientation of links in M forms a branching structure, which will be discussed more below. The dual lattice M∨ has faces labeled by v, links labeled by ℓ, and vertices labeled by f , and as before operators that live on M∨ will be denoted by a check (∨). Abusing the notation a bit, M and M∨ will henceforth also denote the spaces of k-chains Ck(M, Z2) and Ck(M∨, Z2) for each k = 0, 1, 2. In section 4 each appearance of Z2 should be replaced with ZK. Recall a few more terms that will be used later in this paper. A boundary operator ∂ acts on chains in the usual way, lowering their order. For instance, the boundary of a link ℓ is the zero- chain ∂ℓ = ℓ1 + ℓ2. Boundary operators on the dual lattice will be denoted ∂∨. A chain with no boundary is called a cycle. A k-cochain is a function from k-chains (e.g. sites, links, faces) to ±1, with the composition of cochains obtained by multiplication.10 Coboundary operators δ increase the order of cochains and are analogous to exterior derivatives of forms on manifolds. For instance, the coboundary of a “delta function” on site v — a zero-cochain ∆v that is −1 on v and +1 elsewhere — is a product of delta functions on links containing v, δ∆v = ∏ℓ⊃v ∆ℓ. 10Note the further notation abuse for the sake of convenience: chains are composed by addition, with coeﬃcients in {0, 1}, while cochains are multiplied. “Cochains” in this paper are really exponentials of cochains that are composed additively. 13 ℓℓ ℓ1ℓ1 ℓ2ℓ2 v ∈ Mv ∈ M v ∈ M∨v ∈ M∨ f ∈ Mf ∈ M f ∈ M∨f ∈ M∨ Figure 2: A rectangular lattice M (black) and its dual lattice M∨ (red). The ﬁgure depicts examples of an oriented link ℓ and its endpoints ℓ1/2, a site v ∈ M and its dual face, and a face f and its dual site. In this section, Z2 degrees of freedom can be associated either to vertices, edges, or faces of both M and M∨. Subsections 3.1 and 3.2 generalize the KW and JW dualities from the previous section. In particular, subsection 3.2 introduces a number of important ideas, deﬁning ﬂux attachment and demonstrating the anomaly of the one-form symmetry in whose singlet sector a dual of a fermionic theory must be. Subsection 3.3 reviews some background on spin structures and shows how it is reasonable to identify them with twists of JW dualities. 3.1 Kramers-Wannier and its twisting The standard Z2 version of KW duality applies to spins living on sites in M. It is given by Xℓ1Xℓ2 = X ∨ ℓ , Zv = W ∨ v . (28) The operators on the right-hand side are local generators of the gauge-invariant algebra of a pure Z2 gauge theory.11 They are, respectively, the electric ﬁelds on dual links and Wilson loops along dual faces. Consistency again enforces a singlet constraint on both theories. The second line of (28) enforces Q ≡ ∏ v Zv = 1 , (29) 11The full algebra of this gauge theory is generated by a pair of Pauli matrices X ∨ ℓ , Z ∨ ℓ on each link. This algebra is not gauge-invariant, but it is a useful concept to deﬁne [4]. Gauge-invariant operators are those that commute with Gauss operators, G ∨ f ≡ ∏ ℓ⊂f X ∨ ℓ , on all sites v. The algebra of gauge-invariant operators is generated by X ∨ ℓ , W ∨ v ≡ ∏ v⊃ℓ Z ∨ ℓ , and by nonlocal operators W ∨ c ≡ ∏ ℓ⊂c Z ∨ ℓ along noncontractible one-cycles on M. 14 like before. The ﬁrst line enforces a new kind of constraint, T ∨ c ≡ ∏ ℓ⊂c X ∨ ℓ = 1 , (30) where c is a one-cycle on the original lattice M. If c is contractible, this constraint is equivalent to the Gauss law in the interior of c on M∨. In particular, if c is just a plaquette f , the constraint is G∨ f = 1 . On the other hand, if c is noncontractible, this is a genuinely new constraint. The operators T ∨ c in a gauge theory generate one-form symmetries, so the gauge theory can be understood to be projected to the singlet sector of a one-form symmetry. Both singlet constraints can be twisted. The analogue of the d = 1 twist (20) is ηℓXℓ1Xℓ2 = X ∨ ℓ , Zv = W ∨ v . (31) This aﬀects the one-form constraint, which becomes T ∨ c = ∏ ℓ⊂c ηℓ. (32) Note that “gauge transformations” of the ηℓ’s do not change the singlet constraint: for any v and c, the product ∏ℓ⊂c ηℓ stays the same when all twists ηℓ for ℓ ⊃ v are ﬂipped. Indeed, like before, the twists can be replaced with topological gauge ﬁelds, leading to the duality Xℓ1ZℓXℓ2 = X ∨ ℓ , Zv = W ∨ v , Wc = T ∨ c , Tc∨ = W ∨ c∨, (33) where c∨ is a noncontractible one-cycle on M∨. The various constraints implicit in the theories above are Wf = 1 , Gv ≡ Zv ∏ ℓ⊃v Xℓ = 1 , G ∨ f = 1 . (34) Note that Gv takes matter into account, and hence it is not the same as the Gauss operator in a pure gauge theory. The ﬁrst requirement — that all gauge ﬁelds be topological/ﬂat in the gauged matter theory — means that all electric ﬁelds Xℓ have zero expectations except when they are multiplied to form the operators Tc. The second constraint, multiplied over all v, ensures that Q = 1 . 15 Twisting the Q = 1 singlet constraint in eq. (28) gives Xℓ1Xℓ2 = X ∨ ℓ , Zv = η∨ v W ∨ v , (35) and the singlet constraint in the matter theory is now Q = ∏v η∨ v . Making the twists dynamical corresponds to coupling a topological one-form gauge theory to the ordinary Z2 gauge theory.12 This is done by charging the electric ﬁelds of the ordinary gauge theory, i.e. by adding the one-form degrees of freedom and then by imposing the one-form Gauss constraint G∨ ℓ ≡ X ∨ ℓ1X ∨ ℓ X ∨ ℓ2 = 1 . (36) (Recall that ℓ1/2 are vertices at the ends of link ℓ, so X ∨ ℓ1/2 are operators on dual faces that share dual link ℓ.) The resulting duality is then Xv = X ∨ v , Zv = Z∨ v W ∨ v , (37) and the operators on the r.h.s. are precisely the one-form-gauge-invariant operators, i.e. the opera- tors that commute with the Gauss operators G∨ ℓ in (36). The theory on the r.h.s. will be called — perhaps unfortunately — a gauged Z2 gauge theory. The only constraints implicit in (37) are the one-form Gauss laws (36). Multiplying these over dual links ℓ ⊂ c gives back (30), namely T ∨ c = 1 . (38) When c is a contractible cycle, say the boundary of a face (c = ∂f ), this becomes the Gauss law, G∨ f = 1 . Thus the zero-form Gauss law is contained in the one-form Gauss law. When c is not contractible this is a constraint that makes sure that the holonomies W ∨ c all have vanishing expectations. Note that another map that follows from (37) is Q = W ∨ M ≡ ∏ v Z∨ v , (39) the relation between the ordinary symmetry generator of spin systems and the Wilson “surface” operator of the one-form gauge theory. 12The full algebra of a one-form Z2 gauge theory is generated by Z ∨ v and X ∨ v for all dual plaquettes v. The Gauss operators in a pure one-form theory are G ∨ ℓ = ∏ v⊂ℓ X ∨ v , which means that the gauge-invariant algebra is generated by X ∨ v and W ∨ M = ∏ v Z ∨ v for a connected spatial manifold/lattice. In d = 2, every one-form gauge theory is topological. 16 To recap, KW dualities involving Ising spins in d = 2 studied here are spins/Z2 = Z2 gauge theory∨/(Z2 one-form), topologically gauged spins = Z2 gauge theory∨, spins = gauged Z2 gauge theory∨. (40) As before, more dualities can be obtained from these. For instance, the second line above can be modiﬁed into a self-duality of two gauged spin systems, both with dynamical (not necessarily topological) gauge ﬁelds. 3.2 Jordan-Wigner and its twisting The higher-dimensional analogues of JW duality have been formulated as exact dualities only re- cently [5, 25] (see [5] for references on previous proposals on higher-dimensional bosonization). The key insight is that the Z2 gauge theory dual to a fermion theory has a nonstandard Gauss law. This law implements ﬂux attachment, i.e. it ensures that a magnetic ﬂux is also electrically charged. A similar constraint was encountered in eq. (26), where changing a magnetic ﬂux through the disk enclosed by the spatial circle also changed the electric charge at one of the sites on the circle. In the standard form of the d = 2 JW duality, as presented in [5], pairs of Majoranas live on sites in M and their bilinears map as ηℓSℓ = ̃X ∨ ℓ , Zv = W ∨ v . (41) Here Sℓ = −iχ′ ℓ1χℓ2 is the hopping generator associated to ℓ via a ﬁxed orientation of links on M. The dual lattice has Z2 variables living on its links, but the corresponding Gauss operators are ̃G∨ f ≡ G∨ f ∏ v: v0=f W ∨ v . (42) The product above goes over all dual faces v whose anchor v0 is precisely the dual vertex f .13 The Gauss law thus also causes a magnetic ﬂux through a dual face v to induce an electric charge at 13Each dual face is assumed to have one of its vertices chosen as an anchor. Just like vertices belonging to a link ℓ are labeled ℓ1/2 depending on the orientation, vertices of a face f can be canonically labeled f0/1/2/... if the orientations on links form a branching structure; then the vertex f0 is called the anchor of face f . Conversely, the anchor of a dual face v is a dual vertex denoted v0. The orientation of links on M induces at least one consistent assignment of anchors to dual faces on M∨, as discussed in the main text. If M satisﬁes some additional properties, there is an algorithmic way to ﬁnd the corresponding branching structure (and hence anchor assignment) on M∨ [16]. 17 the dual vertex v0. Gauge-invariant operators must commute with ̃G∨ f (but not necessarily with G∨ f = ∏ℓ⊂f X ∨ ℓ ), and the algebra of gauge-invariant operators is generated by Wilson loops W ∨ v on dual faces, by Wilson loops W ∨ c on noncontractible one-cycles c, and by modiﬁed electric ﬁeld operators ̃X ∨ ℓ ≡ X ∨ ℓ ∏ ℓ′⊂c(ℓ) Z∨ ℓ′ . (43) This product runs over all the links in the one-chain c(ℓ) ⊂ M∨ that connects the anchors of dual faces on the two sides of ℓ. Electric ﬁeld operators thus must come accompanied with a Wilson line on some of the adjacent links. This way operators ̃X ∨ ℓ on diﬀerent links ℓ can still fail to commute. For a ﬁxed orientation of links on M, the anchors and the chains c(ℓ) can be chosen on M∨ so ̃X ∨ ℓ are gauge-invariant and have the same commutation relations as Sℓ.14 Physically, ̃X ∨ ℓ transports a magnetic ﬂux together with its attached electric charge across the dual link ℓ. The duality (41) already comes with twists ηℓ included because on a generic lattice it is not possible to maintain consistency while setting them all to unity. Put another way, depending on the lattice, the fermions may need be coupled to a background gauge ﬁeld with nontrivial curvature in order to get a consistent duality. To illustrate this better, consider a simple (not self-intersecting), possibly contractible one-cycle c ∈ M. Traversing c in one direction (starting from an arbitrary site), the path-ordered product of hopping operators obeys ∏ ℓ⊂c Sℓ = − ∏′ v⊂c Zv, (44) where the primed product runs over all the vertices in c that connect links with the same orientation relative to the direction of traversal of c. If c encircles a single face f , i.e. if c = ∂f , then (44) is a vertex relation at dual vertex f : ∏ ℓ⊂f (ηℓ ̃X ∨ ℓ ) = − ∏′ v⊂f W ∨ v . (45) Thus (δη)f ≡ ∏ ℓ⊂f ηℓ (46) must be chosen so that, for a ﬁxed c(ℓ) in (43), the above product agrees in sign with the modiﬁed Gauss law ̃G∨ f = 1 based on eq. (42). Alternatively, a consistent duality can be obtained with ηℓ = 1 14This choice is not necessarily unique. Consider a square lattice M with all horizontal links oriented eastward, and all vertical links oriented northward. Then there are two choices per face for consistent ﬂux attachment: the anchor of every dual face can be either in its northeast or in its southwest corner. 18 everywhere but with a nontrivial background charge density in the dual theory. As in the KW case, “gauge transformations” of ηℓ do not aﬀect the consistency of the duality. When c is not contractible, eq. (44) is a constraint in the dual theory that can be written as15 1 = − ∏ ℓ⊂c Sℓ ∏′ v⊂c Zv = − ∏ ℓ⊂c (ηℓ ̃X ∨ ℓ ) ∏′ v⊂c W ∨ v ≡ ( ∏ ℓ⊂c ηℓ ) ̃T ∨ c , (47) In this notation, the singlet-singlet nature of duality (41) is clear: the constraints involved are Q = ∏ v Zv = 1 , ̃G∨ f = 1 , and ̃T ∨ c = ( ∏ ℓ⊂c ηℓ )1 (48) for a noncontractible c. In particular a “standard” JW duality could be deﬁned as the one where ̃T ∨ c = 1 , in analogy to how the “standard” KW has T ∨ c = 1 . Note that ̃T ∨ c transports one electric and one magnetic excitation along a cycle, and its path-ordering makes sure it does not change under deformations of c by contractible cycles. In toric code parlance [26], it is a particular realization of the operator that moves ε excitations along c. The twists ηℓ can now be promoted to quantum variables, as before. The new duality is SℓZℓ = ̃X ∨ ℓ , Zv = W ∨ v , Wc = ̃T ∨ c , Tc∨ = W ∨ c∨. (49) Once again the gauge ﬁeld on the fermion side must be placed in deﬁnite eigenstates of local Wilson loops Wf , but now the rule must be Wf = (δη)f , (50) which means that the duality can only be consistent on a generic lattice if the gauge ﬁelds are allowed to have the same nontrivial curvature that the background ﬁelds ηℓ used to have. Other 15Another way to write this is (−1) ϕ(c)T ∨ c W ∨ ̃c = 1 , with ϕ(c) ∈ Z2 determined by the η’s and by orientations of links near and on c. The cycle ̃c ⊂ M∨ is given by ̃c ≡ ∑ ℓ⊂c c(ℓ) + ∑′ v⊂c ∂∨v, where ∂∨ is the boundary operator on chains in M∨, so the dual one-cycles ∂∨v are boundaries of dual faces v that enter the product in eq. (45). The distinction between c and ̃c is one lattice analogue of the framing necessary to deﬁne line operators with spin in continuum theories. 19 required constraints are usual, Gv ≡ Zv ∏ ℓ⊃v Xℓ = 1 , ̃G∨ f = 1 . (51) The theory on the l.h.s. of (49) is simply the theory of free fermions coupled to a topological gauge ﬁeld. For particular classes of Hamiltonians, it can be interpreted as a theory in which all possible boundary conditions of fermions are summed over. The other singlet constraint in (41) can be twisted, too. The twisted duality only diﬀers by the mapping of Zv: ηℓSℓ = ̃X ∨ ℓ , Zv = η∨ v W ∨ v . (52) The vertex relation (45) now becomes ∏ ℓ⊂f (ηℓ ̃X ∨ ℓ ) = − ∏′ v⊂f (η∨ v W ∨ v ) . (53) In most cases it is possible to set ηℓ = 1 on all links, as ∏′ v⊂f η∨ v can be used to ﬁx the sign here. However, this is not guaranteed to work on every lattice: it may happen that there are no vertices on ∂f where the orientation of links does not change. Hence it is wiser to keep ηℓ ﬁxed at some value that makes η∨ v = 1 a consistent choice. It will be assumed that ∏ℓ⊂c ηℓ = 1 for a noncontractible cycle. With this convention in place, the above relation can also be written as ̃G∨ f = ∏′ v⊂f η∨ v . (54) The twisting also aﬀects the line operator ̃T ∨ c , changing the one-form symmetry singlet condition to ̃T ∨ c = ( ∏′ v⊂c η∨ v ) 1 . (55) Note that the singlet conditions all stay the same under “gauge transformations” that change the signs of η∨ v on two dual faces that share a dual link. Unlike all previous examples, it is impossible to simply promote this twisting by η∨ v into a coupling between the ﬂux-attached Z2 gauge theory and a two-form Z2 gauge theory. It is instructive to see how this fails. The ﬂux-attached Gauss constraint depends on the twist ﬁelds, as shown in 20 eq. (54), and it must be promoted into 1 = ̃G∨ f ∏′ v⊂f Z∨ v = −(δη)f ∏ ℓ⊂f ̃X ∨ ℓ ∏′ v⊂f (W ∨ v Z∨ v ) . (56) The one-form gauge constraint will be discussed below, but for now let ̃W ∨ v ≡ W ∨ v Z∨ v (57) be the tentative one-form-gauge-invariant version of the Wilson loop. (This object dualized to Zv in the KW version of this story, eq. (37).) In this notation the zero-form Gauss law (56) is ̂G∨ f ≡ ∏ ℓ⊂f ̃X ∨ ℓ ∏′ v⊂f ̃W ∨ v = −(δη)f . (58) Recall that the r.h.s. is ﬁxed by requiring consistency of the standard JW duality (41). Notice that now that the one-form gauge ﬁelds are present, the notion of ﬂux attachment in the ordinary gauge theory is obscured: the original ﬂux-attaching Gauss operator (42) is no longer gauge-invariant. The meaningful gauge constraint that supplants this old Gauss law is eq. (58). As already mentioned, it is impossible to get rid of the background magnetic ﬁelds (δη)f on a generic lattice. However, this is not the anomaly that prevents the twists η∨ v from being quantized. The obstacle lies in the fermionic nature of the one-form symmetry generated by line operators ̃T ∨ c on closed loops. In order to gauge this symmetry, a set of local Gauss operators ̂G∨ ℓ must be associated to the set of links on M∨. The one-form Gauss operator in (36) needs to be modiﬁed in order to get a meaningful gauge constraint. It cannot be used outright because X ∨ ℓ is not gauge-invariant under the zero-form gauge symmetry (i.e. X ∨ ℓ does not commute with ̂G∨ f ), and the natural generalization, ̃X ∨ ℓ X ∨ ℓ1X ∨ ℓ2, cannot be used because such operators on diﬀerent links do not necessarily commute with each other.16 Further modiﬁcations must be done by adding various factors of Z∨ v to ̃X ∨ ℓ X ∨ ℓ1X ∨ ℓ2, getting tentative one-form Gauss operators ̂G∨ ℓ = ̃X ∨ ℓ ∏ v⊂ℓ X ∨ v (Z∨ v ) αv(ℓ), αv(ℓ) ∈ Z2. (59) If ℓ is in the boundary ∂M∨, there are two options. It can have no dual faces adjacent to it, in which case it can be excluded from this analysis. Alternatively, ℓ can have one dual face adjacent to it, 16These operators also do not commute with the zero-form Gauss operator ̂G ∨ f in (58), but since ̂G ∨ f must be realized as a product of one-form Gauss operators along the dual of ∂f , this failure of commutativity simply follows from the failure of diﬀerent ̃X ∨ ℓ to commute. 21 in which case the corresponding one-form Gauss operator is assumed to be ̂G∨ ℓ ∝ X ∨ ℓ X ∨ ℓ1(Z∨ ℓ1)α(ℓ), where ℓ1 denotes the single dual face containing ℓ. For simplicity, the rest of this argument assumes that M∨ has no boundary. If the dual lattice M∨ is triangular, it is possible to choose the ̂G∨ ℓ ’s such that they all com- mute. However, it is never possible to make them individually commute with the zero-form Gauss operators. Even a more modest goal, to make the one-form operators consistent with the zero-form Gauss law via vertex relations, is also impossible. The claim that operators (59) cannot commute with ̂G∨ f is quickly established by inspection. A straightforward way to prove the rest of the claims from the above paragraph is as follows. Consider any dual lattice M∨ with some ﬁxed deﬁnition of ̃X ∨ ℓ ’s. The two requirements of interest are (i) that any two operators ̂G∨ ℓ , ̂G∨ ℓ′ commute, and (ii) that the ̂G∨ ℓ ’s be consistent with the zero-form Gauss law up to a sign by satisfying the vertex relation ∏ℓ⊂f ̂G∨ ℓ ∝ ̂G∨ f .17 Can these requirements be satisﬁed? Consider a dual vertex f with z(f ) dual links emanating from it. By req. (i), for any two links ℓ, ℓ′ ⊂ f that share a dual face, ̂G∨ ℓ and ̂G∨ ℓ′ must commute; this gives z(f ) constraints on the αv(ℓ)’s. This is done independently at each f , so there are ∑ f z(f ) = 2NL constraints of this type, with NL being the number of dual links in M∨. This is precisely enough to ﬁx all the αv(ℓ)’s. There are more constraints, however: it is simple to check that no req. (ii) can be satisﬁed with such αv(ℓ)’s. Moreover, if the lattice M∨ is not triangular, req. (i) is not exhausted yet either: one still needs to enforce the commutation of the ̂G∨ ℓ ’s on dual links that belong to the same dual face but that do not emanate from the same dual vertex. This proves both statements from the preceding paragraph. Note that this one-form anomaly is a property of the algebra, not of any particular Hamiltonian. Any zero-form gauge theory with ﬂux attachment, or more precisely any theory with a framing- dependent one-form symmetry, will run into the same issue: not all ̂G∨ ℓ ’s can be simultaneously projected to the singlet sector without violating the zero-form gauge symmetry. The next best alternative is to partially gauge the one-form symmetry, i.e. to project to the singlet sector of only those operators ̂G∨ ℓ that are zero-form gauge-invariant and that commute with each other. These must live on links ℓ whose adjacent dual faces ℓ1/2 do not contain anchors on ℓ; this means that an O(1) fraction of links may not able to support the desired ̂G∨ ℓ ’s. Such theories would thus need to be dual to fermions coupled to an entire additional ﬁeld theory. This analysis lies outside of the scope of this paper, but see [14] for further work in this direction. 17For every dual link ℓ, the operators that may fail to commute with ̃X ∨ ℓ are ̃X ∨ ℓ′ for ℓ ′ ⊂ ℓ1/2; the ansatz (59) guarantees that when ℓ and ℓ ′ do not share a dual face, the corresponding Gauss operators ̂G ∨ ℓ and ̂G ∨ ℓ′ commute. 22 To recap, JW in d = 2 involves a more limited web of dualities due to the associated anomalous one-form symmetries. Two dualities of interest are fermions η/Z2 = Z2 ﬂux-attached gauge theory ∨/(Z2 one-form), topologically gauged fermionsη = Z2 ﬂux-attached gauge theory ∨. (60) The superscript η is a reminder here that fermions may need to be coupled to a nontrivial background Z2 connection ηℓ to make the duality consistent, even if the fermionic theory is well-deﬁned on its own. Once ηℓ is promoted to a dynamical gauge ﬁeld, the duality is well-deﬁned if the gauge ﬁeld is topological with ﬁxed curvature (δη)f . Unlike in d = 1, here there is no natural theory to use as a reference point when deﬁning the boundary conditions of fermions. A diﬀerent choice of the background gauge ﬁeld ηℓ on the fermion side can change what one means by boundary conditions. Nevertheless, the notion of summing over boundary conditions remains perfectly well-deﬁned: this is precisely the procedure of promoting the background ﬁelds ηℓ into quantum degrees of freedom. In any d > 1, this sum over boundary conditions will always be equivalent to coupling to a Z2 gauge ﬁeld in the usual way, as done in (49). It is only in d = 1 that the sum over fermion boundary conditions may require the unusual Gauss law (26) and the correspondingly unusual map (27). 3.3 Comments on orientations, dimers, and spin structures It is well known that boundary conditions along noncontractible cycles for fermions on a space X are closely associated to spin structures on X.18 This connection has several manifestations on both continuous and discrete spaces. The classic physical approach to spin structures comes from relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory on an orientable D-dimensional manifold X, where representations of the Lorentz group can be spinorial. A ﬁeld in such a representation is a section of a spinor bundle. This spinor bundle is obtained by uplifting from the tangent bundle, with a Z2 connection specifying the additional data needed for this uplift. (In Euclidean signature, this is a lift from SO(D) to Spin(D) connections.19.) This extra piece of data is the spin structure, and on a smooth manifold its only detectable signature is a Z2-valued holonomy along noncontractible cycles. These holonomies can be interpreted as periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions for spinors governed by a Dirac Lagrangian. According to the spin-statistics connection, these spinors must be fermions, 18Note that M is always used to denote the spatial manifold or lattice, while X may also be a spacetime. 19Note that π1(SO(D)) = Z2 for D > 2, while π1(SO(2)) = Z. In any D, Spin(D) is such that SO(D) = Spin(D)/Z2, but only for D = 2 this means Spin(2) = SO(2). The subtlety of spin connections in D = 2 vs. D > 2 will be discussed at the end of this subsection, and also in subsection 4.3 23 and this is how fermions get associated to spin structures. This familiar story relies on X being a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold. Spin structures, however, are Z2 connections and can be naturally deﬁned on lattices. One way to do so is to start from the discrete version of the second Stiefel-Whitney class, which is a certain Z2 two-cocycle w2 on the lattice X for which very explicit formulæ are given in [27, 28].20 The spin structure ξ is then any one-cochain that satisﬁes w2 = δξ. (If w2 is not exact, then X does not admit spin structures; this does not happen to orientable lattices in D ≤ 3.) This ξ can be regarded as a classical Z2 gauge ﬁeld, and once w2 is ﬁxed, the only “gauge-invariant” data contained in ξ are precisely the values of its holonomies along noncontractible cycles. If X is a lattice in two dimensions, i.e. if it can be smoothly embedded into a 2D surface, then spin structures can also be deﬁned via Z2 quadratic forms on one-cycles following [11, 29, 30]. The idea here is to deﬁne Z2-valued functions qξ(c) that act on one-cycles c ∈ X and satisfy qξ(c + c ′) = qξ(c) + qξ(c ′) + c · c ′, (61) where c · c′ is the bilinear intersection form that measures the number of intersections (mod 2) of the two chains c, c′. The space of such forms qξ(c) is 22g-dimensional, where g is the genus of X. The distinct basis labels ξ correspond to nonequivalent spin structures; for each ξ, qξ assigns a Z2 variable to each noncontractible cycle. Having learned about discrete spin structures, one may ask whether they may be connected to fermionic quantum theories on lattices. Remarkably, a connection between fermionic theories and spin structures persists even in a discrete setup. There are two diﬀerent avatars of this connection in the literature, and they correspond to the two deﬁnitions of discrete spin structures given above. The relation between fermions and spin structures as quadratic forms on 2D surfaces has an interesting background. The oldest chapter of this story is a set of dualities established within statistical mechanics by Kasteleyn and Fisher [31, 32]. In modern words, these dualities relate Ising spins on a 2D lattice ̃X to dimer models21 on an associated lattice X, which are in turn related 20A few warnings on conventions: the Stiefel-Whitney classes used in this paper are all Z2 ones. The integral Stiefel-Whitney classes are used to deﬁne spinc structures but will not be explored here. Further, the given references deﬁne Stiefel-Whitney classes as cycles, not cocycles, so their deﬁnitions need to be appropriately (Poincar´e-)dualized. Finally, the second Stiefel-Whitney class is typically deﬁned as a Z2 two-cocycle, meaning that it is a function assigning an element of Z2 = {0, 1} to each face. However, it is more convenient to work with its exponential taking values in {±1}, and this is what w2 will mean in this paper. 21A dimer model on a lattice X has as its degrees of freedom diﬀerent perfect matchings of adjacent vertices on X. In other words, each conﬁguration is a way of assigning 0 or 1 to the links in X such that each vertex has exactly one 1-link (dimer) emanating from it. Each link ℓ ∈ X is assigned a weight w(ℓ), and the weight of each dimer conﬁguration (set of 1-links) D is simply w(D) ≡ ∏ ℓ∈D w(ℓ), giving the partition function Z = ∑ D w(D). 24 to spinless fermions hopping on X in the presence of an unusual topological gauge ﬁeld wK, to be described below. According to the prescription of [32], if ̃X has a time direction (e.g. it is a discretization of the two-torus or a plane), X does not have a corresponding time direction, so it may appear that this duality has no interpretation in the Hamiltonian framework, despite the natural guess that it is just a Euclidean version of (27). The unusual nature of gauge ﬁelds that couple to fermions on X appears to restore a Hamiltonian interpretation to this theory in this case. More recent is Kuperberg’s connection between dimer conﬁgurations on the 2D lattice X and spin structures on surfaces in which X may be embedded [33]. Combining this connection with the dimer-fermion duality and the deﬁnition of spin structures as quadratic forms (61), Cimasoni and Reshetikhin showed that a dimer conﬁguration D and an appropriate (“Kasteleyn”) choice of link orientations K canonically induce a Z2 quadratic form qD,K on X [11]. This gives a precise way to identify the topological gauge ﬁelds/Kasteleyn orientations with spin structures, and the statistical mechanics of dimers is then dual to that of fermions coupled to dynamical spin structures. Combining this with the Ising-dimer duality, this gives the map between Ising spins and “gauged” fermions: ZIsing ∝ ∑ K εD, K Arf(qD, K) ∫ dχ exp { ∑ ⟨u,v⟩ wK(u, v)χuχv }. (62) Here K labels diﬀerent (possibly gauge-equivalent) spin structures/Kasteleyn orientations/“gauge ﬁeld” conﬁgurations, εD, K is a sign whose explicit dependence on D, K is given in [11], and the Arf invariant is a standard function on Z2 quadratic forms in 2D [34]. The summand is independent of D and is invariant under “gauge transformations” that change the orientation K of all links emanating from one site.22 The integral is the standard Berezin path integral. Its evaluation yields the Pfaﬃan of the antisymmetric matrix wK, whose nonzero entries are the “gauge ﬁelds” wK(ℓ1, ℓ2) = −wK(ℓ2, ℓ1) ≡ w(ℓ), (63) where w(ℓ) are the link weights from the dimer model (see footnote 21). This is an unusual gauge ﬁeld because it depends on the orientation; it is topological because its action, εD, K Arf(qD, K), does not depend on the ﬁeld strength but only on the holonomies along noncontractible cycles. Note that this property is built into the deﬁnition of K: an orientation is Kasteleyn if its “curvature” (i.e. the product of wK(u, v) over a one-cycle bounding a face) is equal to −1.23 Another avatar of the nonrelativistic link between spin structures and fermions is well rep- 22The need for a ﬁducial D becomes more natural in view of the fact that lattice spinors are naturally deﬁned via a perfect matching of spinless fermions [35]. A similar observation was made in [36]. 23With some extra assumptions on the lattices involved, Cimasoni has further shown how to extend this story to Dirac fermions on 2D lattices [37]. 25 resented in the recent work by Kapustin and collaborators [12, 14, 15]. Compared to the ideas mentioned in the previous passage, these authors have studied a more straightforward set of KW and JW dualities in topological ﬁeld theories, both via Hamiltonian methods and discrete path integrals (“state sums”). Promoting twist ﬁelds to quantum variables in JW dualities was called “gauging fermion parity” (for zero-form symmetries) and “anyon condensation” (for one-form sym- metries). In D = 2, a picture similar to Kasteleyn’s was found, with the Arf invariant appearing in the action of spin structures when they were dynamical [15]. In D ≥ 3, the information on the spin structure was inferred from the anomaly of the one-form symmetry, i.e. by studying which additional degrees of freedom need to be introduced in order to get a consistent one-form-gauged theory [14]. By carrying out the analogue of the state sum approach in the Hamiltonian framework, it was shown that the notion of spin structures deﬁned via discrete Stiefel-Whitney classes of the spatial manifold coincides with the information contained in the structure of one-form anomalies. The twist (49) of the standard JW duality (41) in the present paper is the dual of this story: here the notion of summing over spin structures is uncovered via gauging the nonanomalous zero-form symmetry of fermions, not the one-form symmetry of the dual ﬂux-attached gauge theory. Several lessons about the connection between spin structures and Z2 gauge ﬁelds can be drawn from the past two sections and from this blitz review of previous results: 1. In all dimensions, a spin structure can be realized as a topological gauge ﬁeld whose gauge group is the Z2 fermion parity. It can be deﬁned in any theory in which the operator algebra is generated by fermion bilinears, i.e. in which fermion parity is a kinematic symmetry. (It is not necessary to assume the theory is topological, as in [14].) If the spin structure is a classical (background) ﬁeld, the theory can be called a spin theory. If it is a quantum (dynamical) ﬁeld, the theory is a non-spin theory. This nomenclature is consistent with the deﬁnition of spin topological ﬁeld theories. 2. In a spin theory, the dependence on the spin structure does not enter at the level of the operator algebra. In fact, the spin structure is not distinguishable from the couplings in the Hamiltonian. Only changes in the spin structure can be deﬁned unambiguously — this is why the space of spin structures is aﬃne. One way to deﬁne what one means by a theory with a speciﬁc spin structure is to pick a reference Hamiltonian built out of fermion bilinears. For example, if the reference Hamiltonian is ∑ ℓ ηℓSℓ, then changing the ηℓ’s while keeping (δη)f ﬁxed will give a theory with distinct boundary conditions — i.e. a diﬀerent spin structure — if the ηℓ’s are changed in a topologically nontrivial way (otherwise the changes can be absorbed by a phase shift of the matter operators). Another way to deﬁne a reference Hamiltonian is 26 via duality: as shown in this paper, diﬀerent spin structures can be identiﬁed with diﬀerent singlet/singlet dualities. Thus in d = 1 one can pick, say, the Ising Hamiltonian (2) in the singlet sector and dualize it (with ηℓ = 1) to get a reference Hamiltonian for the fermionic system. 3. The space of spin structures is spanned by holonomies ∏ℓ⊂c ηℓ over noncontractible cycles, i.e. by gauge-inequivalent ﬁelds η that all have the same ﬁeld strength δη. This is very reminiscent of the deﬁnition of spin structures ξ as inequivalent solutions to δξ = w2. These two approaches can in fact coincide if the conventions from subsection 3.2 are adjusted in the following way. Recall that the vertex relation (45) can be consistent with (δη)f = 1 as long as the dual Z2 theory with ﬂux-attachment is endowed with a nontrivial background charge density, with some Gauss constraints in (42) being ̃G∨ f = −1 . If this background charge is included in the deﬁnition of the gauge theory, the equation (δη)f = 1 will then be the same (up to an irrelevant overall sign) as the equation obeyed by ξ, as the second Stiefel-Whitney class on any orientable 2D lattice is the constant two-cocycle, (w2)f = −1. In higher dimensions, more interesting choices of w2 will be possible, but the discussion is the same as here [25]. 4. In the Hamiltonian framework, d = 1 is a special dimension. Trivially, there is no deﬁnition of spin structures via Stiefel-Whitney classes here. More interestingly, though, only in this case can a Z2 gauge ﬁeld be traded (via gauge-ﬁxing) for a single Z2 degree of freedom, so a theory whose algebra has individual fermionic operators (not just fermion bilinears) can be interpreted as a non-spin theory (this is how the original JW duality is understood in (27)). Further, spin structures in d = 1 can be promoted to dynamical Z2 gauge ﬁelds but their Gauss constraint may be of the unusual form (cf. (26)) that includes nonlocal holonomies. 5. Correspondingly, in statistical mechanics/state sum constructions, D = 2 is a special dimen- sion. There is again a certain leeway in deﬁning spin structures. They can be deﬁned as usual topological Z2 gauge ﬁelds like in eq. (16), or as unusual topological gauge ﬁelds (Kasteleyn orientations). In this “unusual” case they enter the partition function weighted by the Arf in- variant, cf. (62). It would be interesting to understand whether the unusual Gauss constraints in d = 1 and unusual gauge ﬁelds in D = 2 are connected by a conceptual link that the Arf term in the action hints at. 6. In higher dimensions, spin structures are ordinary topological Z2 gauge ﬁelds, background or dynamical, that couple to fermions. In state sum constructions of non-spin theories, their ac- tions are ordinary weak coupling Kogut-Susskind actions [24], perhaps with background ﬂuxes 27 turned on as required by the vertex relations analogous to (45), but without any dependence on nonlocal operators (holonomies) that the Arf invariant had introduced in d = 1. 4 ZK dualities All dualities in the previous section involved theories with Z2 target spaces. This class of theories is particularly natural because it includes pure fermion theories in any dimension. However, all duality webs discussed so far admit a generalization to arbitrary ZK theories. JW-type dualities now become maps between bosonic and parafermionic theories, which are less familiar — in part because they exhibit less interesting critical phenomena above d = 1, largely as a result of constraints due to Lorentz symmetry and the spin-statistics relation. On the other hand, KW maps remain of great interest in these cases, especially in the K → ∞ limit which reveals particle-vortex and related dualities. Consider a bosonic matter theory with K degrees of freedom per site — a clock model. Let ω ≡ e2πi/K (64) and note that ωK = 1. The generalizations of Pauli matrices Z and X to K > 2 are Φ =         1 ω . . . ωK−1         , Π =         1 1 1 . . .         . (65) They obey ΦnΠm = ωnmΠmΦn, Φ−1 = Φ† = ΦK−1, Π−1 = Π† = ΠK−1. A typical Hamiltonian is HK = 1 2M ∑ v (Πv + Π−1 v ) + 1 2 ∑ ⟨u,v⟩ (Φ−1 u Φv + Φ−1 v Φu) + ∑ v V ( 1 2 (Φv + Φ−1 v )) . (66) It is often useful to let Φv ≡ eiφv and to assume that, at K ≫ 1, states with slowly varying φv eigenvalues form the low energy eﬀective theory. Then the above model can be approximated by the familiar compact scalar Lagrangian HK≫1 ≈ 1 2M ∑ v d 2 dφ2 v − 1 2 ∑ ⟨u,v⟩(φu − φv) 2 + ∑ v V (cos φv). (67) Deep in the IR, the ﬂuctuations of the scalar ﬁeld φ may be small, in which case the model is well 28 described by the most familiar scalar ﬁeld theory, the noncompact (real-valued) scalar ﬁeld. Gauge theories with a ZK group can be deﬁned using operators Φℓ, Πℓ from (65) on links, but this time orientations are important even without ﬂux attachment. As before, ℓ1, ℓ2 denote the vertices in ℓ such that the link is oriented from ℓ1 to ℓ2. A useful notation is Φℓ1,ℓ2 = Φ −1 ℓ2,ℓ2 ≡ Φℓ, (68) and the same for Πℓ. In addition, Φu,v ≡ 1 and Πu,v ≡ 1 if u, v do not belong to the same link. The Gauss operators in the pure ZK gauge theory are Gv = ∏ u Πv,u. (69) Generators of the gauge-invariant algebra are Πℓ and the Wilson loops Wf = |f |∏ i=1 Φvi,vi+1, (70) where the vertices {vi} in f are ordered counter-clockwise, and |f | is the number of vertices in f . Of course, if the lattice has noncontractible cycles c, Wilson loops Wc must be added to the set of generators. Just like in the scalar case, it is often useful to let Φℓ ≡ eiAℓ and to consider states where Aℓ varies slowly across the lattice. At K ≫ 1 this gives back the compact U(1) gauge theory. (More precisely, to get U(1) from ZK, K must be taken to inﬁnity ﬁrst, before the large lattice or weak coupling limits [40].) Finally, parafermion analogues ζ, ξ of Majorana operators χ, χ′ are deﬁned such that ζ K v = ξK v = 1 , ζ † v = ζ −1 v , ξ† v = ξ−1 v (71) and ζuζv = ωζvζu, ξuξv = ωξvξu, for u < v, ζuξv = ωξvζu for u ≤ v, ζuξv = ω−1ξvζu, for u > v. (72) Here an absolute ordering of the vertices has been chosen. Note that a simpler relation, ζuζv = ωζvζu for all (u, v), cannot simultaneously hold for both (u, v) and for (v, u), because ω ̸= ω−1 for K > 2. In d = 1, it is possible to let ξv ≡ ζv+ 1 2 , unifying the relations (72) into just ζuζv = ωζvζu for u < v. For more details on parafermions in d = 1, see [38]. 29 4.1 Kramers-Wannier and its twisting The standard KW dualities (3) and (28) remain intact as Z2 is generalized to ZK. However, in order to make contact with familiar continuum notions, it is useful to consider the “conjugate” dualities obtained by swapping position and momentum operators in the Z2 expressions. In d = 1, the map of interest is Πv = (Φ ∨ v− 1 2 )†Φ ∨ v+ 1 2 , Φ† v−1Φv = Π ∨ v− 1 2 . (73) Consistency requires Q ≡ ∏ v Πv = 1 , Q ∨ ≡ ∏ v Π ∨ v = 1 , (74) where Q and Q∨ generate a global ZK symmetry. The Hamiltonian (66) is invariant under this symmetry only if V = 0; at K → ∞ this becomes the U(1) shift symmetry φv ↦→ φv + 2π/K familiar from the case of the free scalar. The duality can be written as −i d dφv = φ∨ v+ 1 2 − φ∨ v− 1 2 , φv − φv−1 = −i d dφ∨ v . (75) In the more common continuum path integral notation in D = 2, in a speciﬁc convention for directions of derivatives, this duality becomes ∂µφ = ϵ µν∂νφ∨. (76) Note that (76) holds only at long distances and with K → ∞ taken ﬁrst, while the duality (73) holds exactly on the lattice, for any K. Both are self-dualities, just like (3). The singlet condition Q = 1 means that the zero-momentum mode φ0 ≡ 1 N ∑ v φv is not dynamical. It is the only mode that changes under the shift symmetry, and so Q = 1 forces all physical states to be singlet eigenstates of φ0, i.e. tensor products of arbitrary nonzero mode states with the zero mode state 1√K ∑K n=1 | 2πn K ⟩. This map can be twisted by ηv− 1 2 , η∨ v ∈ {1, ω, . . . , ωK−1}, getting Πv = η∨ v (Φ∨ v− 1 2 ) †Φ∨ v+ 1 2 , ηv− 1 2 Φ† v−1Φv = Π ∨ v− 1 2 , (77) 30 with consistency equations Q = ∏v η∨ v and Q∨ = ∏v ηv+ 1 2 . Promoting, say, η∨ v to a dynamical ZK gauge ﬁeld, this becomes a duality between a gauged scalar theory and a full (non-singlet) scalar theory, Πv = (Φ ∨ v− 1 2 ) †Φ∨ v Φ∨ v+ 1 2 , Φ† v = Π ∨ v , (78) with the usual gauge constraint G∨ v+ 1 2 = (Π∨ v )†Π∨ v+ 1 2 Π∨ v+1. (Note the appearance of Φ † v in the second line.) In the continuum notation analogous to (76), still keeping lattice spacings equal to unity, this is ∂µφ = ϵ µν(A∨ ν + ∂νφ∨), φ = ϵ µνF ∨ µν. (79) Finally, there is an interesting extra twist to the twisting story here: the twist ﬁelds can come with various charges. Consider twisting (73) into Πv = (Φ∨ v− 1 2 )†Φ ∨ v+ 1 2 , ηq v− 1 2 Φ† v−1Φv = Π ∨ v− 1 2 . (80) The singlet constraints are now Q = 1 and Q∨ = ∏v ηq v− 1 2 . Upon promoting the η’s to gauge ﬁelds, the second constraint becomes W q = Q ∨, (81) and the gauge constraint is Gv ≡ Π† v− 1 2 Πq v Πv+ 1 2 = 1 . (82) A theory where matter has charge q will be called a q-gauged theory. Note that the Gauss law implies the constraint Q q = 1 , (83) but the ﬁrst line of the duality (80) still implies Q = 1 . (84) If K = qr for some integer r, then the gauged clock model has a gauge group “broken” to Zr [39]. More precisely, the matter only couples to a Zr subgroup of the gauge ﬁeld, and the remaining Zq 31 symmetry of the clock model is simply projected to the singlet sector to ensure the consistency of the duality. The dual theory is also in the singlet sector of the Zq subgroup; here the q’th power of individual Φ∨ v+ 1 2 operators now becomes physical, giving the duality Πv+ 1 2 = (Φ∨ v+ 1 2 )q, Πv = (Φ∨ v− 1 2 )†Φ ∨ v+ 1 2 , Φ† v−1Φq v− 1 2 Φv = Π ∨ v− 1 2 . (85) The r.h.s. can be interpreted as q copies of a Zr clock model with eﬀective position operators (Φ∨ v+ 1 2 )q, momentum operators Π∨ v+ 1 2 , and orbifold (twist) operators Φ∨ v+ 1 2 — essentially q’th roots of the eﬀective position operators, whose action is to shift from one copy of the theory to the other. The charge Q∨ = ∏v Π∨ v+ 1 2 combines both the Zr and Zq charges of this system; the Zq part (the “replica symmetry”) is generated by (Q∨)r, and by (81) this symmetry must be in its singlet sector: the r.h.s. is really a Zq orbifold of a Zr clock model. The Zr charge (the shift symmetry of the eﬀective Zr clock model) is fully dynamical. To summarize, d = 1 lattice dualities exhibited so far are ZK clock model/ZK = ZK clock model∨/ZK, ZK clock model = gauged ZK clock model∨, q-gauged ZK clock model/Zq = Zq-orbifolded ZK/q clock model∨. (86) In the continuum, as K → ∞, the dualities discussed above were compact scalar/U(1) = compact scalar ∨/U(1), compact scalar = gauged compact scalar ∨. (87) Note that more dualities can be unearthed in straightforward ways: for instance, the continuum models also admit dualities of orbifolded compact scalars. In d = 2, the situation is again a straightforward generalization of the Z2 analysis. The standard duality is between a ZK scalar theory and a pure ZK gauge theory with Gauss operators (69), Φ† ℓ1Φℓ2 = Π ∨ ℓ , Πv = W ∨ v . (88) 32 Note which of the two Φ’s enters the duality conjugated. This choice follows from the rule that link orientations on M∨ are induced by a π/2 clockwise rotation of the orientation of links on M. When K → ∞, these duality relations at long distances can be written as ∂µφ = ϵ µνλF ∨ νλ. (89) This is the familiar particle-vortex duality.24 Note that it holds only for theories whose Hamiltonians do not contain φ operators, as those would clash with the requirement that the scalar theory be in the singlet sector of the shift symmetry. The dual gauge theory is in the singlet sector of a one-form ZK symmetry generated by analogues of T ∨ c in (30). In any d, the above duality generalizes to a map between a zero-form φ and a (d − 1)-form B∨ (d−1) given by dφ = ⋆dB∨ (d−1). (90) Note that the Hodge star maps between original and dual lattices in the underlying microscopic theory. These expressions make sense as path integral variable maps on a (d + 1)-dimensional spacetime. There are two diﬀerent ways to twist the duality (88). One is ηℓΦ† ℓ1Φℓ2 = Π ∨ ℓ , Πv = W ∨ v , (91) and promoting the twists to topological gauge ﬁelds gives Φ† ℓ1ΦℓΦℓ2 = Π ∨ ℓ , Πv = W ∨ v . (92) The l.h.s. is a ZK scalar theory coupled to topological gauge ﬁelds, and the r.h.s. is a pure ZK gauge theory without any singlet constraints. In the continuum, K → ∞ notation, this is Aµ + ∂µφ = ϵ µνλF ∨ νλ. (93) Generalizing as before to arbitrary d, this becomes a duality between a gauged zero-form φ and a 24More precisely, as mentioned in the introduction, this is the compact/“weak” part of the particle-vortex duality [1]. There has recently been a ﬂurry of activity investigating the noncompact particle/vortex dualities, in which the scalar ﬁeld on at least one side of the duality is not compact. These dualities are typically not exact and will not be addressed here. 33 (d − 1) form B∨ (d−1), given by A + dφ = ⋆dB∨ (d−1). (94) Note that, unlike (90), the (d − 1)-form theory is not in the one-form singlet sector. The other twist of (88) is Φ† ℓ1Φℓ2 = Π ∨ ℓ , Πv = η∨ v W ∨ v , (95) which forces the singlet constraint for the matter theory to be Q = ∏v η∨ v . The twists are promoted to one-form gauge ﬁelds just as in (37). The continuum duality that follows involves a one-form gauge ﬁeld — i.e. a two-form B∨ µν — and in some choice of sign conventions for continuum ﬁelds it reads ∂µφ = ϵ µνλ(B∨ νλ + F ∨ νλ), φ = ϵ µνλ∂µB∨ νλ. (96) Compare this to the d = 1 case, (79). It is now straightforward to extrapolate and conclude that the KW (or particle-vortex) duality in any d maps a scalar theory of a ﬁeld φ to a theory of a (d − 1)-form gauge ﬁeld B∨ (d−1), whose one-form symmetry is gauged by coupling to a d-form B∨ (d), dφ = ⋆ (dB∨ (d−1) + B∨ (d)), φ = ⋆dB∨ (d). (97) To summarize, the lattice d = 2 dualities discussed here were ZK clock model/ZK = ZK gauge theory∨/(ZK one-form), ZK clock model = gauged ZK gauge theory∨, topologically gauged ZK clock model = ZK gauge theory. (98) The continuum dualities emerging from them are examples of particle-vortex duality: compact scalar/U(1) = U(1) gauge theory/(U(1) one-form), compact scalar = gauged U(1) gauge theory, topologically gauged compact scalar = U(1) gauge theory. (99) 34 As in d = 1, there are more dualities not presented here. In particular, orbifolds and their duals can be easily constructed. 4.2 Fradkin-Kadanoﬀ and its twisting The standard parafermion-boson duality in d = 1 was presented in [20] by Fradkin and Kadanoﬀ (FK) as a direct generalization of the JW map (12). Using conventions from (71) and (72), the FK duality is ζv = Π1 . . . Πv−1Φv, ξv = ω(K+1)/2Π1 . . . Πv−1ΠvΦv. (100) For K = 2, letting Π ↦→ Z and Φ ↦→ X, eq. (100) reproduces the JW duality. (Note that, just like in the previous subsection, the roles of position and momentum operators are reversed compared to the original Z2 duality.) The factor of ω(K+1)/2 is a convention; to get ξK v = 1 , it is enough to take any power ωx such that x + 1 2 (K − 1) ∈ Z. The choice x = 1 2 (K + 1) allows (100) to reduce to (12) when K = 2. Experience from subsection 3.2 suggests that a more local, singlet/singlet version of the FK duality will be more amenable to twisting and generalizing to higher d. To this end, consider introducing the parafermion bilinears Πv ≡ ω(K+1)/2ζ † vξv, hence Π† v = ω(K−1)/2ξ† vζv, Σuv ≡ ω(K−1)/2ζ † uξv, hence Σ† uv = ω(K+1)/2ξ† vζu. (101) (Recall that ζ and ξ generalize χ and χ′, respectively: thus it is Π† and Σ† that are direct gener- alizations of Z and S from (13).) The parafermion hopping operators between adjacent sites, and their FK duals, are Σv+1,v = Φ † v+1Φv, Σv,v+1 = Φ † vΠvΠv+1Φv+1. (102) In particular, Πv and Σv+1,v generate the algebra that commutes with Q = ∏v Πv. They can be used to construct singlet/singlet dualities. The nontrivial commutation relations between these operators are ΠvΣv+1,v = ω−1Σv+1,vΠv, Πv+1Σv+1,v = ωΣv+1,vΠv+1, ΠvΣv,v+1 = ωΣv,v+1Πv, Πv+1Σv,v+1 = ω−1Σv,v+1Πv+1. (103) 35 The most apparent singlet/singlet FK duality is thus simply Σv+1,v ≡ ω(K−1)/2ζ † v+1ξv = Φ † v+1Φv, ω(K+1)/2ζ † vξv = Πv. (104) This generalizes (22) and assumes that ζN +1 ≡ ζ1. The second line gives the parafermionic expres- sion for the ZK symmetry generator (parafermion number mod K), Q = ωN (K+1)/2 ∏ v ζ † vξv. (105) The ﬁrst line in (104) leads, via repeated application of eqs. (72), to the singlet constraint 1 = ωN (K−1)/2ζ † 2ξ1ζ † 3ξ2 · · · ζ † 1ξN = ωN (K+1)/2−1ζ † 1ξ1 · · · ζ † N ξN = ω−1 Q, (106) or Q = ω1 for short. Two twists of (104) are possible, as before, but in d = 1 they both land on the original FK map (100) once the twists go dynamical. In subsection 2.3 the fermionic side was twisted, so just to liven things up, now consider twisting the bosonic side instead: Σv+1,v = η∗ v+ 1 2 Φ† v+1Φv, ω(K+1)/2ζ † vξv = Πv. (107) The singlet constraint becomes Q = ω ∏v η∗ v+ 1 2 1 , or QW = ω1 (108) after the twists are promoted into ZK gauge ﬁelds. The same kind of unusual gauge constraint (26) can now be imposed, and the story is entirely analogous. The d = 1 FK dualities are thus ZK parafermions = ZK clock model, ZK parafermions/ZK = ZK clock model/ZK, ZK parafermions = ﬂux-attached gauged ZK clock model. (109) As in the previous subsection, it is further possible to orbifold these models at the expense of introducing Zr gauge ﬁelds on the other side of the duality. These dualities will not be presented here. 36 In d = 2, duals of parafermion theories on M are ﬂux-attached ZK gauge theories on M∨. As parafermions in higher dimensions are not frequently discussed, it may be useful to overview the structure of this theory without reference to dualities. As mentioned above, an absolute ordering of vertices is needed to specify the parafermion operator algebra. This ordering will also induce link orientations: for every link ℓ, its vertices can be labeled ℓ1/2 such that ℓ1 > ℓ2, and the link will be oriented from ℓ1 to ℓ2. This orientation choice is not necessary, and it does not agree with the d = 1 orientation used above, but it simpliﬁes the following analysis. The parafermion bilinears of interest are d = 2 generalizations of (101), Πv = ω(K+1)/2ζ † vξv, Σℓ = ω(K−1)/2ζ † ℓ1ξℓ2. (110) As usual, Σℓ will also be denoted Σℓ1, ℓ2. The commutation relations are obtained from eq. (72), and the most important ones are Πℓ1Σℓ = ωΣℓΠℓ1, Πℓ2Σℓ = ω−1ΣℓΠℓ2, ΣuvΣvw = ΣvwΣuv, ΣuvΣwv = ω−θ(u,w)ΣwvΣuv. (111) where θ(u, w) = 1 if u > w, and θ(u, w) = −1 if u < w. Just like in the fermionic case, the hopping operators Σℓ commute if the links do not share a vertex (or, if they do share one, if one ﬂows into it while the other emanates out of it), all operators Πv commute with each other, and the entire algebra generated by {Πv, Σℓ} has a center generated by Q = ∏v Πv, the parafermion number mod K. Unlike the ordinary fermion story, the commutation relations of hopping operators involve the curious factor of ω−θ(u,w). Its only rˆole appears to be to alter the ﬂux attachment rules by replacing certain powers of ω with ω−1. On regular lattices there appears to be no issue due to its presence, but it is not clear if it makes any duality inconsistent on some more generic triangulation. There is a vertex relation along each face f ∈ M, namely |f |∏ i=1 Σvivi+1 = ω−1 |f |∏ i=1 Πvi. (112) Due to the absolute ordering, no one-cycle can have all links oriented the same way relative to the direction of traversal of the cycle. To deal with the resulting Σ’s going in the “wrong” direction, it is useful to note that Σℓ2ℓ1 = ω−1Σ† ℓ1ℓ2Πℓ1Πℓ2 = Πℓ1Σ† ℓΠℓ2. (113) 37 Using this identity, eq. (112) can, up to a power of ω, be written as ∏ ℓ⊂f Σ o(ℓ;f ) ℓ ∝ ∏′ v⊂f Π o(v;f ) v . (114) This is a generalization of the vertex relation (44), with primes again denoting that the product runs over those sites that join links traversing ∂f along the same direction. On the l.h.s. the signs o(ℓ; f ) are +1 if ℓ is oriented counter-clockwise along ∂f , and −1 if ℓ is oriented clockwise. On the r.h.s, o(v; f ) is +1 if v joins links that are both counter-clockwise along ∂f , and −1 if v joins links that are both clockwise. It should by now be clear that the appropriate generalization of the FK duality (104) to d = 2, and of the JW duality (41) to ZK, is ηℓΣℓ = ̃Π∨ ℓ , Πv = W ∨ v . (115) As before, some background ﬁelds ηℓ need to be coupled to the parafermions to make sure the vertex relations (114) all map to a consistent Gauss law ̃G∨ f = 1 : the background ﬂux (δη)f must be chosen to match the proportionality constant in this relation at each f . Alternatively, all ηℓ can be set to unity but the dual gauge theory must be coupled to a nontrivial background charge density. This form of the duality is consistent with the rule that link orientations on M∨ are obtained by rotating those on M by π/2 counter-clockwise. Note that this happens to be the opposite convention from the one in subsection 4.1. The rules of ﬂux attachment on M∨ (anchor assignment and framing rules c(ℓ) of line operators ̃Π∨ ℓ , cf. (43)) are, as before, mostly ﬁxed by commutation relations, i.e. by orientation choices on M. For instance, on the square lattice as in footnote 14, there are still two consistent choices of ﬂux attachment per face. The ZK gauge theory (115) is in the singlet sector of the anomalous one-form ZK symmetry, while the parafermions are in the singlet sector of the zero-form symmetry generated by Q. Gauging the latter symmetry lifts the one-form singlet constraint in the gauge theory, as before. The K → ∞ limit does not appear particularly interesting on either side of the duality. Parafermions with K → ∞ are indistinguishable from bosons at states with low parafermion num- bers, as ω → 1. In other words, they are like compact scalars φ for all states with much less than K bosons. Similarly, the amount of ﬂux attachment goes to zero in the dual theory, meaning that it will look like a regular U(1) gauge theory in states with low excitations. It would be interesting 38 to understand whether the regime of highly excited states in these theories becomes more tractable at K → ∞ than at ﬁnite N . A more interesting question concerns ZK theories with q units of ﬂux attachment when q ̸= ±1 mod K. These have Gauss operators ̃G∨ f ≡ G∨ f ∏ v: v0=f (W ∨ v )q. (116) The gauge-invariant operators here are W ∨ v and ̃Π∨ ℓ = Π∨ ℓ (Φ∨ c(ℓ))q. What are their parafermion duals? There are two cases to inspect. If q does not divide K, the entire gauge-invariant algebra can be generated by ̃Π∨ ℓ and (W ∨ v )q. Their commutation relations are just like the ones in eq. (111), except with the substitution ω ↦→ ωq. Thus the dual of this theory is a set of parafermions with “fractional statistics,” i.e. with factors of ωq = e2πiq/K instead of ω appearing in commutation relations (72), and with ηℓΣℓ = ̃Π∨ ℓ , Πv = (W ∨ v )q. (117) It is therefore possible to ﬁnd a bosonic dual to any theory with statistics governed by a rational number q/K (the q/K parafermions). Thus the set of all ﬂux-attached theories is mapped by duality to the set of all possible Abelian anyons. If K = qr for r ∈ Z, (W ∨ v )q and ̃Π∨ ℓ satisfy the algebra of Zr parafermion bilinears, and indeed the dual theory is that of Zr parafermions coupled to Zq scalar twist ﬁelds. To see this, ﬁrst note that the gauge theory target space can be understood as the orbifold ZK/Zq: this is a ﬂux-attached Zr gauge theory coupled to “twist ﬁelds” that change from one of the q copies of Zr to the next one when the electric ﬁeld Πℓ tries to shift the ﬁeld at ℓ from |ωnr−1⟩ to |ωnr⟩. Thus the ZK theory decomposes into a ﬂux-attached Zr theory and an ordinary Zq gauge theory, with ̃Π∨ ℓ understood as a product of the ﬂux-attached electric operator for Zr ﬁelds and an ordinary electric operator for Zq ﬁelds that activates only when the Zr ﬁeld is a chosen state, say |ωr−1⟩, on the given link. Each of these can be dualized independently, giving a theory of Zr parafermions coupled to scalar Zq twist ﬁelds. In summary: ZK parafermions/ZK = ﬂux-attached ZK gauge theory∨/(ZK one-form), q K parafermions/ZK = q-ﬂux-attached ZK gauge theory∨/(ZK one-form). (118) 39 4.3 Comments on paraspin structures Recall that the discussion of spin structures in subsection 3.3 was initiated as the discussion of twist ﬁelds. It is thus natural to identify the twists of parafermion dualities with paraspin structures on the lattice M. These are topological ZK ﬁelds whose curvature is ﬁxed locally but whose holonomies can be dynamical. If the holonomies are merely background ﬁelds, the theory can be called a paraspin theory, in analogy with the Z2 case. If the holonomies are dynamical, the theory is a non-paraspin theory. Unlike the Z2 case, however, here there is no notion of a ZK Stiefel-Whitney class, and one may wonder how natural is it to even deﬁne paraspin structures. A conjectural answer to this question is that paraspin structures may naturally appear only in low dimensions. Recall that the universal cover of SO(2), the Euclidean rotation group in D = 2, is R. Thus deﬁning Spin(2) such that SO(2) = Spin(2)/Z2 appears unnatural; one could easily deﬁne SpinK(2) as the K-fold cover of SO(2) such that SO(2) = SpinK(2)/ZK. Similarly, in D = 3 the representations used to classify massive particles are governed by the little group SO(2), which can be uplifted to any SpinK(2). This matches well with the lore that parafermions are sensible quantum degrees of freedom in d = 1, while they may appear as massive excitations (Abelian anyons) in topological theories in d = 2. It would be interesting to develop a discrete theory of paraspin structures and ZK Stiefel-Whitney classes, and to see in these discrete setups why such objects might be unnatural in higher dimensions. Steps in this direction have been taken in [41–43]. 5 Conclusion This paper has collected and derived a large number of exact dualities in d = 1 and d = 2. Some higher dimensional dualities have also been shown. Most of the dualities here are not new, with the notable exception of dualities with fractional statistics in subsection 4.2. Moreover, these are certainly not all the exact dualities in low dimensions. Nevertheless, the analysis in this paper may prove to be a useful step towards systematizing our knowledge of dualities in general. Immediate generalizations to be explored involve writing explicit dualities in higher dimensions, understanding the details of what goes wrong when the Stiefel-Whitney class w2 is not exact, and extending this story to include spinc structures. A longer-term generalization that is also intriguing is the extension of the discussion presented here to any class of nonabelian lattice theories. Two rather ambitious problems remain open. One concerns explicit discretizations of Chern- Simons theory. The ﬂux-attached gauge theories of subsections 3.2 and 4.2 have Gauss laws, line operators (anyon statistics), and framing dependence that bring to mind Chern-Simons theories. 40 It is easy to come up with particular Hamiltonians for such theories which break time-reversal symmetry and are described by topological ﬁeld theories at long distances. Unfortunately, in the simplest models the ground state degeneracies of these theories do not match the Chern-Simons ones, and there are no protected edge modes. These issues do not appear unsurmountable. By further projecting to a part of the Hilbert space, the ground state degeneracy for a Z2 ﬂux-attached gauge theory on a lattice of genus g can be brought down from 22g to 2g (though whether this is physically interesting remains to be seen). Moreover, by making sure to give the massive excitations a nontrivial band structure (say, by taking the particular Z2 gauge theory to be dual to a fermionic Chern insulator of some sort), a protected edge spectrum and quantum Hall behavior may be obtained. Understanding the details of such constructions is a task for the (hopefully near) future. The second problem of interest is the quest for a spin-statistics relation in discrete setups.25 Subsection 3.3 has emphasized that spin structures can indeed naturally appear without the crutch of relativity. These spin structures are crucial ingredients in deﬁning JW dualities, and the corre- sponding paraspin structures are equally important for FK dualities. These dualities, in turn, are the most direct ways to deﬁne what one means by a (para)fermionic Hilbert space, as commented below eq. (12). This is because any many-body system with nontrivial statistics must generically be given a graded Hilbert space, which depends on a choice of ordering of creation operators. By bosonizing these systems, all these ordering ambiguities are transferred into a choice of twisting. (This still does not uniquely ﬁx the bosonic system, cf. footnote 14, but the remaining choices on the bosonic side do not inﬂuence ordering ambiguities.) By promoting the twists into dynamical variables, these ambiguities are eﬀectively averaged over, resulting in a theory whose Hilbert space can be constructed without obstructions. The general question that remains is this: is it possible to prove that any deﬁnition of a (para)fermionic Hilbert space — even without using duality — necessitates the introduction of a (para)spin structure?
