{"path":"vgla assessed week 4.pdf","text":"vgla assessed week 4 For all of the below , we use that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the diagonals. det(A) = n ∏ i=1 aii A is a (upper) triangular matrix as below the aii values they are all 0: det A = 1 ⋅ 1 ⋅ 1 ⋅ 1 = 1 We will use EROs to assume B into the form of an triangular matrix, and the fact that adding or subtracting to another row or column with an existing row or column does not change the determinant. W e subtract row 2 by 1, 4 times. det B = det = 1 ⋅ −7 ⋅ 1 ⋅ 1 = −7 For C we will use the ERO of swapping rows, or columns and the resulting ef fect that causes the determinant to become negative of the original determinant. It is then given, by swapping row 1 with 2: 1. Let n ≥ 2 be an integer . Consider the permutation σ : {1, 2, . . . , n} → {1, 2, . . . , n} defined by σ(i) = { σ : {2, 3, 4 … n − 1, n, 1} N(σ) = n − 1 σ(i) = { i + 1 if i < n, 1 if i = n. (a) Write down $σ$ in the sequence notation, $σ = [σ(1), σ(2), . . . , σ(n)]$ (b) Find $N (σ)$, the number of inversions in $σ$. (c) Find $σ^{-1}$, the inverse of $σ$ i − 1 if i < n, n if i = 1. 2. Find the determinants of the following matrices. You may use any general results about determinants, as long as you clearly state them. Giving the correct answer without showing a correct justification will get you no marks. ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 1 2 3 4 0 −7 −10 −13 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ Semester_2_Sheet_2_qs.pdf det C = − det = −8 For D we will use both swapping and adding, and subtracting existing rows to the form of a triangular matrix. We swap row 1 and 2, and then the new row 2 and 3. Then we add the new row 3 to row 4. As we have swapped twice the −12 which cancels out on the determinant det D = det = 24 For E we will the following: Let B be some matrix and C be B with a swap, and use use the result that the determinant of a matrix that has had a row or column swapped, which is given by: det B = − det C Let k ∈ N be the number of swaps that C has undergone. It then follows that for k swaps: det B = (−1)k det C If n = 2m (even), then it takes m swaps of columns or rows to obtain a triangular matrix, if m is even ( n is a multiple of 4), then the negative for each switch cancels out and the determinant is simply: ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 4 1 2 3 0 2 3 4 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 4 1 2 3 0 2 3 4 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ det(AB) = det A det B Applying a scalar λ on a matrix is the same as multiplying every row or column by λ which's effect is to increase the determinant by λ for each row/column multiplied so the overall ef fect increases the determinant by λn where n is the size of the n × n square matrix. det A = det AT The inverse is given by det(D ⋅ D−1) = det D ⋅ det D−1 = det I = 1 ⟹ det D−1 = 1 det D det E = det ( 1 2 AT ⋅ B ⋅ C 2 ⋅ D−1) = det 1 2 AT ⋅ det B ⋅ det C 2 ⋅ det D−1 = 1 2 4 ⋅ det A ⋅ det B ⋅ det C ⋅ det C ⋅ 1 det D = 1 16 ⋅ 1 ⋅ −7 ⋅ −82 ⋅ 1 24 = − 7 6 3. Let n ∈ N and ai ∈ R for i = 1, 2, … , n.

Following by the same reasoning as the even case (n = 2m) we see if m is even then det A = n ∏ i=1 ai(n−i+1) Else odd: det A = − n ∏ i=1 ai(n−i+1) We may then generalise this as: det A = (−1)⌊ n 2 ⌋ n ∏ i=1 ai(n−i+1) 4. For every integer n ≥ 2, let An = be the n×n matrix where every element on the main diagonal, every element just above the main diagonal, and every element just below the main diagonal, is 1, while every other element is 0. An equivalent description of An is that the 1st row has 1 in the first and second columns, the nth row has 1 in the (n − 1)th and nth columns, and the ith row for i = 2, 3, . . . , n − 1 has 1 in the (i − 1)th, ith and (i + 1)th columns, while every other element is 0. .
