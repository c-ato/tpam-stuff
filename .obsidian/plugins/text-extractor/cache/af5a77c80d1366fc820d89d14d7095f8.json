Four-vectors In this lecture we reconsider Lorentz transformations by treating them by analogy to rotations in the plane which we mentioned in the beginning of this course. The main points we will concentrate on are: 1. A combination of two consecutive Lorentz transformation with velocities v1 and v2 is an- other Lorentz transformation with velocity v3 calculated in accordance with relativistic velocity composition law. 2. Time and space intervals are transforming accordingly to Lorentz transformation when considered in diﬀerent reference frames. Are there other quantities which transform in this way? We shall see that energy and momentum provide such an example. To simplify the calculations we use units in which c = 1. This means velocities are measured in units of speed of light 1 and distances have the same units as time. Lorentz transformation to the frame moving with velocity v becomes t′ = t √1 − v2 − vx √1 − v2 = at − bx x ′ = − vt √1 − v2 + x √1 − v2 = −bt + ax , where a = γ(v) = 1/√1 − v2, b = v/ √ 1 − v2. It is easy to see that coeﬃcients a and b are related by a2 − b2 = 1. This suggests that they can be written as a = cosh θ, b = sinh θ using one single parameter θ such that tanh θ = sinh θ cosh θ = b a = v . Lorentz transformation in the form t′ = cosh θ t − sinh θ x x′ = − sinh θ t + cosh θ x should be compared with the transformation x′ = cos α x + sin α y y′ = − sin α x + cos α y . of xy plane rotated by angle α. The coeﬃcients cos α, sin α satisfy Pythagoras theorem cos2 α + sin2 α = 1 and the transformation preserves the circles x2 + y2 = R2 = x′2 + y′2. Lorentz transformations, on the contrary, preserve hyperbolas t2 − x2 = s2 = t′2 − x′2 (invariance of relativistic interval) and are sometimes described as “hyperbolic rotations”. We now want to combine two Lorentz transformation t′ = cosh θ t − sinh θ x x′ = − sinh θ t + cosh θ x 1For example a 60 mph speed limit will look (approximately) like 10−7. DM Gangardt 1 University of Birmingham SR Lecture 10 Lorentz Transformations of energy and momentum and t ′′ = cosh φ t ′ − sinh φ x ′ x ′′ = − sinh φ t ′ + cosh φ x ′ by substituting t′, x′ from the ﬁrst one, t ′′ = cosh φ (cosh θ t − sinh θ x) − sinh φ (− sinh θ t + cosh θ x) x ′′ = − sinh φ (cosh θ t − sinh θ x) + cosh φ (− sinh θ t + cosh θ x) Using hyperbolic function properties sinh(θ + φ) = sinh θ cosh φ + cosh θ sinh φ, and cosh(θ + φ) = cosh θ cosh φ + sinh θ sinh φ one arrives at t ′′ = cosh(θ + φ)t − sinh(θ + φ)x x′′ = − sinh(θ + φ)t + cosh(θ + φ)x , which shows that a combination of Lorentz transformations with parameters θ and φ is againa Lorentz transformation with parameter θ + φ. The velocity corresponding to this transformation is obtained from u = tanh(θ + φ) = tanh θ + tanh φ 1 + tanh θ tanh φ Using tanh θ = v and tanh φ = w we recognise the relativistic velocity composition, u = v + w 1 + vw , or, reintroducing the speed of light v → u/c, w → w/c, u → u/c, u = v + w 1 + vw/c2 , Using the parametrisation v = tanh θ we can write the relativistic momentum and energy of a particle with mass m as p′ = mv √1 − v2 = m sinh θ E′ = m √1 − v2 = m cosh θ (The primed notations are used as we consider this frame moving) Now we consider the same particle in the inertial frame which moves with velocity −w = − tanh φ and which we consider stationary. In this frame the particle has velocity u = (v + w)/(1 + vw) = tanh(θ + φ). The momentum p and energy E in this frame are p = mu √1 − u2 = m sinh(θ + φ) = m sinh θ cosh φ + m cosh θ sinh φ E = u √1 − u2 = m cosh(θ + φ) = m cosh θ cosh φ + m sinh θ sinh φ DM Gangardt 2 University of Birmingham SR Lecture 10 Lorentz Transformations of energy and momentum This is nothing but a Lorentz transformation p = cosh φ p ′ + sinh φ E′ = p′ + (w/c2)E′ √ 1 − w2/c2 E = cosh φ E′ + sinh φ p ′ = E′ + w′p √ 1 − w2/c2 . In the last equation we have reintroduced the speed of light for clarity. Let us recall that in the full four-dimensional time-space with p = px, the transverse components py, pz are not aﬀected by Lorentz transformation to a frame moving in x-direction. We see that four quantities (E/c, px, py, pz) transform exactly in the same way as (ct, x, y, z). The quantities which are transformed this way are called four-vectors and are denoted as (a0, a1, a2, a3) using their four components aµ with Greek index µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
