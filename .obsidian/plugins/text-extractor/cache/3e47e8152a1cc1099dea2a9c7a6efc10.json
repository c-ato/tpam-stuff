The noise on the data is known to be drawn from a normal distirbution and the uncertainty on each data point is given.= [5.52, 3.73, 5.24, 4.20] D = [23.6, 18.6, 21.9, 20.9] σD = [1.0, 1.2, 2.6, 1.4] Marks will be awarded in the following way: i) State the likelihood function you are using (log likelihood is ine) [1 mark] ii) Calculate the best-it estimates, ˆm and ˆc and show your working [3 marks] iii) Calculate the uncertainty on these estimates, σ ˆm and σˆc [1 mark] iv) Estimate the covariance of the best it parameters, Cov( ˆm, ˆc). [1 mark] v) Make a plot (hand drawn or computer generated is ine) of the data, together with the best-it model [2 marks] vi) Make a prediction, including uncertainty in ˆm and ˆc, on the value of the model at the exact value x = 2. (Hint: use the variance formula including accounting for covariance) [2 marks] [ ]: 1 Special Relativity Assessed problem 3 A pion has rest mass 139.58MeV and a mean-lifetime of 2.5 × 10 −8 s whereas a muon has rest mass 105.65MeV and a mean-lifetime of 2.2 × 10−6 s. A pion usually decays into a muon and a neutrino. You may assume that a neutrino is massless and lives forever. Assuming that the pion is initially at rest, ﬁnd the velocity of the muon and the mean-distance that the muons travel in the pion rest-frame.
