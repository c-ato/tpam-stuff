{"path":"Year 1/Summative Assessed Problem/Problem sheet/Mechsheet4qn.pdf","text":"1Mech — Mechanics Mechanics exercises 4 (weeks 8 and 9) This sheet’s assessed questions are question 2 and 3. If you are taking this module at level I (typically if you are a year 2 student) then you must also do the final part of question 3. 1. If we throw a particle of mass m upwards from the top of a wall of height h with velocity v, how high will it go and what will its velocity be when it hits the ground? 2. Assessed Let a particle of mass m be attached to two springs, both with spring constant k. The end of one spring (denoted α, with natural length a) is attached at a point A, with the end of the other spring (denoted β, with natural length 2a) attached at a point B, a distance 4a directly above A. The mass is attached to the free end of both springs. The particle is at a location x(t), where x is measured upwards such that x = 0 at point A. (a) Show that i. the extension in spring α is given by x − a. ii. the extension in spring β is given by 2a − x. (b) Hence write down the equation for conservation of energy. (c) If the particle is initially at rest at x = 2a, find the value of the constant energy. (d) Find the height at which the particle will next come to rest. 3. Assessed A smooth (i.e. no friction) wire is in the shape of a helix so that x = a cos θ (t), y = a sin θ (t), z = aθ (t) /2, with the central (z) axis pointing vertically upwards. A small bead of mass m moves along the wire, starting from height z = 2πa with speed 0. (a) By writing down the position vector and differentiating, show that ˙r = −a ˙θ sin θi + a ˙θ cos θj + a 2 ˙θk, and hence that the kinetic energy of the bead is given by 5ma2 8 ˙θ2. (b) Write down the potential energy of the bead in terms of θ, choosing the po- tential to be zero at z = 0. (c) Hence show that conservation of energy gives 5ma 2 8 ˙θ2 + mga 2 θ = 2mgπa. (d) By rearranging to find an equation for ˙θ2, find the maximum value that θ can attain. What does this mean physically? (e) Extension for Level I only: We will now calculate how long will it take for the bead to reach z = 0. 1 i. By square rooting, find an expression for ˙θ. Ensure that you take the correct sign! ii. By separating the variables in your expression and integrating both sides between t = 0 and t = T (where T is the time at which the bead reaches z = 0), find how long it will take to reach z = 0. 4. A comet (mass m) which is travelling with speed V , approaches a stationary planet from a great distance. If the path of the comet was not affected by the planet, the distance of closest approach would be p. The comet experiences an attractive force GM m/r2 towards the planet where r is the distance between them, G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the planet. (a) Briefly explain why r2 ˙θ = constant, 1 2 m ( ˙r2 + r2 ˙θ2) − GM m r = constant. (b) Using the initial conditions, find the values of the constants in part (a). (c) By eliminating ˙θ, show that ˙r2 = V 2 + 2GM r − p2V 2 r2 . (d) Hence calculate the actual distance of closest approach. 2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
