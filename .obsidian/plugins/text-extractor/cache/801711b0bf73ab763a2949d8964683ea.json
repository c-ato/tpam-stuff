A forced damped pendulum has an equation d2θ The error stems from sin θ = θ − θ3 using the two identities y2 − x2 = (y − x)(y + x) y3 − x3 = (y − x)(y2 + xy + x2) We may also product the two equations to get xy [ (r(1 − x)(1 − y)) 2 − 1] = 0 If we are hunting for 2-cycles we may assume x ̸= y and xy ̸= 0 because x=0 is a 1-cycle. We can then observe that we are left with (1 − x)(1 − y) = 1 − (y + x) + xy = σ from which we can create the quadratic equations and stability is controlled by S = −r2 1 We now need the identity e 3iφ = cos 3φ + i sin 3φ = (cos φ + i sin φ)3 = cos3 φ − 3 cos φ sin2 φ + i(3 cos 2 φ sin φ − sin3 φ) which gives us that sin 3φ = 3 sin φ − 4 sin 3 φ and when r=9 we ﬁnd [ sin πyn+1 with z= 3πy x = 0.222.... ⇒ 3x = 2.222.... = 2 + x ⇒ x = 1 For 2-cycles we can use numbers that repeat by two digits if there are an even number of ones but repeat with their complements if there is an odd number of ones 0.0000..., 0.0202..., 0.2020..., 0.2222..., 0.1111..., 0.0121..., 0.2101..., 0.1012..., 0.1210... provide the nine possibilities. We can see the three 1-cycles and then applying the map we get the pairs x = 0.0202... y = 0.2020... ⇒ 3x = y 3y = 2 + x = 9x ⇒ x = 1 The energies of the individual components are conserved so E = E1 + E2 E1 = p 2 1 Find the ﬁxed points and determine the local trajectories in the vicinity of these ﬁxed points. [7] Depict the phase space portrait. [3] Answer 6. First we need to ﬁnd the ﬁxed points f1[x1, x2] ≡ −x1 + x2 f2[x1, x2] ≡ −x1 − x2 + 4x1x2 + 2x2 1 − 2x3 1 − 2x3 2 and so f1[x1, x2]=0 and f2[x1, x2]=0 lead to x1 = x2 − 2x1 + 6x2 1 − 4x3 1 ⇒ x1 = x2 = 0, 1 [ 1 ∓ √2 1 1 −1 ∓ √2 ] [ α± β± ] = [ 0 0 ] ⇒ [ α± β± ] = [ 1 ± √2 − 1 ] or [ 1 ± √2 1 ] and so [ δx1 δx2 ] = Ae −2t+ √2t [ 1 + √2 1 ] + Be −2t− √2t [ 1 −1 − √2 ] and we have a stable ﬁxed point. The trajectories move fast towards the origin along the line x2 = −(√2 + 1)x1 and move more slowly towards the origin along the line x2 = (√2 − 1)x1. 10","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
