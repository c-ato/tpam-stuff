{"path":"Formative Problems/Solutions/Vectors-1.pdf","text":"VGLA: Vectors Practice Questions The following questions relate to Chapter 1, Vectors. Questions are ranked in diﬃculty from A (basic) to C (challenging). (A) Question 1. For each of the following sets of points U , V and W calculate ⃗U V , ⃗U W and hence determine whether U , V and W are co-linear: (a) U = (1, 3, −1), V = (5, 1, −2) and W = (3, 2, −3); (b) U = (2, 1, 4), V = (1, 4, 2) and W = (4, −5, 8). Solution: (a) ⃗U V = v − u = (5, 1, −2) − (1, 3, −1) = (4, −2, −1) = 4i − 2j − k. ⃗U W = (2, −1, −2) = 2i − j − 2k. Since ⃗U V ̸= α ⃗U W for any α ∈ R, we conclude that U , V and W are not co-linear. (b) ⃗U V = (−1, 3, −2) = −i + 3j − 2k. ⃗U W = (2, −6, 4) = 2i − 6j + 4k. Since ⃗U W = −2 ⃗U V , we conclude that U , V and W are co-linear. ■ (A) Question 2. In each of the following cases, ﬁnd numbers s and t, if they exist, such that w = su+tv: (a) u = (3, −1, 1), v = (4, 3, −3) and w = (17, 3, −3); (b) u = (2, −3, 5), v = (−1, 4, 6) and w = (8, −17, 2). (If w = su + tv, w is said to be a linear combination of u and v.) Solution: (a) Observe that w = su + tv ⇐⇒ (17, 3, −3) = s(3, −1, 1) + t(4, 3, −3) ⇐⇒ (17, 3, −3) = (3s + 4t, −s + 3t, s − 3t) ⇐⇒    3s + 4t = 17 −s + 3t = 3 s − 3t = −3 ⇐⇒ { 3s + 4t = 17 −s + 3t = 3 ⇐⇒ s = 3, t = 2. Hence, w = 3u + 2t. Note that you can check this answer directly by substitution of s and t into w = su + tv. (b) w = su + tv ⇐⇒ (8, −17, 2) = s(2, −3, 5) + t(−1, 4, 6) ⇐⇒ (8, −17, 2) = (2s − t, −3s + 4t, 5s + 6t) 1 ⇐⇒    2s − t = 8 −3s + 4t = −17 5s + 6t = 2 ⇐⇒    2s − t = 8 5s = 15 5s + 6t = 2 ⇐⇒    s = 3 t = −2 5(3) + 6(−2) = 3 ̸= 2 and hence, there does not exist s, t ∈ R such that w = su + tv. Note that the set of all linear combinations of 2 vectors u and v in E3 (i.e. su + tv for s, t ∈ R) deﬁnes a plane. If a point is not on that plane, then it cannot be represented by a linear combination of u and v. ■ (A) Question 3. Find the vector u which has magnitude 6 and has the same direction as the vector v = (1, −2, 1). Solution: The vector u must satisfy u = λv and |u| = 6 for some λ ∈ R+. Thus, |u| = √(λ)2 + (−2λ)2 + (λ)2 = √6λ ⇐⇒ λ = √6. We conclude that the vector u is given by u = √6v = (√6, −2√6, √6 ) . ■ (A) Question 4. In each of the following cases, ﬁnd the unit vector with the same direction as v and the unit vector with the opposite direction to v: (a) v = (3, −2, −6); (b) v = (0, −3, 5). Solution: (a) |v| = √(3)2 + (−2)2 + (−6)2 = √49 = 7 and hence the unit vector in the same direction as v is given by ev = 1 7 v = ( 3 7 , − 2 7 , − 6 7 ) . Moreover, the unit vector in the opposite direction to v is given by e−v = − 1 7 v = (− 3 7 , 2 7 , 6 7 ) . (b) |v| = √(0)2 + (−3)2 + (5)2 = √34 and hence the unit vector in the same direction as v is given by ev = 1 √34 v = (0, − 3 √34 , 5 √34 ) . Moreover, the unit vector in the opposite direction to v is given by e−v = − 1 √34 v = (0, 3 √34 , − 5 √34 ) . ■ (A) Question 5. For each of the following pairs of vectors u and v, determine whether they are perpendicular: (a) u = (2, −3, 1) and v = (5, 4, 2); 2 (b) u = (cos θ, sin θ, 1) and v = (sin θ, − cos θ, 1); (c) u = (cos θ, sin θ, 1) and v = (cos θ, sin θ, −1). Solution: (a) Since u and v are non-zero vectors and u.v = (2, −3, 1).(5, 4, 2) = 2.5+(−3).4+1.2 = 10−12+2 = 0, it follows that u ⊥ v. (b) Since u and v are non-zero vectors and u.v = (cos θ, sin θ, 1).(sin θ, − cos θ, 1) = cos θ. sin θ − sin θ. cos θ + 1 = 1 ̸= 0 for all θ ∈ [0, 2π), it follows that for all θ ∈ [0, 2π) we have u ̸⊥ v. (c) Since u and v are non-zero vectors and u.v = (cos θ, sin θ, 1).(cos θ, sin θ, −1) = cos2 θ + sin2 θ − 1 = 0 for all θ ∈ [0, 2π), it follows that for all θ ∈ [0, 2π), we have u ⊥ v. ■ (A) Question 6. Find all values of λ, if any, for which the vectors u and v are perpendicular: (a) u = (3, −2, 1) and v = (4, λ, −2); (b) u = (λ, 2, 7) and v = (λ, −3, 1); (c) u = (1, λ, λ) and v = (−2, λ, 1). Solution: Since none of the vectors above are the zero vector, it follows that u ⊥ v ⇐⇒ u.v = 0. Hence: (a) u ⊥ v ⇐⇒ (3, −2, 1).(4, λ, −2) = 0 ⇐⇒ 12 − 2λ − 2 = 0 ⇐⇒ λ = 5. So λ ∈ {5}. (b) u ⊥ v ⇐⇒ (λ, 2, 7).(λ, −3, 1) ⇐⇒ λ2 − 6 + 7 = 0 ⇐⇒ λ 2 + 1 = 0. Since the quadratic equation has no real solutions, it follows that u ̸⊥ v for all λ ∈ R. (c) u ⊥ v ⇐⇒ (1, λ, λ).(−2, λ, 1) ⇐⇒ −2+λ2+λ = 0 ⇐⇒ (λ+2)(λ−1) = 0 ⇐⇒ λ = −2 or λ = 1. So λ ∈ {1, −2}. ■ (A) Question 7. If u = (2, 3, −1), v = (−2, −1, 2) and w = (1, 2, 1), calculate: (a) u × v; (b) (u × v) × w; (c) v × w; (d) u × (v × w); (e) u.(v × w). (f) Deduce from (a), the two unit vectors that are perpendicular to both u and v. Solution: (a) u × v = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 2 3 −1 −2 −1 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ((3)(2) − (−1)(−1))i − ((2)(2) − (−1)(−2))j + ((2)(−1) − (3)(−2))k = (5, −2, 4). An incomplete check that your calculations are correct involves computing u.(u × v) and v.(u × v), and checking that they equal 0. This does not check the right hand rule is satisﬁed though. For the remaining parts of the question, we just give the answer. 3 (b) (u × v) × w = (−10, −1, 12). (c) v × w = (−5, 4, −3). (d) u × (v × w) = (−5, 11, 23); (e) u.(v × w) = (2, 3, −1).(−5, 4, −3) = −10 + 12 + 3 = 5. (f) Since (u × v) ⊥ u and (u × v) ⊥ v it follows that the two unit vectors that are perpendicular to both u and v are given by ±1 |u × v| (u × v) = ±1 √ 52 + (−2)2 + 42 (5, −2, 4) = ± ( 5 √45 , − 2 √45 , 4 √45 ) . ■ (A) Question 8. In each of the following cases, ﬁnd an equation for the plane π: (a) π is parallel to the yz-plane and intersects the point (1, 2, 3); (b) π is parallel to the zx-plane and intersects the point (3, −1, 4); (c) π intersects the point (2, −1, −4) and has normal vector (2, 1, 0); (d) π intersects the points U = (1, 1, 3), V = (−1, 3, 2) and W = (1, −2, 5). Solution: (a) x = 1. (b) y = −1. (c) If the plane intersects (2, −1, −4) and has normal vector n = (2, 1, 0) then the equation of the plane is given by ((x, y, z) − (2, −1, −4)).(2, 1, 0) = 0 ⇐⇒ 2x + y = 3. (d) A normal vector to the plane Π can be found by ⃗U V × ⃗U W i.e. n = ⃗U V × ⃗U W = (−2, 2, −1) × (0, −3, 2) = (1, 4, 6). Therefore, the equation of the plane Π is given by ((x, y, z) − (1, 1, 3)).(1, 4, 6) = 0 ⇐⇒ x + 4y + 6z = 23. ■ (A) Question 9. Obtain a set of parametric equations for the straight line L that intersects the points P = (3, 1, 4) and Q = (−1, −2, 8). Find the coordinates of the points of intersection of L and the plane π in part (A) Question 8, part (d). Solution: The direction of the line L is ⃗P Q = (−4, −3, 4). Thus, the set of parametric equations for the line L is    x = 3 − 4λ y = 1 − 3λ z = 4 + 4λ. The point(s) of intersection between the line L and the plane Π (if they exist) can be determined by substitution of the parametric equations for the line, into the Cartesian equation for the plane i.e. (3 − 4λ) + 4(1 − 3λ) + 6(4 + 4λ) = 23 ⇐⇒ 8λ = 23 − 31 ⇐⇒ λ = −1. Therefore the point of intersection has co-ordinates    x = 3 − 4(−1) = 7 y = 1 − 3(−1) = 4 z = 4 + 4(−1) = 0 ■ 4 (A) Question 10. In each of the following cases, ﬁnd the volume of the parallelepiped with vectors u, v and w as adjacent edges: (a) u = (0, 2, 2), v = (3, 1, 1) and w = (3, −5, 1); (b) u = (1, 0, 2), v = (1, 1, 0) and w = (0, 1, 1). Solution: The volume V of the parallelepiped deﬁned above is given by |u.(v × w)|. (a) Since v × w = (6, 0, −18), it follows that V = |(0, 2, 2).(6, 0, −18)| = 36. (b) Since v × w = (1, −1, 1), it follows that V = |(1, 0, 2).(1, −1, 1)| = 3. ■ (A) Question 11. For the vectors u = (1, −1, 0), v = (0, 1, 1) and w = (2, 0, −1) calculate: (a) u × v; (b) (u × v) × w; (c) u.w; (d) v.w. Verify directly for vectors u, v and w that (u × v) × w = (u.w)v − (v.w)u. Solution: (a) u × v = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 1 −1 0 0 1 1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ((−1)(1) − (0)(1))i − ((1)(1) − (0)(0))j + ((1)(1) − (−1)(0))k = (−1, −1, 1). (b) (u × v) × w = (−1, −1, 1) × (2, 0, −1) = (1, 1, 2). (c) u.w = (1, −1, 0).(2, 0, −1) = 2. (d) v.w = (0, 1, 1).(2, 0, −1) = −1. Finally, since (u.w)v − (v.w)u = 2(0, 1, 1) − (−1)(1, −1, 0) = (1, 1, 2), it follows from (b) that for the vectors u, v and w the following identity holds: (u × v) × w = (u.w)v − (v.w)u. ■ (A) Question 12. For the vectors a = (3, 0, 0) and b = (1, −2, 2), ﬁnd the following: (a) |a| and |b|; (b) a · b; (c) unit vectors parallel to b in the same/opposite direction; (d) the projection of the vector a unto the direction of vector b, i.e. projb(a); (e) the vectors u and w such that a = u + w with u ∥ b and u ⊥ w. Solution: (a) |a| = 3 and |b| = √1 + 4 + 4 = 3. 5 (b) a · b = 3.1 + 0 + 0 = 3. (c) Since |b| = 3 it follows that eb = ( 1 3 , − 2 3 , 2 3 ) and e-b = (− 1 3 , 2 3 , − 2 3 ) . (d) projb(a) = (a.eb) eb = ( (3, 0, 0). ( 1 3 , − 2 3 , 2 3 )) ( 1 3 , − 2 3 , 2 3 ) = ( 1 3 , − 2 3 , 2 3 ) . (e) It follows that u = projb(a) and w = a − u i.e. u = ( 1 3 , − 2 3 , 2 3 ) and w = (3, 0, 0) − ( 1 3 , − 2 3 , 2 3 ) = ( 8 3 , 2 3 , − 2 3 ) . ■ (A) Question 13. Consider the vectors a = (3, −2, 0) and b = (1, −2, 2), and the points P (1, −1, 2), Q(1, 0, 0) and R(−3, 0, 1). (a) Determine a × b; (b) Find two distinct unit vectors perpendicular to the plane containing the vectors a and b; (c) Find an equation of the plane Π1 that intersects the point P and is perpendicular to the vector b; (d) Find an equation of the plane Π2 parallel to the plane Π1 that intersects the origin; (e) Find an equation of the plane Π3 that intersects the points P , Q and R; (f) Find an equation of the line L1 that intersects the point A with position vector a and is parallel to the vector b; (g) Find an equation of the plane Π4 which contains the line L1 and the point P ; (h) Find the point of intersection of the line L1 and the plane Π5 with equation 2x − 3y + z = −3. Solution: (a) a × b = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 3 −2 0 1 −2 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = −4i − 6j − 4k. (b) Since |a × b| = √ (−4)2 + (−6)2 + (−4)2 = √68, it follows that the two unit vectors perpendicular to the plane are e± = ± ( 4 √68 , 6 √68 , 4 √68 ) . (c) Since b is a normal vector to Π1, it follows that the plane Π1 is given by the equation (x, y, z).(1, −2, 2) = (1, −1, 2).(1, −2, 2) ⇐⇒ x − 2y + 2z = 7. (d) Via (c), the plane Π2 has equation x − 2y + 2z = 0. (e) Since ⃗P Q × ⃗P R = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 0 1 −2 −4 1 −1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = i + 8j + 4k, and Q ∈ Π3, it follows that the plane Π3 is given by (x, y, z).(1, 8, 4) = (1, 0, 0).(1, 8, 4) ⇐⇒ x + 8y + 4z = 1. 6 (f) The line L1 is given by r(t) = a + tb = (3 + t, −2 − 2t, 2t) for t ∈ R. (g) Since ⃗AP × ⃗OB = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k −2 1 2 1 −2 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = 6i + 6j + 3k, and A ∈ Π4, it follows that the plane Π4 is given by (x, y, z).(6, 6, 3) = (3, −2, 0).(6, 6, 3) ⇐⇒ 6x + 6y + 3z = 6. (h) Substituting the parametric equations for L1 into Π5 gives 2(3 + t) − 3(−2 − 2t) + (2t) = −3 ⇐⇒ 10t = −15 ⇐⇒ t = − 3 2 , and hence the point of intersection of L1 and Π5 is ( 3 2 , 1, −3). ■ (B) Question 14. The mid-points of the sides AB, BC, CD and DA of a quadrilateral ABCD are E, F , G and H respectively. Show, using vectors, that EF GH is a parallelogram. Hint: Take position vectors relative to an origin O and use the result that a quadrilateral with a pair of opposite sides which are parallel and equal in length is a parallelogram. Solution: A sketch of terms in the question. It follows that ⃗AB + ⃗BC + ⃗CD + ⃗DA = 0, (1) ⃗EF + ⃗F G + ⃗GH + ⃗HE = 0, (2) ⃗EF = 1 2 ( ⃗AB + ⃗BC), ⃗F G = 1 2 ( ⃗BC + ⃗CD), ⃗GH = 1 2 ( ⃗CD + ⃗DA) and ⃗HE = 1 2 ( ⃗DA + ⃗AB). (3) Substituting expressions for ⃗EF and ⃗GH into (2) gives 1 2 ( ⃗AB + ⃗BC) + ⃗F G + 1 2 ( ⃗CD + ⃗DA) + ⃗HE = 0 1 2 ( ⃗AB + ⃗BC + ⃗CD + ⃗DA) + ⃗F G + ⃗HE = 0 (+ is associative/commutative) ⃗F G = ⃗EH (via (1)). (4) Substituting (4) into (2) then gives ⃗EF + ⃗GH + ( ⃗F G − ⃗EH) = 0 =⇒ ⃗EF = ⃗HG. (5) It follow from (4) and (5) that EFGH is a parallelogram, as required. ■ 7 (B) Question 15. Let u and v be the distinct position vectors relative to an origin O of the points U and V respectively. Additionally, let W be a point on either U V (outside the closed line segment [UV]) or V U (outside the closed line segment [VU]) such that U W : W V = s : t. Establish that the position vector w of W relative to O is given by w = ( s s − t ) v − ( t s − t ) u. If U = (2, −4, 3) and V = (−3, 1, −2), ﬁnd the coordinates of W when (a) W is on V U and U W : W V = 2 : 7; (b) W is on U V and U W : W V = 7 : 2. Solution: A sketch of terms in the question. Let w be the position vector of W relative to O. Then w = u + λ(v − u) for some λ ∈ R. Since, t|w − u| = s|w − v|, w − u and w − v are parallel, and W is not contained between U and V , it follows that t(w − u) = s(w − v) ⇐⇒ w = ( s s − t ) v − ( t s − t ) u. (6) (a) For s = 2 and t = 7, it follows from (6) that w = − 2 5 (−3, 1, −2) + 7 5 (2, −4, 3) = (4, −6, 5). (b) For s = 7 and t = 2, it follows from (6) that w = 7 5 (−3, 1, 2) − 2 5 (2, −4, 3) = (−5, 3, −4). Note that you can verify these answers are correct, ﬁrst by observing that they are on the correct line segment, but also by calculation |u − w| and |v − w|. Additionally ... what happens to the point w as s t → 1? ■ (B) Question 16. If D, E and F are the mid-points of the sides BC, CA and AB respectively of △ABC, the line segments AD, BE and CF are known as the medians of △ABC. If A, B and C have position vectors a, b and c relative to an origin O, ﬁnd the position vector of the point G on AD s.t. AG : GD = 2 : 1 and establish that G also lies on BE and CF . Hence prove that the medians of a triangle are concurrent (they all intersect). Solution: 8 A sketch of terms in the question. If G is on the line segment AD (between A and D, see Example 45) such that AG : GD = 2 : 1, then g = 1 3 a + 2 3 d. Since d = 1 2 (b + c) it follows that g = 1 3 a + 1 3 b + 1 3 c = 1 3 (a + b + c). (7) It follows that if G ′ is on the line segment BE (between B and E) such that BG′ : G ′E = 2 : 1, then g′ = 1 3 b + 2 3 e. Since e = 1 2 (a + c), it follows from (7) that g = 1 3 (a + b + c) = 1 3 b + 2 3 ( 1 2 (a + c)) = 1 3 b + 2 3 e = g ′. (8) Similarly, if G ′′ is on the line segment CF (between C and F ) such that CG ′′ : G′′F = 2 : 1, then g′′ = 1 3 c + 2 3 f. Since f = 1 2 (a + b), it follows again from (7) that g = 1 3 (a + b + c) = 1 3 c + 2 3 ( 1 2 (a + b) ) = 1 3 c + 2 3 f = g′′. (9) Therefore, via (7), (8) and (9) the medians of a triangle are concurrent (at the same point). ■ (B) Question 17. The triangle OAB has vertices at O (the origin) and at points A and B with position vectors a and b respectively. The point P is the midpoint of OA and Q is the midpoint of P B. The line OQ (extended) intersects AB at R. (a) Sketch a diagram of the information above. (b) Write down, in terms of a and b, the position vectors p and q of the points P and Q. (c) Find the vector form of the lines AB and OQ and hence ﬁnd the position vector r of R. In what ratio does R split AB? (d) If A has coordinates (4, −3) and B has coordinates (1, 3) show that OR is perpendicular to AB and ﬁnd the cosine of the angle A ˆOR. Solution: (a) (b) p = 1 2 a and q = 1 2 a + 1 2 (b − 1 2 a) = 1 4 a + 1 2 b. (c) The line LAB is given by r ′ = a + λ(b − a) for λ ∈ R. The line LOQ is given by r′ = µ ( 1 4 a + 1 2 b ) for µ ∈ R. To ﬁnd the point of intersection of LAB and LOQ set the equations for LAB and LOQ equal, i.e. a + λ(b − a) = µ ( 1 4 a + 1 2 b ) ⇐⇒ (1 − λ − µ 4 ) a + (λ − µ 2 ) b = 0. (10) 9 Since a and b are not co-linear, (10) holds if and only if (1 − λ − µ 4 ) = 0 and (λ − µ 2 ) = 0 ⇐⇒ µ = 4 3 and λ = 2 3 , i.e. the position vector of R is r = 1 3 a + 2 3 b. We conclude that AR : RB = 2 : 1. (d) ⃗OR = r = 1 3 (4, −3) + 2 3 (1, 3) = (2, 1) and ⃗AB = (b − a) = (−3, 6). Since (2, 1).(−3, 6) = −6 + 6 = 0 it follows that ⃗OR ⊥ ⃗AB. Additionally, since ⃗OA. ⃗OR = | ⃗OA|| ⃗OR| cos (θAOR), it follows that cos (θAOR) = (4, −3).(2, 1) √25√5 = 1 √5 . ■ (B) Question 18. Find the (non-reﬂex) angle between the vectors u = (1, 1, 0) and v = (0, −1, 1). Solution: Since |u| = √2, |v| = √2, it follows that if θ is the angle between u and v, then u.v = −1 = √2√2 cos θ. We conclude that cos θ = − 1 2 i.e. that θ = 2 3 π. ■ (B) Question 19. If U = (6, −2, 1), V = (5, 4, 2) and W = (6, −3, 4) respectively, determine: (i) the length of the sides of △U V W ; (ii) if ∠V U W is acute or obtuse. Solution: (i) Observe that | ⃗U V | = √ ( ⃗U V . ⃗U V ) = √(−1)2 + 62 + 12 = √38, | ⃗V W | = √ ( ⃗V W . ⃗V W ) = √(1)2 + (−7)2 + 22 = √54, | ⃗W U | = √ ( ⃗W U . ⃗W U ) = √(0)2 + (−1)2 + 32 = √10. (ii) An angle θ is: acute if 0 < θ < π 2 ; and obtuse if π 2 < θ < π. Let θ = ∠V U W . Since ⃗U V . ⃗U W = (−1, 6, 1).(0, −1, 3) = −3 < 0, it follows that cos θ = − 3 | ⃗U V || ⃗U W | < 0. Also, since 0 ≤ θ < π (non-reﬂex), it follows that π 2 < θ, i.e. θ is obtuse. ■ (B) Question 20. Find the components of the two unit vectors w = (w1, w2, w3) which make an angle of π/3 rad. with the vector u = (1, 0, −1) and an angle of π/4 rad with the vector v = (1, −2, −2). Show that these two unit vectors are perpendicular. Solution: Since w = (w1, w2, w3) is a unit vector, i.e. w2 1 + w2 2 + w2 3 = 1, (11) and makes an angle of π/3 rad with the vector u = (1, 0, −1) and an angle of π/4 rad with the vector v = (1, −2, −2), it follow that w.u = w1 − w3 = |w||u| cos (π/3) = 1 √2 , (12) 10 w.v = w1 − 2w2 − 2w3 = |w||v| cos (pi/4) = 3 √2 . (13) Since w must satisfy (12) and (13), it follows from subtracting (12) from (13), we have the system:    w1 − w3 = 1 √2 −2w2 − w3 = √2. (14) Therefore, the solution set to (12) and (13) is the solution to the (14) given by {(w1, w2, w3) = ( 1 √2 + t, − ( 1 √2 + t 2 ) , t ) : t ∈ R} . (15) The elements in the set in (15) that also satisfy (11) must satisfy ( 1 √2 + t)2 + (− 1 √2 − t 2 )2 + (t) 2 = 1 ⇐⇒ t ( 9 4 t + 3√2 2 ) = 0 ⇐⇒ t ∈ {0, − 2 √2 3 } , and hence, w(1) = ( 1 √2 , − 1 √2 , 0) and w(2) = ( − √2 6 , − √2 6 , − 2 √2 3 ) . Since, for the unit vectors w1 and w2, we have w(1).w(2) = − 1 6 + 1 6 + 0 = 0, it follows that w(1) ⊥ w(2), as required. ■ (B) Question 21. If u is a non-zero vector and u × v = u × w, is it necessarily true that v = w? Justify your answer. When u = (2, 3, −4) and v = (−3, −1, 2), ﬁnd a vector w (̸= v), if one exists, such that u × v = u × w. Solution: No. Via the distributive property, u × v = u × w ⇐⇒ u × (v − w) = 0. So provided that v − w ∥ u, then u × v = u × w. For instance, for u = (2, 3, −4) and v = (−3, −1, 2), if w = (−1, 2, −2) (which is not equal to v) then u × (w − v) = u × u = 0 ⇐⇒ u × w = u × v. ■ (B) Question 22. Determine all values of α, if any, for which u × v is perpendicular to u × w when (a) u = (1, 2, −1), v = (1, α, 1) and w = (2, −1, α); (b) u = (1, −1, 1), v = (1, 3, α) and w = (1, α, −1). Solution: (a) Since u × v = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 1 2 −1 1 α 1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = (2 + α, −2, α − 2) and u × w = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 1 2 −1 2 −1 α ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = (2α − 1, −(α + 2), −5), it follows that since u and w are non-zero, u × v ⊥ u × w ⇐⇒ (u × v).(u × w) = 0 ⇐⇒ (2 + α).(2α − 1) + 2(α + 2) − 5(α − 2) ⇐⇒ α2 + 6 = 0, and since α2 + 6 = 0 has no real solutions we conclude that u × v ̸⊥ u × w for all α ∈ R. (b) Since u × v = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 1 −1 1 1 3 α ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = (−(α + 3), 1 − α, 4) and u × w = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 1 −1 1 1 α −1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = (1 − α, 2, α + 1), 11 it follows that since u and w are non-zero, u × v ⊥ u × w ⇐⇒ (u × v).(u × w) = 0 ⇐⇒ −(α + 3)(1 − α) + 2(1 − α) + 4(1 + α) ⇐⇒ α2 + 4α + 3 = 0 ⇐⇒ (α + 3)(α + 1) = 0, and hence u × v ⊥ u × w for α ∈ R if and only if, α = −3 or α = −1. ■ (B) Question 23. Using the deﬁnition given in lectures for u × v in the case where u and v are two non-zero vectors which are not parallel, establish that if u is a non-zero vector and v is a vector such that u = v × (u × v), then v is a unit vector which is perpendicular to u. Solution: First observe that u = v × (u × v) =⇒ v.u = v.(v × (u × v)) = 0, since v ⊥ (v × (u × v)). We conclude that v ⊥ u. Consequently, we have |u| = |v × (u × v)| = |v||u × v| sin ( π 2 ) = |v|2|u| (sin ( π 2 ))2 ⇐⇒ |v|2 = 1 ⇐⇒ |v| = 1. Therefore, v is a unit vector perpendicular to u, as required. ■ (B) Question 24. Obtain the components of a vector which is perpendicular to the vectors represented by ⃗AB and ⃗CD where A = (1, −2, −3), B = (4, 1, 1), C = (0, 1, −1) and D = (−6, 1, 3). Hence obtain scalar equations for two parallel planes π and π′ where π contains A and B, and π′ contains C and D. Calculate the distance between Π and Π′. Solution: Since ⃗AB = (3, 3, 4) and ⃗CD = (−6, 0, 4), it follows that a vector perpendicular to ⃗AB and ⃗CD is ⃗AB × ⃗CD = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 3 3 4 −6 0 4 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = (12, −36, 18). Since ⃗AB × ⃗CD is perpendicular to both planes, Π and Π′, it follows that Π and Π′ are given respectively by: (12, −36, 18).(x, y, z) = (12, −36, 18).(1, −2, −3) ⇐⇒ 12x − 36y + 18z = 30 (16) (12, −36, 18).(x, y, z) = (12, −36, 18).(0, 1, −1) ⇐⇒ 12x − 36y + 18z = −54. (17) Therefore, the distance between the two planes is given by |d − d ′| |n| = |30 − (−54)| √62(22 + 62 + 32) = 84 42 = 2. Note that to apply the formula to calculate the distance between the two planes above, we need to keep the LHS of (16) and (17) equal (not a (non-1) scalar multiple of the other). ■ (B) Question 25. Find an equation of the plane Π which contains the point U = (5, 0, 2) and the line L given by the parametric equations x = 1 + 3t, y = 4 − 2t, z = −3 + t. Solution: Since the direction of the line L is (3, −2, 1), and for t = 0, (1, 4, −3) is on L with (1, 4, −3) ̸∥ (3, −2, 1), it follows that a normal vector to the plane Π is given by ((5, 0, 2) − (1, 4, −3)) × (3, −2, 1) = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ i j k 4 −4 5 3 −2 1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = (6, 11, 4). Therefore, the plane Π is given by 6x + 11y + 4z = 38. ■ 12 (B) Question 26. Prove that if u, v and w are distinct non-zero vectors such that u × (v × w) = 0 and (u × v) × w = 0, then either u, v and w are parallel or u, v and w are mutually perpendicular. Solution: Since u × (v × w) = 0 it follows that we have two cases to consider: (i) If v × w = 0 then since v and w are non-zero vectors, it follows that v ∥ w =⇒ (u × v) ∥ (u × w) or (u || v || w). (18) Now, suppose that u ̸∥ v. Then since u and v are non-zero it follows that u × v ̸= 0 and moreover, from the second equation above that (u × v) ∥ w (19) Thus, via (18) and (19) it follows that (u × w) ∥ (u × v) ∥ w which is a contradiction. Therefore, u ∥ v ∥ w, as required. (ii) If v × w ̸= 0, then it follows from the the hypothesis that u ∥ (v × w) which implies that u ⊥ v and u ⊥ w. Consequently, the hypothesis implies that w ∥ (u × v) which further implies that v ⊥ w. Therefore, u ⊥ v ⊥ w ⊥ u, as required. ■ 13","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
