A particle of mass m has Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) at time t given by x = U t cos α, y = 0 and z = − 1 2 gt 2 + U t sin α. (a) Determine expressions for the velocity v and the acceleration a of the particle. [4] (b) Determine the kinetic energy of the particle. [2] (c) Determine the net force acting on the particle. [2] (d) Brieﬂy describe what this set of equations represents. [2] 2. A particle is located at position r with respect to the origin of a 2-dimensional co-ordinate system. If i and j are the unit vectors in a (x, y) Cartesian co-ordinate system and er and eθ are the unit vectors in a (r, θ) polar coordinate system given by er = cos θi + sin θj and eθ = − sin θi + cos θj then determine an expression for the velocity dr dt of the particle in polar coordinates. [3] If a particle’s location in Cartesian co-ordinates is (x, y) = (1, t), what is the particle’s velocity in polar co-ordinates [3] ? Turn over - 3 - Any Calculator SECTION B 3. (a) What is Hooke’s law? [2] (b) A particle of mass m is attached to a spring which has a spring constant k. The natural length of the spring is a, and the only force that acts on the particle is due to the spring. If x measures the displacement of the particle from some ﬁxed point along the line of the spring, then use Newton’s second law to determine a diﬀerential equation for x. [3] (c) Show that the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of the particle in part (b) is constant. [5] (d) A mechanical vibration is described by d2x dt2 + α dx dt + ω2x = f (t) where x measures displacement, t is time, α and ω are dimensional constants which characterize the system, and f (t) is some time dependent function which represents an external forcing. At time t = 0, assume that x = 1 and dx dt = 0. If α = 0 and f (t) = 0 then determine an expression for x in terms of t. [4] Describe brieﬂy the nature of the oscillation. [1] If α = 1, ω = 1 and f (t) = 0 then determine an expression for x in terms of t. [4] Describe brieﬂy the nature of the oscillation. [1] If α = 0, ω = 1 and f (t) = cos(t) then determine an expression for x in terms of t. [4] Describe brieﬂy the nature of the oscillation. [1] ? - 4 - Any Calculator 4. In polar coordinates Newton’s second law for a particle of mass m can be written as F = Frer + Fθeθ = m ([ d2r dt2 − r ( dθ dt )2] er + [ 2 dr dt dθ dt + r d2θ dt2 ] eθ ) . Assume that the particle is subject to a central force with Fr = g(r) (for some function g) and Fθ = 0. (a) Show that the quantity h = r2 dθ dt is constant and hence or otherwise show that the position vector of the particle sweeps out equal areas about the origin in equal times. [8] (b) If u = 1/r show that the radial component of Newton’s second law becomes d2u dθ2 + u = − g (1/u) mh2u2 , where h is the constant identiﬁed above. [10] (c) Assume that g(r) = −γ/r2 + λ/r3 where γ and λ are positive dimensional constants. What are the dimensions of γ and λ? Determine the orbit of the particle.
