(convex towards object); otherwise, it is negative ( concave towards object). Thin lenses: Thickness of lens is much smaller than the radius. Consider a lens of refractive index nl with the refractive index of the medium nm. Object is P. nm nm d nl Image P’ is formed by refraction at each surface separately. 1st, Consider refraction at the first surface: It gives image P1’. A virtual image. Applying usual equation for a surface….to the first surface Equa. (A) gives you s1’. In this case the image distance s1’ is negative (virtual image to the left). r nn s n s n )( ' 1221   nm nm So rays at second surface behave as if they came from P1’ in a straight line.

Biconcave lens r1<0, r2>0 Other types of lenses: f can be calculated for each individual lens, and it depends on r1 and r2. P=1/f is called the power of the lens measured in units of dioptres (1/m) A lens with a shorter focal length is a more powerful lens. Ray tracing F F’ Parallel ray Central Ray Focal Ray y y’ Note: central ray is undeflected as faces of lens are parallel – just like looking through a window (get slight displacement) Converging lens FF’ Parallel ray Central ray Focal rayy y’ Diverging lens Example 1 Plane – convex lens of refractive index of 1.5 and convex radius of curvature of 15 cm. What is the focal length? r2<0 C2 This is a converging lens Example 2 An object 1.2 cm high is placed 4 cm from a double convex lens (radii of curvature 10 and 15 cm, refractive index 1.5). Locate the image, and perform the ray tracing. Is the image real or virtual, and what is its height? r2 = –15 cm r 1=10 cm C1 10 cm15 cm C2 F F’ Focal Parallel Central So image is to left of lens and thus virtual Image is magnified Diagram to scale 12 cm Systems with more than one lens F F’ Focal Parallel Central Imagine a second lens (f = +6 cm) is placed 12 cm to the right of the previous lens F2 F2’ Changed image from virtual to real s2 s2’ http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refrn/U14L5da.cfm http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/raydiag.html This page is for the very keen.
