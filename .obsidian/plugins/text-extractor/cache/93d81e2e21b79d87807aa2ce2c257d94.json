Questions are ranked in difficulty from A (basic) to C (challenging). (A) Question 1. Show that each of the following equations represents a single straight line. (a) x2 + 4xy − 6x + 4y2 − 12y + 9 = 0. (b) x2 − 4xy + 2x + 4y2 − 4y + 1 = 0. Solution: (a) Assume that x2 + 4xy − 6x + 4y2 − 12y + 9 = (ax + by + c) 2 ⇐⇒ x2 + 4xy − 6x + 4y2 − 12y + 9 = a2x2 + 2abxy + b2y + 2acx + 2bcy + c2 From the coeﬃcients of x2, y2 and the constant term respectively, it follows that a = ±1, b = ±2 and c = ±3. We now match the remaining coeﬃcients: (xy) : 2ab = 4 ⇐⇒ ab = 2 ⇐⇒ (a, b) = (1, 2) or (a, b) = (−1, −2) (x) : 2ac = −6 ⇐⇒ ac = −3 ⇐⇒ (a, c) = (1, −3) or (a, c) = (−1, 3) (y) : 2bc = −12 ⇐⇒ bc = −6 ⇐⇒ (b, c) = (2, −3) or (b, c) = (−2, 3). It follows that the quadratic equation represents the line x + 2y − 3 = 0. (b) Assume that x2 − 4xy + 2x + 4y2 − 4y + 1 = (ax + by + c) 2 ⇐⇒ x2 − 4xy + 2x + 4y2 − 4y + 1 = a2x2 + 2abxy + b2y + 2acx + 2bcy + c2 From the coeﬃcients of x2, y2 and the constant term respectively, it follows that a = ±1, b = ±2 and c = ±1. We now match the remaining coeﬃcients: (xy) : 2ab = −4 ⇐⇒ ab = −2 ⇐⇒ (a, b) = (1, −2) or (a, b) = (−1, 2) (x) : 2ac = 2 ⇐⇒ ac = 1 ⇐⇒ (a, c) = (1, 1) or (a, c) = (−1, −1) (y) : 2bc = −4 ⇐⇒ bc = −2 ⇐⇒ (b, c) = (2, −1) or (b, c) = (−2, 1). It follows that the quadratic equation represents the line x − 2y + 1 = 0. ■ (A) Question 2. Show that each of the following equations represents a pair of straight lines and ﬁnd their point of intersection. (a) 2x2 − xy + x − y2 + 2y − 1 = 0. (b) 2x2 − xy + 5x − y2 + y + 2 = 0. Solution: (a) For this to be true, the it must be represented by some single line ax + by + c. Since the equation is quadratic, we must have 2x2 − xy − y2 + x + 2y − 1 = (ax + by + c)(dx + ey + f ) ⇐⇒ 2x2 − xy − y2 + x + 2y − 1 = adx 2 + (ae + bd)xy + bey2 + (af + dc)x + (bf + ce)y + cf 1 2 VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS Since for each line, we can freely choose 1 of the coeﬃcients, we set a = 2 and d = 1 so that the x2 coeﬃcient is correct. We now match the remaining coeﬃcients: (1) (xy) : 2e + b = −1 ⇐⇒ b = −(1 + 2e) (y2) : be = −1 ⇐⇒ b = − 1 e (x) : 2f + c = 1 ⇐⇒ c = 1 − 2f (y) : bf + ce = 2 ⇐⇒ bf = 2 − ce (x0) : cf = −1 ⇐⇒ f = − 1 c Via lines 1 and 2 in (1), it follows that (2) 2eb + b2 = −b ⇐⇒ b2 + b − 2 = 0 ⇐⇒ (b + 2)(b − 1) = 0 ⇐⇒ (i) b = 1 or (ii) b = −2. Therefore, via (2) and line 2 in (1), we have (3) (i) e = −1 or (ii) e = 1 2. Now, via lines 4 and 5 in (1), and (2) and (3), it follows that (4) bcf + c2e = 2c ⇐⇒ c2e − 2c − b = 0 ⇐⇒   (i) −(c + 1)2 = 0 ⇐⇒ c = −1 (ii) 1 2(c − 2) 2 = 0 ⇐⇒ c = 2. Via line 5 in (1) and (4), it follows that (5) f = − 1 c ⇐⇒ (i) f = 1 or (ii) f = − 1 2. Since c and f given in (4) and (5) also satisfy line 3 in (1), it follows from all of the above that the quadratic equation is solved by 2 distinct lines L1 and L2, given by 2x2 − xy − y2 + x + 2y − 1 = (2x + y − 1) (x − y + 1) = 0, i.e. L1 : 2x + y − 1 = 0 and L2 : x − y + 1 = 0. Note that there were 2 cases because we could have represented the two lines in two diﬀerent orders. The point of intersection of L1 and L2 can be found by substitution to be (x, y) = (0, 1). (b) After comparably arduous calculations one can determine that the quadratic equation is solved by 2 distinct lines L1 and L2, given by 2x2 − xy − y2 + 5x + y + 2 = (2x + y + 1)(x − y + 2) = 0, i.e. L1 : 2x + y + 1 = 0 and L2 : x − y + 2 = 0. The point of intersection of L1 and L2 is (x, y) = (−1, 1). We will revisit questions 1 and 2, and demonstrate an approach based on Section 6.1 of the notes ... once we have covered Chapter 10. Speciﬁcally we will show how to choose a suitable rotation of the xy plane to simplify the original quadratic equations in 2 variables (to eliminate the xy terms). ■ (A) Question 3. By completing the square (translation), eliminate the linear terms in the following equations, and hence, identify the conics. (a) 3x2 + 24x + 53 − 2y2 + 4y = 0; (b) 2x2 − 4x + 10 + 4y2 + 16y = 0; (c) y2 − 2y − 11 − 6x = 0. Solution: VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS 3 (a) Since 3x2+24x+53−2y2+4y = 0 ⇐⇒ 3(x+4) 2−48−2(y−1)2+2+53 = 0 ⇐⇒ (y − 1) 2 7/2 −(x + 4)2 7/3 = 1, it follows that the equation deﬁnes a hyperbola. To see this slightly more clearly, consider the translated co-ordinates ˜x = x + 4 and ˜y = y − 1. (b) Since 2x2−4x+10+4y2+16y = 0 ⇐⇒ 2(x−1) 2−2+4(y+2) 2−16+10 = 0 ⇐⇒ (x − 1)2 4 + (y + 2)2 2 = 1, it follows that the equation deﬁnes an ellipse. (c) Since y2 − 2y − 11 − 6x = 0 ⇐⇒ (y − 1) 2 − 1 − 6x − 11 = 0 ⇐⇒ (y − 1)2 = 6(x + 2), it follows that the equation deﬁnes a parabola. ■ (A) Question 4. Find equations, in x, y co-ordinates, for the given ellipses. (a) Foci at (0, ±2) semi-major axis (or equivalently, the distance from centre to ver- tex) 3; (b) Foci at (0, 1) and (4, 1) and eccentricity 1 2; Solution: (a) Since the foci are at (0, ±2) it follows that: the form of the ellipse is x2 b2 + y2 a2 = 1; and 2 2 = c2 = a2 − b2. Since the semi-major axis is 3, it follows that a = 3. Hence the equation for the ellipse is x2 5 + y2 9 = 1. Note that the semi-major axis is half the length of the major axis. (b) The centre of the ellipse is (x, y) = (2, 1). Since the foci are at (x, y) = (0, 1) and (x, y) = (4, 1) it follows that: the form of the ellipse is (x−2)2 a2 + (y−1)2 b2 = 1; and 2 2 = c2 = a2 − b2. Also, since 1 2 = e = c a = 2 a it follows that a = 4. Therefore, the ellipse is given by (x − 2) 2 16 + (y − 1) 2 12 = 1. ■ (A) Question 5. Sketch the following ellipses and ﬁnd their centre and semi-axes. (a) 9x2 + 4y2 − 18x + 8y = 23; (b) 2x2 − 4x + 10 + 4y2 + 16y = 0. Solution: (a) Since 9x2+4y2−18x+8y = 23 ⇐⇒ 9(x−1) 2−9+4(y+1) 2−4 = 23 ⇐⇒ (x − 1)2 4 +(y + 1)2 9 = 1, the equation deﬁnes an ellipse with semi-major axis 3 and parallel to the y-axis; semi-minor axis 2; and with centre at (x, y) = (1, −1). 4 VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS (b) Since 2x2−4x+10+4y2+16y = 0 ⇐⇒ 2(x−1) 2−2+4(y+2) 2−16+10 = 0 ⇐⇒ (x − 1)2 4 + (y + 2)2 2 = 1, the equation deﬁnes an ellipse with semi-major axis 2 and parallel to the x-axis; semi-minor axis √ 2; and with centre at (x, y) = (1, −2). ■ (A) Question 6. Find the vertex, focus and directrix of the parabola with equation (a) y = −(1/6)x2; (b) 2y2 = −3x; and (c) y2 = 100x. Solution: (a) Since y = −(1/6)x2 ⇐⇒ x2 = −6y, the parabola has p = 3 2 and is opening downwards. The vertex is at (x, y) = (0, 0), the focus is at (x, y) = (0, − 3 2) and the directrix is y = 3 2. (b) Since 2y2 = −3x ⇐⇒ − 3 2x = y2 it follows that the parabola has p = 3 8 and opens to the left. The vertex is at (x, y) = (0, 0), the focus is at (x, y) = (− 3 8, 0) and the directrix is x = 3 8. (c) Since y2 = 100x, the parabola has p = 25 and is opening to the right. The vertex is at (x, y) = (0, 0), the focus is at (x, y) = (25, 0) and the directrix is x = −25. ■ (A) Question 7. Find the equation of the parabola with vertex V (x, y) = (−4, 2) and directrix y = 5 and sketch it. Solution: Since the vertex is at (−4, 2) and the directrix is y = 5, it follows that the focus is at (−4, −1) and p = 3. Therefore, the parabola has equation −12(y − 2) = (x + 4)2. ■ VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS 5 (A) Question 8. Find the equation of the tangent to the parabola with equation y2 = x at the point P (x, y) = (16, −4). Solution: We ﬁnd the tangent line by implicit diﬀerentiation (for y ̸= 0) d dx (y2) = d dx (x) ⇐⇒ 2y dy dx = 1 ⇐⇒ dy dx = 1 2y , and hence at (x, y) = (16, −4), we have dy dx = − 1 8. Therefore, the tangent to the parabola at (x, y) = (16, −4) is y + 4 = −1 8(x − 16). Note that at y = 0 the tangent, in the form y = mx + c is undeﬁned since the tangent at (x, y) = (0, 0) is of the form x = 0. ■ (A) Question 9. Find the vertices and the foci of the hyperbola with given equation. Moreover, sketch the hyperbola, asymptotes and foci. (a) y2/9 − x2/4 = 1; (b) x2 − 2y2 = 8. Solution: (a) Since y2/9 − x2/4 = 1, it follows that: the focal axis is the y-axis; the vertices are at (x, y) = (0, ±3); the foci are at (x, y) = (0, ±√ 13) since c2 = a2 + b2; and the asymptotes are given by y = ± 3 2x. (b) Since x2 − 2y2 = 8 ⇐⇒ x2 8 − y2 4 = 1, it follows that: the focal axis is the x-axis; the vertices are at (x, y) = (±√8, 0); the foci are at (x, y) = (±√ 12, 0) since c2 = a2 + b2; and the asymptotes are given by y = ± 1√2x. ■ (A) Question 10. Find the equation of the tangent to the hyperbola with equation x2 6 − y2 8 = 1, at the point P (x, y) = (3, 2). 6 VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS Solution: We ﬁnd the tangent line by implicit diﬀerentiation (y ̸= 0) d dx (x2 6 − y2 8 ) = d dx (1) ⇐⇒ x 3 − y 4 dy dx = 0 ⇐⇒ dy dx = 4x 3y , and hence at (x, y) = (3, 2), we have dy dx = 2. Therefore, the tangent to the hyperbola at (x, y) = (3, 2) is y − 2 = 2(x − 3). Note that here we could have used the formula directly from the notes, but hopefully it is clear that this approach can be used to ﬁnd the tangent to hyperbola not necessarily with centre at (0,0). ■ (B) Question 11. By rotating the coordinate system in the following equations, eliminate the cross term xy. Hence identify the type of conics from the equations. (a) 2x2 + 2xy + 2y2 − 5 = 0; (b) −2x2 + 2√3xy − 4 = 0; (c) 3 4 x2 + xy √ 3 2 + y2 4 + 6x − 6y√3 = 0. Solution: In general, given a real-valued quadratic equation Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0, if we can ﬁnd θ such that tan (2θ) = B A − C or cot (2θ) = A − C B , we can deﬁne a rotation of the xy plane to the ˜x˜y plane so that the quadratic equation in ˜x and ˜y has no ˜x˜y term. (a) Since here, we have cot (2θ) = 0 ⇐⇒ 2θ = π 2 + kπ ⇐⇒ θ = π 4 + kπ 2 , we can set θ = π 4 , i.e. ( x y ) = ( cos ( π 4 ) − sin ( π 4 ) sin ( π 4 ) cos ( π 4 ) ) ( ˜x ˜y ) = ( 1√2(˜x − ˜y) 1√2(˜x + ˜y) ) . Thus, we have 2x2 + 2xy + 2y2 − 5 = 0 ⇐⇒ (˜x − ˜y) 2 + (˜x − ˜y)(˜x + ˜y) + (˜x + ˜y)2 − 5 = 0 ⇐⇒ ˜x2 − 2˜x˜y + ˜y2 + ˜x2 − ˜y2 + ˜x2 + 2˜x˜y + ˜y2 − 5 = 0 ⇐⇒ ˜x2 5/3 + ˜y2 5 = 1 which is an ellipse. (b) Since here, we have tan (2θ) = −√3 ⇐⇒ 2θ = −π 3 + kπ ⇐⇒ θ = −π 6 + kπ 2 , we can set θ = − π 6 , i.e. ( x y ) = ( cos (− π 6 ) − sin (− π 6 ) sin (− π 6 ) cos (− π 6 ) ) ( ˜x ˜y ) = ( √3 2 ˜x + 1 2 ˜y − 1 2 ˜x + √3 2 ˜y ) . VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS 7 Thus, we have −2x2 + 2√ 3xy − 4 = 0 ⇐⇒ −2 (√3 2 ˜x + 1 2 ˜y )2 + 2√3 ( √3 2 ˜x + 1 2 ˜y ) ( −1 2 ˜x + √3 2 ˜y ) − 4 = 0 ⇐⇒ −3˜x2 + (√ 3 − √3)˜x˜y + ˜y2 − 4 = 0 ⇐⇒ ˜y2 4 − ˜x2 4/3 = 1 which is a hyperbola. (c) Since here, we have tan (2θ) = √3 ⇐⇒ 2θ = π 3 + kπ ⇐⇒ θ = π 6 + kπ 2 , we can set θ = π 6 , i.e. ( x y ) = ( cos ( π 6 ) − sin ( π 6 ) sin ( π 6 ) cos ( π 6 ) ) ( ˜x ˜y ) = ( √ 3 2 ˜x − 1 2 ˜y 1 2 ˜x + √3 2 ˜y ) . Thus, we have 3 4 x2 + xy √ 3 2 + y2 4 + 6x − 6y√ 3 = 0 ⇐⇒ 3 4 (√3 2 ˜x − 1 2 ˜y )2 + √3 2 ( √ 3 2 ˜x − 1 2 ˜y ) ( 1 2 ˜x + √3 2 ˜y ) +1 4 ( 1 2 ˜x + √3 2 ˜y )2 + 6 ( √ 3 2 ˜x − 1 2 ˜y ) − 6 √3 (1 2 ˜x + √3 2 ˜y ) = 0 ⇐⇒ ( 9 16 + 3 8 + 1 16 ) ˜x2 + ( −3 √3 8 + 3 √3 8 − √ 3 8 + √3 8 ) ˜x˜y + ( 3 16 − 3 8 + 3 16 ) ˜y2 + (3√3 − 3 √ 3)˜x + (−3 − 9)˜y = 0 ⇐⇒ ˜x2 = 12˜y which is a parabola. ■ (B) Question 12. By a combination of rotation and translation, simplify the following equations so they are given by a standard equation for a conic. You may ﬁnd it helpful to use the double angle formula for tan (2θ). (a) 34x2 + 24xy − 40x + 41y2 + 30y = 0; (b) 39x2 − 96xy − 270x + 11y2 + 140y = 0. Solution: (a) Here, we have tan (2θ) = −24 7 ⇐⇒ 2 tan (θ) 1 − tan2 (θ) = −24 7 ⇐⇒ 24 tan2 (θ) − 14 tan (θ) − 24 = 0 ⇐⇒ tan (θ) = 4 3 or tan (θ) = −3 4. 8 VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS Since tan (θ) = 4 3 = 4.5 3.5 = sin (θ) cos (θ), it follows that we can consider θ such that sin (θ) = 4 5 and cos (θ) = 3 5 i.e. ( x y ) = ( 3 5 − 4 5 4 5 3 5 ) · ( ˜x ˜y ) = ( 3 5 ˜x − 4 5 ˜y 4 5 ˜x + 3 5 ˜y ) . Therefore, 34x2 + 24xy − 40x + 41y2 + 30y = 0 ⇐⇒ 34 ( 3 5 ˜x − 4 5 ˜y)2 + 24 ( 3 5 ˜x − 4 5 ˜y) ( 4 5 ˜x + 3 5 ˜y) −40 ( 3 5 ˜x − 4 5 ˜y) + 41 ( 4 5 ˜x + 3 5 ˜y)2 + 30 ( 4 5 ˜x + 3 5 ˜y) = 0 ⇐⇒ ( 9.34 25 + 12.24 25 + 16.41 25 ) ˜x2 + ( 16.34 25 − 12.24 25 + 9.41 25 ) ˜y2 + (−24.34 25 + 9.24 25 − 16.24 25 + 24.41 25 ) ˜x˜y + (−24 + 24)˜x + (32 + 18)˜y = 0 ⇐⇒ 50˜x2 + 25(˜y + 1)2 = 25 ⇐⇒ ˜x2 1/2 + (˜y + 1)2 = 1. Hence the quadratic equation above represents an ellipse. Moreover, via the translation ˆx = ˜x and ˆy = ˜y + 1, it follows that in the ˆxˆy co-ordinate system, the ellipse is in standard form with a2 = 1/2 and b2 = 1. (b) With θ as in (a), it follows that the equation 39x2 − 96xy − 270x + 11y2 + 140y = 0 ⇐⇒ (˜y + 2)2 11/3 − (˜x + 1)2 11 = 1, from which it follows that the quadratic equation represents a hyperbola. More- over, via the translation ˆx = ˜x + 1 and ˆy = ˜y + 2, it follows that in the ˆxˆy co- ordinate system, the hyperbola is in standard form with a2 = 11/3 and b2 = 11. ■ (B) Question 13. Find the equations of the tangent and the normal lines to the given curves at the given value of x. Note this means there may be two possible values of y and hence two tangent lines and two normal lines. Use implicit diﬀerentiation to solve this question. (a) 2x2 + 2xy + 2y2 − 5 = 0, x = 0; (b) 34x2 + 24xy − 40x + 41y2 + 30y = 0, x = 0; (c) 8x2 + 12xy + 17y2 − 20, x = 1. Solution: (a) At x = 0, it follows that 2y2 −5 = 0 ⇐⇒ y = ± √10 2 . Implicit diﬀerentiation (and the product rule for diﬀerentiation) of the equation gives (where the derivative exists) 4x + 2y + 2x dy dx + 4y dy dx = 0 ⇐⇒ dy dx = −2x + y x + 2y ⇐⇒ dy dx = −1 2. VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS 9 Therefore, the tangent lines are given by y − √10 2 = −1 2x at (x, y) = ( 0, √ 10 2 ) and y + √10 2 = −1 2x at (x, y) = ( 0, −√10 2 ) . The normal lines are given by y − √ 10 2 = 2x at (x, y) = ( 0, √ 10 2 ) and y + √10 2 = 2x at (x, y) = ( 0, −√10 2 ) . The solutions to parts (b) and (c) follows a similar argument. ■ (B) Question 14. If an ellipse is deﬁned parametrically by y = 2 √2 sin θ x = 4 cos θ − 1 show that the normal to the ellipse at θ = π 3 intersects (x, y) = (0, 0). Solution: Observe that x2 = 16 cos2(θ) − 8 cos(θ) + 1 and y2 = 8 sin2(θ). Therefore, 2y2 + x2 = 16(cos 2(θ) + sin2(θ)) − 2(4 cos(θ) − 1) − 1 2y2 + x2 = 16 − 2x − 1 ⇐⇒ 2y2 + x2 + 2x = 15 ⇐⇒ 2y2 + (x + 1)2 + 16 ⇐⇒ (x + 1)2 16 + y2 8 = 1. For θ = π 3 we have (x, y) = (1, √6). By implicit diﬀerentiation, it follows that (x + 1) 8 + y 4 dy dx = 0 ⇐⇒ dy dx = −(x + 1) 2y . Therefore, the normal to the ellipse at(x, y) = (1, √6) has gradient √6, and hence the normal to the ellipse at (x, y) = (1, √ 6) is given by y − √6 = √ 6(x − 1) ⇐⇒ y = √6x, which intersects (x, y) = (0, 0), as required. ■ (B) Question 15. Find the equation of the parabola that satisﬁes the given conditions. (a) Focus F (3, 0) and directrix x = −3; (b) Vertex V (−2, 3) and directrix y = 6. Solution: (a) It follows that the distance from the focus to the directrix is 6, so p = 3. Therefore the vertex is at (0,0) and the parabola is given by y2 = 12x. (b) Since the distance from the vertex to the directrix is 3, it follows that p = 3. The parabola opens downwards with centre (−2, 3), hence it has equation 12(y − 3) = −(x + 2)2. ■ (B) Question 16. Find the vertex and focus of the given parabola and sketch it. (a) y = x2 − 4x + 2; 10 VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS (b) 4x2 + 40x + y + 106 = 0. Solution: (a) Since y = x2 − 4x + 2 ⇐⇒ y = (x − 2) 2 − 4 + 2 ⇐⇒ y + 2 = (x − 2) 2, it follows that the parabola has vertex (x, y) = (2, −2) and focus (x, y) = (2, − 7 4) (note that p = 1 4). (b) Since 4x2 + 40x + y + 106 = 0 ⇐⇒ 4(x + 5) 2 − 100 + y + 106 = 0 ⇐⇒ −(y + 6) 4 = (x + 5) 2, it follows that the parabola has vertex (x, y) = (−5, −6) and focus (x, y) = (−5, − 97 16) (note that p = 1 16). ■ (B) Question 17. Find the equation of the tangents to y = (x − 1) 2 + 8 that intersect the (0,0). Solution: By diﬀerentiating the equation implicitly, it follows that dy dx = 2(x − 1). Hence the tangent at the point (x1, y1) on the parabola is given by y − y1 = 2(x1 − 1)(x − x1) ⇐⇒ y = 2(x1 − 1)x − 2(x2 1 − x1) + y1. Therefore, the tangents to the parabola that intersect the origin are precisely those that satisfy −2(x2 1−x1)+y1 = 0 ⇐⇒ −2(x2 1−x1)+(x1−1) 2+8 = 0 ⇐⇒ −x2 1+9 = 0 ⇐⇒ x1 = ±3. We conclude that the tangents to the parabola at (x, y) = (3, 12) and (x, y) = (−3, 24) given by y = 4x and y = −8x respectively, are precisely those that intersect (x, y) = (0, 0). ■ VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS 11 (B) Question 18. Find an equation for the hyperbola with centre at (0,0) and: (a) has foci F (±5, 0) and vertices V (±3, 0); (b) has vertices V (±4, 0) and intersects P (8, 2). Solution: Hyperbolae with centre at (0, 0) and vertices on the x-axis are of the form x2 a2 − y2 b2 = 1. (a) Since the vertices are at (x, y) = (±3, 0) it follows that a = 3. Since the foci are at (x, y) = (±5, 0) it follows that b2 = c2 − a2 = 52 − 3 2 = 16. We conclude that the hyperbola has equation x2 9 − y2 16 = 1. (b) Since the vertices are at (x, y) = (±4, 0) it follows that a = 4. Since the hyperbola intersects (x, y) = (8, 2) it follows that 8 2 16 − 2 2 b2 = 1 ⇐⇒ b2 = 4 3 . We conclude that the hyperbola has equation x2 16 − y2 4/3 = 1. ■ (B) Question 19. You should be able to make a suitable rotation and translation to the conic in standard form to derive your answer, after sketching the conic. (a) For the parabola with directrix y = 1√3x and focus at F (− 1 2, √3 2 ), sketch the vertex, axis of the parabola, focus and directrix on the xy-plane. Additionally, determine a quadratic equation in x and y that describes the parabola. (b) For the ellipse foci F1(− √2, 0) and F2(0, −√ 2) and eccentricity e = 1 2, sketch the vertices, major axis, minor axis, foci and directrices on the xy-plane. Additionally, determine a quadratic equation in x and y that describes the ellipse. Solution: (a) The axis for the parabola is perpendicular to the directrix and intersects the focus, so has the form y − √ 3 2 = −√ 3 (x + 1 2 ) ⇐⇒ y = − √3x. Therefore, the vertex is at (− 1 4, √3 4 ). Since | ⃗OV | = (( √3 4 ) 2 + (− 1 4 ))1/2 = 1 2 it follows that p = 1 2. 12 VGLA: CONICS PRACTISE QUESTIONS Now, in standard form, the parabola is given by ¯x2 = 4p¯y = 2¯y. Since the major axis has an angle π 6 with the positive y axis, we consider the following transformations to go to xy co-ordinates. ¯x ¯y ) = ˜x ˜y − 1 2 ) and ˜x ˜y ) =   cos ( π 6 ) sin ( π 6 ) − sin ( π 6 ) cos ( π 6 )   · x y ) = √3 2 x + 1 2y − 1 2x + √3 2 y ) ■ (C) Question 20. Give a deﬁnition for the set of points in the plane that deﬁne a circle (see the deﬁnitions of a parabola, ellipse and hyperbola in the notes). Also, derive the standard equation of a circle 1 2 (x2 + y2) = 1 with centre (0,0) (proceed as in the proof of Theorem 6.13 ... albeit not for a as long). Solution: A circle is the set of points in a plane which are a constant distance a > 0 from a fixed point C in the plane. The standard equation of a circle with centre C(0, 0) is given by 1 a2 (x2 + y2) = 1, with a = | ⃗P C|. Proof: For P (x, y) on the circle | ⃗P F | = a, or equivalently, √ x2 + y2 = a ⇐⇒ x2 + y2 = a2 ⇐⇒ 1 a2 (x 2 + y2) = 1, as required. ■","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
