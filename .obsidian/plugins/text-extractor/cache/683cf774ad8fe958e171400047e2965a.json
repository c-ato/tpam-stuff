You may attempt more questions, but marks in excess of 40% will be disregarded. Section 2 consists of three questions and carries 60% of the marks. Answer two questions from this Section. If you answer more than two questions, credit will only be given for the best two answers. The approximate allocation of marks to each part of a question is shown in brackets [ ]. All symbols have their usual meanings. Calculators may be used in this examination but must not be used to store text.

You may attempt as many questions as you wish, but any marks in excess of 40% will be disregarded. 1. In an inertial frame Σ two events are separated by a time interval of 3 s and occur at distance 8 × 108 m away from each other. (a) Can the earlier event be the cause for the later one? [3] (b) Calculate the square of space-time invariant interval ∆s2 between the events and ﬁnd the proper time between the events. [4] (c) Find the velocity (relative to Σ) of the frame Σ′ in which the events happen in the same space location. [3] 2. A relativistic brick is thrown at angle 45◦ with velocity u′ = c/√2 inside a space ship which moves with velocity 3c/5 in the positive x-direction with respect to the earth. Find the tangent of the angle of the brick’s velocity with respect to x-axis in the earth’s inertial frame. [10] 3. Two particles each having rest mass m are approaching each other with velocity v (in some inertial frame). After colliding they form a bigger particle with rest mass M . (a) Write down the equation for conserved energy and momentum and also write down the rest mass M of the resulting particle in terms of m and v. [3] (b) Transforming into frame Σ′ where one of the colliding particles is at rest, ﬁnd the velocity v′ of the other particle. [3] (c) State the energy conservation equation in the frame Σ′ in terms of m, v and v′. By using the results of part (b), verify that energy is conserved in the moving frame Σ′. [4] 4. A spy went to a pub where he has 1/8 chance to get drunk. When the spy is drunk he is ten times more likely to reveal state secrets than when he is sober. If A22622 Page 2 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR the state secrets were found to be leaked by the spy calculate the chance he was under inﬂuence of alcohol. [10] 5. Consider the generating function g(z) = (1 + z 2 )17 = ∞∑ n=0 pnzn of a discrete probability distribution pn. (a) Show that pn is normalised and calculate the probabilities for n = 0 and for n = 18. [5] (b) Write down the deﬁnitions for the mean µ and the variance σ2 of the distribution pn and calculate them using the generating function above. [5] 6. A one-dimensional quantum mechanical wavefunction is ψ(x) = C (1 − x2 b2 ) , where the particle is restricted to the region x ∈ [−b, b] and C is the (real) normalisation constant. Find the normalisation constant C and calculate the uncertainty in position ∆x = √ ⟨x2⟩ − ⟨x⟩2 of the particle.

(a) Give a deﬁnition of proper time. [3] (b) Twin A ﬂies with a constant velocity V = 3c/5 away from twin B who stays on Earth. According to the twin A’s clock he travels for 10 years before deciding to return back to Earth. What is the distance (in light years, 1 light year= c×year) he travelled measured in the Earth’s frame of reference? [4] (c) Draw the world line of the twin A on a Minkowski diagram with axes x and t of the Earth reference frame Σ. Indicate the event just before the U-turn and draw the line x = ct. [3] (d) The journey started on the 14th birthday of the twins, so the decision to return comes on the 24th birthday of twin A (according to his own clock). Just before the U-turn, he receives a video call with congratulations from his Earth sibling (who is an expert in Special Relativity and sent his video message so it would reach the spaceship just in time). How old does the Earth brother appear on this video call? [Hint: Use the space-time interval ∆s2 = 0 between events on the light-cone]. [10] (e) Twin A decides to hurry up and rushes back to Earth with velocity V ′ = 3c/4. How old is each twin when they ﬁnally meet? [Hint: use √7 ≃ 2.6]. [10] A22622 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 8. (a) Deﬁne probability density p(x) of a random variable a < x < b and explain how to normalise it. [4] (b) If the random variable x is mapped onto y using the monotonically increasing function y(x) show the following relation between their probability densities, P (y) = p(x)dx dy , for y(a) < y < y(b) . [5] (c) A source produces relativistic particles of (rest) mass m with energy E distributed according to probability density P (E) = A E3 , E0 < E . State the minimal possible value of E0 and ﬁnd the constant A. [5] (d) Calculate the mean energy ¯E of the produced particles. [3] (e) State the relation E(v) between the energy of a relativistic particle and its speed v. Particles are moving in the same direction and v > 0. Find the probability density p(v). [8] (f) Calculate the mean speed ¯v and state whether ¯E = E(¯v). [5] A22622 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 9. An arrow is being shot at a target on a wall. The distribution of horizontal and vertical deviations x and y are identical normal distributions p(x) = √Ce−x2/2σ2 , p(y) = √Ce−y2/2σ2 , where C, σ are some constants. (a) The vertical and horizontal deviations of the arrow are independent, calculate the joint probability distribution p(x, y) of the coordinates of the arrow and state the probability for the arrow to hit a small area a situated near the point (x, y). [3] (b) In terms of polar coordinates (ρ, θ) x = ρ cos θ , y = ρ sin θ . Calculate the area element subtended by small intervals dρ, dθ around the point (ρ, θ) and state the probability density P (ρ, θ) in polar coordinates. [9] (c) Normalise the probability density P (ρ, θ), i.e. ﬁnd the value of C [8] (d) Find the probability Pn to shoot the arrow in the annular region σ√n − 1 < ρ < σ√n , n = 1, 2, . . . . and ﬁnd the mean value ⟨n⟩ and the variance ∆n2 = ⟨n2⟩ − ⟨n⟩2.
