The 1-cycles satisfy x = a − x2 ⇒ ( x + 1 and then we can construct a quadratic equation with these points as solutions (z − x)(z − y) = z2 − z(x + y) + xy = z2 − z + 1 − a = ( z − 1 The third equation can be obtained by taking the diﬀerence between neighbouring equations z − y = x2 − y2 x − z = y2 − z2 y − x = z2 − x2 producting them together and assuming that there is no 1-cycle (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = −1 ⇒ b1b2 − b3 = −1 We can then eliminate b3 using the third equation, eliminate b2 using the ﬁrst equation to get a cubic equation for b1 ( b1 + 3 which bracket the solution. 7∗. Find all the 4-cycles for the map xn+1 = a − x2 n Answer 7. To ﬁnd the 4-cycles we need to solve the equations y = a − x2 z = a − y2 w = a − z2 x = a − w2 Taking the diﬀerence of the ﬁrst and third equations and then the diﬀerence of the second and fourth equations give y − w = z2 − x2 z − x = w2 − y2 and then the product of these two and the assumption that there are no 2-cycles gives (z + x)(y + w) = −1 The sum of the ﬁrst and third equations and then the sum the second and fourth equations gives (y +w) = 2a−x2 −z2 = 2a−(x+z)2 +2xz x+z = 2a−y2 −w2 = 2a−(y +w)2 +2yw which should be considered as equations for the products 2xz = (x + z)2 + (y + w) − 2a 2yw = (y + w)2 + (x + z) − 2a The ﬁnal equation comes from taking the ﬁrst diﬀerence equation times (z − x) and then adding the second diﬀerence equation times (w − y) to give (z−x)2(z+x)+(w−y)2(w+y) = 0 = [(z + x)2 − 4xz] (z+x)+[ (w + y)2 − 4wy] (w+y) and then eliminating the products [ (z + x)2 − 2 ( (x + z)2 + (y + w) − 2a)] (z + x) + [(y + w)2 − 2 ( (y + w)2 + (x + z) − 2a)] (y + w) = 0 which simpliﬁes to (x + z)3 + (y + w)3 = 4a(x + z + y + w) − 4(x + z)(y + w) = 4a(x + z + y + w) + 4 We can also deduce that (x + z + y + w)3 = (x + z)3 + (y + w)3 + 3(x + z)(y + w)(x + z + y + w) = (x + z)3 + (y + w)3 − 3(x + z + y + w) 4 and then we ﬁnd an equation for (x + z + y + w) ≡ b1 b3 1 − (4a − 3)b1 − 4 = 0 We solve this for b1 then we solve (q − x − z)(q − y − w) = q2 − b1q − 1 = 0 to provide x + z and y + w and ﬁnally (p − x)(p − z) = p 2 − (x + z)p + xz = 0 (p − y)(p − w) = p 2 − (y + w)p + yw = 0 to ﬁnd all the points. Note that when a = 5 and then subtracting the last two gives ( 2a − 2 − 2 Solving for xn gives xn = 1 for the origin −1 < df To determine stability we need df the tent map. 13. Consider the map xn+1 = rxn(3 − 4x2 n) Find all the 1-cycles and establish the regions of control parameter for which they are stable. Find all the 2-cycles and establish the regions of control parameter for which they are stable. Employ xn = sin πyn (z ± ∆which depicts as -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Map xM(x) 14. Consider the mapping xn+1 = rxn(x2 n − 1) where r is a control parameter. Employ the transformation xn = 2 = cos 3 x + 3i cos 2 x sin x − 3 cos x sin 2 x − i sin 3 x from which cos 3x = cos 3 x − 3 cos x sin 2 x = 4 cos 3 x − 3 cos x The special value of control parameter is r=3 and with the help of cos πyn+1 = cos 3πyn = cos(2π − 3πyn) = cos(3πyn − 2π) We can deduce that M [y] =3y y ∈ [0, 1 For the 2-cycles we have z = 3y y = 3z ⇒ y = z = 0 z = 2 − 3y y = 2 − 3z ⇒ y = z = 1 Adding gives (y + x) [ 1 Answer 16. We can depict the map M [x] -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Map xM(x) and then since each third maps onto the whole region we get three copies of the original map. Since this map is anti-symmetric, when we map from one down to minus one, we get the map reversed. This gives us two copies of the reversed map at the edges and one copy in the middle. Similar arguments work for all multiple maps. The map M (2)[x] 16 depicts as -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Map xM(x) and the map M (3)[x] as -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Map xM(x) 17 The number of solutions to x = M (N)[x] is clearly 3N . We can readily count the n-cycles using the idea that all previous cycles with factors that divide n are also encountered n=1 ⇒ 3×1-cycles n=2 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 3×2-cycles n=3 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 8×3-cycles n=4 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 3×2-cycles 18×4-cycles n=5 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 48×5-cycles n=6 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 3×2-cycles 8×3-cycles 116×6-cycles n=7 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 312×7-cycles n=8 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 3×2-cycles 18×4-cycles 810×8-cycles n=9 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 8×3-cycles 2184×9-cycles n=10 ⇒ 3×1-cycles 3×2-cycles 48×5-cycles 5880×10-cycles 17. Consider the map xn+1 = rxn [ 1 − x2 n + x4 n whilst when S=-1 we ﬁnd 4r2 + 8r − 36 = 4(r2 + 2r − 9) = 0 ⇒ r = −1 ± √10 Substituting in the transformation gives 2 sin πyn+1 which depicts as -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 -1.00 -0.75 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Map xM(x) 18∗.
