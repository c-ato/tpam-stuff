A series of bright and dark rings is observed on a screen behind the sample. [The mass of the electron is 9.109 x 10 -31 kg.] a) Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the incident electrons. [2 marks] b) Draw a sketch to illustrate how the scattering angle, 𝜙, is related to the Bragg angle, 𝜃. [2 marks] c) Hence, write down an expression for the spacing of the planes of the crystal as a function of the scattering angle, 𝜙. [2 marks] d) If bright rings are observed at angles of 𝜙 = 20 o and 40.7 o to the beam direction, calculate the spacing of the planes of the crystal. [3 marks] e) What photon energy would be required to produce the same diffraction pattern? [1 mark]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
