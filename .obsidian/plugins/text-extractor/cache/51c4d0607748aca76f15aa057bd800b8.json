Inconsistent notations and incoherent or incomplete reasoning will be penalised. When using a theorem or general result from the lecture notes, state the result, instead of quoting the theorem number. 1. Consider the vector space R3 and u1 = (2, −1, 0) ∈ R3, u2 = (0, −1, 2) ∈ R3, U = {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ R 3 : 3x1 + 2x2 + x3 = 0} ≤ R 3. (a) Show that span{u1, u2} is the plane through the origin with normal vector (1, 2, 1). (b) Find a spanning set for U . 2. Let M22(R) be the vector space of 2 × 2 real matrices, with the standard matrix addition and scalar multiplication. Let A = ( 1 0 1 1 ) , B = ( 1 1 0 1 ) , C = ( 1 1 1 0 ) . Show that {A, B, C} is a linearly independent set. 3. Let P2(R) be the vector space of real polynomials of order at most 2: P2(R) = {a2x2 + a1x + a0 : a0, a1, a2 ∈ R}, with vector addition defined by (a2x2 + a1x + a0) + (b2x2 + b1x + b0) = (a2 + b2)x2 + (a1 + b1)x + (a0 + b0), and scalar multiplication defined for all λ ∈ R by λ(a2x2 + a1x + a0) = λa2x2 + λa1x + λa0. (a) Show that U = {a2x2 + a1x + a0 : a0, a1, a2 ∈ R, a0 + a1 + a2 = 0} is a subspace of P2(R). (b) Show that U = span{x2 − 1, x − 1}. Hence, show that dim(U ) = 2. 4. By finding the rank of a suitably defined matrix, show that the following set of vectors in R4 is linearly independent: U = {(1, 0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1, 0)}. Extend U to a basis B of R4 such that U ⊆ B. 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
