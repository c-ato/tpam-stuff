Probability of energy population Recall that the probability of measuring a given energy state is given by 𝑃𝑟 𝐸𝑖 ∝ ⅇ− 𝐸𝑖 𝑘𝐵𝑇 The non-zero vibrational energy states occur at large energies, and hence for a reasonable probability of the molecule being in that state, we can’t have 𝑘𝐵𝑇 ≪ 𝐸𝑖 (as it is at room temperature) Probability of energy population Degrees of freedom can be considered fully “excited” if 𝑘𝐵𝑇 ≫ 𝐸1 − 𝐸0 If 𝑘𝐵𝑇 ≪ 𝐸1 − 𝐸0, the degree of freedom is said to be “frozen out” Will look at the exact behaviour of these breakdowns in the 2nd year course “Quantum Approach to Solids” Example question We have 2 moles of a diatomic gas at a temperature of 20000 K. What is do we expect the internal energy of the gas to be? A: 7𝑅 2 × 20000 × 2 = 1.1 MJ What if instead, the molecules were rigid? A: 5𝑅 2 × 20000 × 2 = 0.83 MJ as no vibrational modes possible","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
