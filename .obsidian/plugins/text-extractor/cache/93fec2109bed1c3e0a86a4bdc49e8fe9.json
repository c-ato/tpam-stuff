[1] (Students may quote this and are not required to derive it and don’t need to include the unit vector. If they don’t write this but still get (1) right they still get this mark) Using the superposition principle: 𝐸 = 𝐸𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒1 + 𝐸𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒2 (1) to the left of the sheets: 𝐸 = [− 3𝜎 2𝜀0 + 𝜎 2𝜀0] 𝑥̂ = −𝜎 𝜀0 𝑥̂ [1 mark] (2) in between the sheets: 𝐸 = [ 3𝜎 2𝜀0 + 𝜎 2𝜀0] 𝑥̂ = 2𝜎 𝜀0 𝑥̂ [1 mark] (3) to the right of the sheets: 𝐸 = [ 3𝜎 2𝜀0 − 𝜎 2𝜀0] 𝑥̂ = 𝜎 𝜀0 𝑥̂ [1 mark] [Q2] Using Gauss’s Law: 𝐸 = ∫ 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐 𝜀0 , where 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐 is the charged enclosed by the Gaussian surface S. By symmetry ∫ 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 𝑆 = ∫ 𝐸 𝑑𝑆 = 𝐸 ∫ 𝑑𝑆 𝑆 = 𝐸 4𝜋𝑟2 𝑆 For r < R 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐 = ∫ 𝜌(𝑟) 𝑑𝑉 = ∫ 𝜌(𝑟) 4𝜋𝑟2𝑑𝑟 = 4𝜋𝜌0 𝑅2 ∫ 𝑟4𝑑𝑟 Hence 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐 = 4𝜋𝜌0 𝑅2 𝑟5 5 Putting the above into Gauss’s Law: 𝐸 4𝜋𝑟2 = 4𝜋𝜌0 𝜀0𝑅2 𝑟5 5 → 𝐸 = 𝜌0𝑟3 5𝜀0𝑅2 (inside) [2 marks] For r > R 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐 = 4𝜋𝜌0 𝑅2 ∫ 𝑟4𝑑𝑟 𝑅 0 = 4𝜋𝜌0 𝑅2 𝑅5 5 = 4𝜋𝜌0 5 𝑅3 r R Hence, putting the above into Gauss’s Law: 𝐸 4𝜋𝑟2 = 4𝜋𝜌0 5𝜀0 𝑅3 → 𝐸 = 𝜌0𝑅3 5𝜀0𝑟2 (outside) [1 mark] [Q3] The simplest way to solve this problem is to see that the sphere with a cavity is equivalent to a solid sphere S1 centred at the origin superimposed with a sphere S2 with negative charge density -, centred at a. For sphere S1 with no cavity, from Gauss’s Law: 𝐸 4𝜋𝑟2 = 1 𝜀0 𝜌 4𝜋 3 𝑟3 → 𝐸 = 𝜌 3𝜀0 𝑟 [1 mark] The field is radial everywhere and outwards because the charge is positive. Now, let’s introduce a sphere S2 with negative charge density. The E-field due to the sphere S1 with positive charge density is: 𝐸1 = 𝜌 3𝜀0 𝑟1 (from above) field due to S1 The E-field due to the sphere S2, with negative charge density, in terms of the vector r2 from the centre of S2 is: 𝐸2 = −𝜌 3𝜀0 𝑟2 field due to S2 The total field inside the cavity is hence the vector sum of the E1 and E2 i.e. 𝐸𝑐 = 𝜌 3𝜀0 (𝑟1 − 𝑟2) = 𝜌 3𝜀0 𝑎 [3 marks] [Note to markers: If the reasoning is correct, but there is an algebraic (not conceptual) error, in the calculation, subtract 1 mark.] r2 r1 a","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
