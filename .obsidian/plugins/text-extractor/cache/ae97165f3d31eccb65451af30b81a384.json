Introduction to Probability Continuous Random Walk Introduction to Probability 𝑥𝑡 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑥𝑡−1 𝑦𝑡−1 + cos 𝜃 sin 𝜃 What is the probability it lands exactly on (𝜋, 𝜋)? What is the probability it lands near (𝜋, 𝜋)? Continuous Probability (1) Continuous Probability allows the possible values to be real numbers. Instead we have the real numbers (or a subset) for the sample space Ω. We ask: “what is the probability that 𝑥 lies in an interval?”. Introduction to Probability Prob a ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏 = ෍ 𝑎≤𝑥≤𝑏 𝑃(𝑥) → න 𝑎 𝑏 𝑑𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) Continuous Probability (2) We can speak of the probability for an interval of values, but no particular value itself. Introduction to Probability Prob(a ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑎 𝑥=𝑎 ) = න 𝑎 𝑎 𝑑𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) = 0 But 𝑃(𝑎) itself may not be zero We always need a window 𝑃 𝑥 𝑑𝑥 Probability Density Function We call 𝑃 𝑥 the Probability Density Function (PDF). Introduction to Probability 𝑃 𝑥 ≥ 0 1 = න Ω 𝑃 𝑥 𝑑𝑥 But 𝑃 𝑥 itself may be larger than 1. Formulae Replace Σ with ∫ All the old formulae hold!
