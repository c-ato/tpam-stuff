Using simple models to deduce microscopic quantities from macroscopic ones (e.g. the calculation of the size of atoms in next section). Or vice versa. 2. Setting up thermodynamics at the level of the zeroth and ﬁrst laws (second and third next year). This is all about relationships between macroscopic variables – eg the pressure, p, volume, V , and temperature, T , of a gas with no microscopic information needed. And towards the end of the module, we will make contact with some microscopic foundations for thermodynamics. 1.1 Phases of matter The phases of water are very familiar: water, steam and ice. The everyday experience of steam being \"hot\" and ice \"cold\" can be quantitatively represented in the phase diagram of water Fig. (1.1) Figure 1.1: Left: A conventional phase diagram of water; Right: with a logarithmic pressure scale. Consider the left hand ﬁgure in Fig. (1.1). Atmospheric pressure is 10 5 Pa. If one follows the horizontal line corresponding to that pressure you see the conventional ordering with respect to temperature of ice then water then steam, with the boundaries between the phases at the familiar temperatures: 0 ◦C and 100 ◦C. Away from atmospheric pressure some less familiar phenomena are represented. 1 INTRODUCTION 2 Below pressures of 0.6 kPa, we see there is no liquid phase: upon heating ice it transforms (\"sublimates\") into steam directly. (This happens with CO2 at atmospheric pressure, hence the name \"dry ice\" see the phase diagram of CO2, A.S. Witkowski et al Arch. Therm. 35, 117 (2014). And the solid-liquid boundary moves to lower temperatures as pressure is increased away from atmospheric pressure. This may be one reason why ice-skates work – by melting the ice underneath them by pressure forming a lubricating ﬁlm. (A analysis is in Why is Ice slippery?, Physics today, 58, 50, (2005). Ice is unusual in this attribute, most melting curves, pm(T ), have a positive gradient, related to the density of ice being lower than water (if this were not true the Titanic would still be aﬂoat). In the right hand ﬁgure in Fig. (1.1) the many diﬀerent phases of ice (due to diﬀerent crystal structures) at elevated pressures are missing. They may be seen in this ﬁgure, where they are denoted by upper case roman numerals. Terrestrial ice sheets are not thick enough (at least currently) to reach the \"next\" phase of ice, Ice IX. The pressure at the bottom of the deepest (5 km) Antarctic ice sheet is around 500 Atm or 5 × 10 7 Pa. Figure 1.2: Left: a diamond anvil cell (credit: Carleton College) ; right: the National Ignition Facility target (credit: NIF). The pressure in the logarithmic, righthand ﬁgure Fig. (1.1), goes up to 1 TPa ≃ 10 7 Atm. This is not relevant for ice on Earth, but is relevant for other materials in geophysics and astrophysics. Examples being: the pressure at the centre of the Earth is around 0.365 TPa; and at the centre of Jupiter and Saturn is around 5 TPa; and the centre of the Sun is beleived to be around 26 PPa (petaPascal) ≃ 26 × 10 10 Atm. The centre of Jupiter has a mysteriously small core, only discovered recently. The high pressure \"frontier\" in small laboratory experiments is around a TPa, so approaching the pressure of the centres of the giant planets. The small and more delicately controlled environment of a diamond anvil cell (left hand ﬁgure in Fig. (1.2)), where two diamonds are pushed together with the sample in between, can achieve 400 GPa, with a new design 1 INTRODUCTION 3 approaching 1 TPa. For higher pressures, the much larger National Ignition Facility (see the righthand ﬁgure in Fig. (1.2)) in the California will provide pressures up to 10 4 TPa, and hence laboratory astrophysics. This works by providing pressure from 192 (very large) lasers focused on the same point. Finally maybe it is worth noting that atmospheric pressure, 10 5 Pa, is not that small. Compare it with the pressure under a skate supporting a 50 kg person. Let us assume the skate has a width 1 cm and a length 20 cm. Then the total surface area of two such skates is 40 cm 2, and the pressure is p = 50 × g 4 × 10−3 N m−2 = 1.25 × 10 5 Pa , which is roughly atmospheric pressure, but one would not wish to place one’s ﬁnger under the skate! 1.2 Not all phases are gases, liquids and solids We experience one everyday: the Sun. Although the Sun is gaseous, all the atoms except in its outer regions are ionised. Thus it is an electrically conducting gas, a plasma. In many situations one may regard the conductivity as being very high, or inﬁnite, and that aspect is a contributory ingredient in the formation of sun spots and the precursors of coronal mass ejections. Some other phases are due to quantum mechanics. The superﬂuid phase of helium is a quantum liquid, and the ultracold gases which exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation into a single quantum state are quantum gases, with many phenomena distinct to the familiar classical ones. And there are transitions associated with the electrons in solid: magnetism (of which the mag- netism in a bar magnet is the simplest of many possibilities), superconductivity and stranger things – charge- and spin-density waves ... Even under ambient conditions, there are anomalies. A familiar one is that there are allotropes of elemental carbon: it may be diamond or graphite (or nanotubes or buckyballs of C60). Diamond is one of the hardest substances known, but graphite shears very easily (why one can make pencils with it) Fig. (1.3). The other physical properties of these are also very diﬀerent: diamond is a very bad electrical conductor (but the best thermal conductor), graphite conducts, but is very anisotropic because of its layered crystal structure, with a solitary layer being graphene. Less familiar is that there two types of liquid Sulphur – one is a liquid of rings the other being 1 INTRODUCTION 4 discussed in a subsequent rheometric study of the inﬂuence of H2Ssolubility. B. Newtonian viscosity of liquid elemental sulfur in the low-shear region To obtain the Newtonian viscosity of molten sulfur at each temperature, only the viscosity data below the _ccr at each T were averaged and reported in Table II. Note that the shear effect on the viscosity of molten sulfur was not taken into consideration with previous studies, but those studies are assumed to be at very low shear [4–6]. Again, only the heating runs were reported. These data were plotted in Fig. 4 along with sulfur viscosity models that will be discussed below. Figure 4 shows a good agreement with the previous published data, where the previous studies were performed at low shear rates. Pure sulfur is a mixture of sulfur rings (Sn with n ¼ 6 to 35) and free polymeric diradical chains (helical in nature). As the bulk liquid temperature rises, the mass fraction of polymeric chains increases; however, the average chain length decreases [22,23]. The dynamic destruction of monomers and chains, concatenation, and entanglement is termed a living polymer system and has prompted the development of several models, including the monomer-mediated, scission-recombination, and activated-association models. Alternatively, several applied programs use the empirical equations of Shuai and Meisen, which have no physical basis and are not continuous over the transition region [24]. In order to provide a closed- form equation for calculating the low-shear viscosity, we have calibrated a semiempirical equation, which resembles the scission-recombination model of Cates [8]. Earlier modelling efforts based on molecular ﬂow alone had either under- or overestimated the viscosity of sulfur at temperatures above its k-transition. Eisenberg suggested that an additional mecha- nism of relaxation was required to accurately model sulfur’s viscosity [25]. Although he developed further equations based on bond interchange and chain-end interchange theories, both under-predicted g of sulfur by 4 orders of magnitude. Cates incorporated bond breaking into reptation theory, which he combined with the existing sulfur polymer equilibria theories established by earlier authors to model the viscosity of sulfur [8]. A comparison between different physical models has been provided by Stukalin and Freed, who have further developed a monomer-mediated model with fewer assumptions than that of Cates [26]. Stukalin and Freed [26] provide a much more complete description of the scission-recombination model and its limits, which are not part of the scope of this study. Reptation is the thermal motion of long linear entangled polymers in polymer melts or concentrated polymers, analo- gous to snakes slithering through one another [27]. A poly- mer chain is restricted to motion along a tube of entanglements made by other polymers. By exiting the tube in a snakelike diffusion, relaxation takes place on a time scale known as reptation time (srep). sbreak represents the time taken for a chain of polymerization index N, to break TABLE II. Experimental measurements of average Newtonian g and _ccr from 120 to 280 \"C. The stated uncertainties in g, d, are estimated using the standard deviation and a 95.5% conﬁdence interval, while the uncertainties in T were estimated to be 6 0.1 \"C for the entire set of measurements.

Similar transitions occur in other elemental liquids at high pressure, eg Phosphorus (Y. Katayama et al . Nature, 403, 170 (2000). Liquid crystals sounds like an oxymoron, but they are made of molecules and not atoms. The molecules orient in the same direction (\"crystalline\") although the molecular centres of mass remain disordered and \"liquid\". The simplest type are nematics, but there are more exotic varieties. They are used in soap, bullet proof vests and puncture-proof bicycle tyres (kevlar is a liquid crystal polymer) and television screens. The last two classes of examples are really just adding extra variables to a liquid phase. Worse things can happen – one cannot ﬁnd an appropriate label for a \"phase\". Dry sand is an example – it can ﬂow like a liquid (eg egg-timer), but not quite like a liquid. It ﬂows at same rate independent of the amount of sand in the upper chamber (which is why it is useful as a timer), here is an article on sand ﬂow. A liquid would ﬂow faster if there were a bigger pressure head. On the other hand you can stand on sand – you do not sink more than a few centimetres, unlike a liquid. And the beach is not ﬂat even if there is no wind. Compare the ocean. So it cannot be classiﬁed, although moist sand is more like a normal solid. Quicksand is still more complicated. The ﬂow of sand and other granular media (eg gravel, talcum powder, rice, grain in a silo, avalanches, landslides ...) is still not well understood – even at the level of the equations of 2 BIBLIOGRAPHY 5 motion (let alone their solution). Experiments to understand these media are taking place here in the Positron Emission Centre in the Medical Physics building in collaboration with the chemical engineers. 2 Bibliography The books which are closest to the level of the module in the properties of matter treatment are: Properties of matter B.
