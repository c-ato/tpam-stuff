The coeﬃcient of kinetic friction is µk = 0.3. 1. With how much force do I need to pull the block horizontally in order to keep it moving at a constant non-zero velocity? [1 mark] 2. How much work will I need to do in order to move the block by 10 m in a straight horizontal line, while pulling horizontally and moving the block at a constant velocity? [2 marks] 3. At what angle θ from the horizontal should I pull the block in order to minimise the total work I need to do in order to move the block by 10 m in a straight horizontal line at a constant non-zero velocity, and what will that work be? [7 marks] Quantum Mechanics 1 – Problem 6 olybdenum is commonly used as a target material in commercial X-ray tubes. The average ionisation energies of the K, L and M electron shells in molybdenum are 20,002 eV, 2,573 eV, and 284 eV, respectively. If electrons are accelerated toward the target through a potential difference of 35 kV, what is the cutoff wavelength in the Bremsstrahlung spectrum? [2 marks] b) Use the data provided to calculate the wavelengths of any discrete lines that may appear in the spectrum. [3 marks] Use the information gathered in parts (a) and (b) to draw a reasonably accurate diagram of the wavelength spectrum of X-rays that will be produced in a 35 kV molybdenum X-ray tube. Label the key features in the spectrum. [3 marks] How would the X-ray spectrum change if the acceleration potential difference is lowered to 19.8 kV? [2 marks] Optics and Waves (Week 7) (a) An airplane is flying at a constant altitude at a steady speed u which is greater than the speed of sound. At one instant in time, the shock wave arrives at point B. In the diagram below,  is the Mach cone angle. For the moment an observer at point B heard the sonic boom, what did observers at A, C and D hear? Explain your reasoning. Just in case that you get worried about the observer at point D, I can assure you that the observer at point can move out of the way with super-supersonic speed and hence would not cause unnecessary damage to the airplane due to a potential head-on collision. [4] (b) Two train whistles, A and B, each has a frequency of 390 Hz. A is stationary and B is moving away towards the right at a speed of 40.0 m/s. An athlete is running after train B at a speed of 14.0 m/s. What is the frequency from A heard by the athlete? What is the frequency from B heard by the athlete? (Speed of sound in air is 340m s-1) [4] The athlete also hears an echo of whistle A from the back of train B. What frequency is this echo?
