Working in SI units, 𝜆 = ℎ √2𝑚𝐸 = 6.626 × 10123 √2 × 9.109 × 10125 × 50 × 1.6 × 10157 = 1.74 × 1015:m. [2 marks] b) The Bragg conditions for constructive interference from crystal planes within the sample are 2𝑑\t sin 𝜃 \t = \t𝑛𝜆 and 𝜃CD = 𝜃EFG. The angle 𝜙 between the beam direction and the fringe position is not the angle 𝜃 in the Bragg formula. As shown in the figure, 𝜙 = \t2𝜃. [2 marks] c) From the Bragg formula, the diffraction maxima occur at angles satisfying 2𝑑\t𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜙 2⁄ ) = 𝑛𝜆. Rearranging, the plane spacing is 𝑑 = 𝑛𝜆 2\t𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜙 2⁄ ). [2 marks] d) Some judgment is needed here. The smaller angle will correspond to the lowest order diffraction, 𝑛. Taking the smaller angle (𝜙\t = 20°) to be the first diffraction maximum (𝑛 = 1), the plane spacing is 𝑑 = 𝑛𝜆 2\t𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜙 2⁄ ) = 1.74 × 1015: 2\tsin\t(10O) = 5.0 × 1015:m. [2 marks] This assumption should be confirmed by using 𝑛 = 2 for the second peak. 𝑑 = 𝑛𝜆 2\t𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜙 2⁄ ) = 2 × 1.74 × 1015: 2\tsin\t(20.35O) = 5.0 × 1015:m. [1 mark] e) A photon of the same wavelength would have an energy 𝐸 = ℎ𝑐/𝜆 = 7.1\tkeV\t(1.1 × 1015VJ). Note that this is a very different energy. [1 mark]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
