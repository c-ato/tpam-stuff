At equilibrium, the forces on the two masses (tension T , electrostatic force F and gravitational force mg) are the same. Hence by symmetry the angles θ1 and θ2 are the same. Answer (a): θ1 = θ2 = θ. [1] Any sensible justiﬁcation is ﬁne i.e. both electrostatic and grav- itation forces are the same on each ball. 1.1.b The distance between the spheres is: r = 2l sin θ where θ = θ1 = θ2 So the elctrostatic force between the balls is: F = 1 4πϵ0 q2 r2 = 1 16πϵ0 q2 l2 sin 2 θ The horizontal force due to the tension is F = T sin θ but the vertical force due to tension is T cos θ = mg Hence, the gravitational force on each sphere in the horizontal direction is F = mg tan θ Equating gravitational and electrostatic forces gives: F = 1 16πϵ0 q2 l2 sin 2 θ = F = mg tan θ As long as they get this expression they get the 1 mark Hence: sin 2 θ tan θ = 1 16πϵ0 q2 mgl2 [1] 1.2.a We now replace the sphere on the right hand side with a sphere twice as heavy. The diagramme on the right shown the forces on the two masses. [1] As long as the diagram looks something like this, give them the 1 mark. 1.2.b The electrostatic force between the spheres remains the same but the gravitational force on the right sphere has increased. Hence the horzontal component would increase until the angle decreases to balance the foces. So, at equilibrium: θ1 > θ2 The answer is (b) [1] Any sensible justiﬁcation will do. Problem 2. Let’s deﬁne k = 1 4πϵ0 (just to avoid having to keep writing it) The students don’t need to deﬁne k. Considering point A. The electric ﬁeld is radial from each charge, and therefore the x component is Ex(A) = 0 [1] The y component is: Ey(A) = kq (r − a)2 − 2 kq r2 + kq (r + a)2 [1] = kq r2 [ 1 (1 − a r )2 − 2 + 1 (1 + a r )2 ] We now expand in terms of a r and keep only the leading order term: Ey(A) = kq r2 [ (1 + 2 a r + 3 a2 r2 ) − 2 + (1 − 2 a r + 3 a 2 r2 ) ] + O( a 3 r3 ) ≈ kq r2 (6 a 2 r2 ) = 3q 2πϵ0 ( a2 r4 ) [1] Provided students get the right answer, they get the marks Considering now point B. E from the negative charges is along the x axis. Based on symmetry, the y components of the ﬁeld from the positive charges are equal and opposite, and therefore cancel. Therefore the y component of the ﬁeld is: Ey(B) = 0 [1] The x component is now: Ex(B) = 2kq (r2 + a2) cos θ − 2kq r2 [1] = 2kq (r2 + a2) r (r2 + a2)1/2 − 2kq r2 = 2kq r (r2 + a2)3/2 − 2kq r2 = 2kq r r3(1 + a2 r2 )3/2 − 2kq r2 = 2kq r2 [ (1 + a 2 r2 ) −3/2 − 1 ] = 2kq r2 [ (1 − 3 2 a 2 r2 − 1 ] + O( a 4 r4 ) ≈ 2kq r2 (− 3 2 a 2 r2 ) = − 3q 4πϵ0 ( a 2 r4 ) [1] Provided students get the right answer, they get the marks","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
