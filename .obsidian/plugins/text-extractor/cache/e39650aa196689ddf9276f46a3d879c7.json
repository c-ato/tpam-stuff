Let f : (−∞, α) → R for some α ∈ R. Define what is meant by lim x→−∞ f (x) = A for A ∈ R. Prove lim x→−∞ 1 x = 0 by using this definition. Solution. Suppose that the domain of a real function f contains (−∞, α) for some α ∈ R and A ∈ R. If for all ε > 0, there exists K < α, such that |f (x) − A| < ε ∀ x < K, then we say the limit of f , as x tends to −∞, is A. In this case we write f (x) → A as x → −∞, or lim x→−∞ f (x) = A. Now we prove the limit lim x→−∞ 1 x = 0. We first note that the function f (x) = 1/x is defined on (−∞, 0). For any ε > 0, let K = − 1 ε . Then we have |1/x − 0| = 1/|x| < 1/|K| = ε for all x < −K (or |x| > |K|). Thus, we prove the limit lim x→−∞ 1 x = 0. □ Q2. Determine the limit lim x→−3 3x and prove that your answer is correct by directly appealing to the definition of the limit. Solution. The limit is −9, i.e. lim x→−3 3x = −9. Now, we prove it. Given ε > 0, we take δ = ε 3 . Then for all 0 < |x + 3| < δ, we have |3x − (−9)| = 3|x + 3| < 3δ = ε. Therefore, |3x − (−9)| < ε whenever 0 < |x + 3| < δ. Thus, we finish the proof. □ Q3. Show that lim x→8 x2 = 64, by using the definition of limit. Solution. Let ε > 0. We want to show that there exists δ > 0, such that whenever 0 < |x − 8| < δ, we have |x2 − 64| < ε . Note that |x2 − 64| = |x − 8||x + 8|, if we require δ ≤ 1, we obtain that |x − 8| < 1 which implies that |x| < 9 and hence |x + 8| < 17. Thus, if 17|x − 8| < ε , then, |x2 − 64| < 17|x − 8| < ε. Thus, we require δ ≤ ε 17 and δ ≤ 1. The choice δ = min { ε 17 , 1 } is sufficient. Therefore, by Definition, lim x→8 x2 = 64, as required. □ Q4. Make minor adaptations to the proof of Theorem 2.6 to prove the following theorem. 1 2 Theorem 1 (Squeeze). Suppose that f , g and h are real functions, and that for some α > 0, (1) f (x) ≤ h(x) ≤ g(x) for all x ∈ (α, ∞), and that for some A ∈ R, lim x→∞ f (x) = lim x→∞ g(x) = A. Then lim x→∞ h(x) = A. Solution. Let ε > 0. By Definition 2.14 and lim x→∞ f (x) = A, there exists K1 > α, such that (2) |f (x) − A| < ε ∀ x > K1. Similarly, lim x→∞ g(x) = A means that there exists K2 > α such that (3) |g(x) − A| < ε ∀ x > K2. Set K = max{K1, K2}. Then whenever x > K, via (2) and (3), we have, (4) A − ε < f (x) and g(x) < A + ε. It follows from (1) and (4) that whenever x > K, we have A − ε < f (x) ≤ h(x) ≤ g(x) < A + ε. Therefore via Definition 2.14, we conclude that lim x→∞ h(x) = A, as required. □ Q5. Let f, g : R → R. For each of the following statements, either prove it is true using the definition of the limit or give a counterexample to show that it is false. (a) Suppose that lim x→∞ f (x) = a and lim x→∞ g(x) = b. If f (x) < g(x) for all x ∈ R, then a < b. (b) If lim x→a f (x) = ℓ and lim x→a g(x) = ∞, then lim x→a f (x)g(x) = ∞. (c) If lim x→a− f (x) = lim x→a+ f (x) = ℓ, then f (a) = ℓ. (d) If lim x→b f (x) = c and lim x→a g(x) = b, then lim x→a f (g(x)) = c. Solution. None of these statments are true. (a) Let f (x) = 1/(1 + x2) and g(x) = 2/(1 + x2) for all x ∈ R. Then f (x) < g(x) for all x ∈ R, but f (x) → 0 = a and g(x) → 0 = b as x → ∞. Since a ̸< b we have a counter-example to the statement. (b) Let f (x) = x3, for all x ∈ R, and g(x) = 1/x2 for all x ̸= 0 (with g(0) ∈ R). Then lim x→0 f (x) = 0, lim x→0 g(x) = ∞, but f (x)g(x) = x for all x ̸= 0, so that lim x→0 f (x)g(x) = 0. Since lim x→0 f (x)g(x) ̸= ∞ we have a counter-example to the statement. (c) Let f (x) = {0, if x ̸= 0 1, if x = 0. Then lim x→0− f (x) = lim x→0+ f (x) = 0, but f (0) = 1. Since 0 ̸= 1 we have a counter-example to the statement. 3 (d) Let g(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R and let f (x) = {0, if x ̸= 0. 1, if x = 0. Then lim x→0 f (x) = 0 = c and lim x→0 g(x) = 0 = b. Moreover, since f (g(x)) = 1 for all x ∈ R, it follows that lim x→0 f (g(x) ) = 1. Since 1 ̸= 0 = c we have a counter-example to the statement. □ Q6. Let A ⊆ R. Let f : A → R be continuous. Let a ∈ A. Prove that, if f (a) > 0, then there exists δ > 0 such that f (x) > 0 for all x ∈ A ∩ (a − δ, a + δ). [This is sometimes called the “sign-preserving property” of continuous functions: informally, if a continuous function is positive at a certain point, then it is also positive at nearby points.] Solution. By our assumptions, we know that f is continuous at a, which means, by definition, that (5) ∀ϵ > 0 : ∃δ > 0 : ∀x ∈ A : (|x − a| < δ ⇒ |f (x) − f (a)| < ϵ) . Since we know that f (a) > 0, we can apply (5) with ϵ = f (a) and obtain the corresponding δ > 0. We now notice that, if x ∈ A ∩ (a − δ, a + δ), then x ∈ A and |x − a| < δ, and therefore from (5) we deduce that f (a) − f (x) ≤ |f (x) − f (a)| (by properties of the absolute value) < ϵ (by (5)) = f (a), (by our choice of ϵ) that is, f (a) − f (x) < f (a), which, rearranged, gives f (x) > 0, as desired. □ Q7. Demonstrate (referring to either definitions or theorems) that the following limits do not exist. (a) lim x→∞ cos x. (b) lim x→0 e−1/x. Solution. (a) Consider the sequence {an} given by an = nπ for n ∈ N. Observe that cos an = (−1) n for n ∈ N and lim n→∞(−1)n does not exist. Given that Theorem 2.33 also applies with ∞ replacing x0, it follows from the contraposition of Theorem 2.33 that lim x→∞ cos x does not exist. (b) Let ε ∈ (0, 1). For 0 < x < −1 ln ε it follows that 0 < e −1/x < ε. Hence lim x→0+ e−1/x = 0. For −1 < x < 0 it follows that e−1/x > e and hence lim x→0− e−1/x ̸= 0. Hence, lim x→0 e−1/x does not exist. □ Q8. Determine the value of the following limits. You can use any of the definitions and results discussed in lectures, provided you clearly state what you are using. Only those materials that have been discussed in lectures can be used here. For instance, you can NOT use L’Hospital’s rule here. (i) lim x→1 x2 − 1 2x2 − x − 1 . 4 (ii) lim x→0 (x − 1) 3 + (1 − 3x) x2 + 2x3 . (iii) lim x→1 xn − 1 xm − 1 , where n, m ∈ N. (iv) lim x→4 √1 + 2x − 3 √x − 2 . (v) lim x→0 tan x − sin x x3 . (vi) lim x→∞ x sin 1 x . Solution. (i). Observe that x2 − 1 2x2 − x − 1 = (x − 1)(x + 1) (x − 1)(2x + 1) = x + 1 2x + 1 , then by the Algebra of Limits, we have lim x→1 x2 − 1 2x2 − x − 1 = lim x→1 x + 1 2x + 1 = limx→1 x + 1 2 limx→1 x + 1 = 2 3 . (ii). Note that (x − 1)3 + (1 − 3x) x2 + 2x3 = x3 − 3x2 x2 + 2x3 = x2(x − 3) x2(1 + 2x) = x − 3 1 + 2x . By using the Algebra of Continuous Functions, so lim x→0 (x − 1) 3 + (1 − 3x) x2 + 2x3 lim x→0 x − 3 1 + 2x = −3. (iii). Note that xn − 1 xm − 1 = (x − 1)(xn−1 + xn−2 + · · · + 1) (x − 1)(xm−1 + xm−2 + · · · + 1) = x n−1 + xn−2 + · · · + 1 xm−1 + xm−2 + · · · + 1 , hence, by the Algebra of Limits, lim x→1 xn − 1 xm − 1 = lim x→1 xn−1 + xn−2 + · · · + 1 xm−1 + xm−2 + · · · + 1 = n m . (iv). Note that √1 + 2x − 3 √x − 2 = ( √1 + 2x − 3)( √1 + 2x + 3) (√x − 2)( √1 + 2x + 3) = 2(x − 4) ( √x − 2)( √1 + 2x + 3) = 2(√x + 2) √1 + 2x + 3 , by the Algebra of continuous function, continuity of √x, and continuity of compo- sition of continuous functions, we know that lim x→4 2(√x + 2) √1 + 2x + 3 = 2(limx→4 √x + 2) limx→4 √1 + 2x + 3 = 4 3 . Hence, we have, lim x→4 √1 + 2x − 3 √x − 2 = lim x→4 2(√x + 2) √1 + 2x + 3 = 4 3 . (v). Note that 1 − cos x = 2 sin2 x 2 . 5 Therefore, we have tan x − sin x x3 = (1 − cos x) sin x x3 cos x = 2 sin x sin 2 x 2 x3 cos x = sin x x · sin 2 x 2 ( x 2 )2 · 1 2 cos x By results from lectures (“notable limits”) and algebra of limits, we know that lim x→0 sin x x = 1, lim x→0 sin 2 x 2 ( x 2 )2 = lim x→0 ( sin x 2 x 2 )2 = 1. From algebra of limits and the continuous of cos x, we see that lim x→0 1 2 cos x = 1 2 limx→0 cos x = 1 2 cos 0 = 1 2 . Therefore, we have from the product rule that lim x→0 tan x − sin x x3 = lim x→0 sin x x · sin 2 x 2 ( x 2 )2 · 1 2 cos x = lim x→0 sin x x · lim x→0 sin 2 x 2 ( x 2 )2 · lim x→0 1 2 cos x = 1 2 , (vi). Note that x sin 1 x = sin 1 x 1 x . By setting t = 1 x (“change of variable”), we know that t → 0, as x → ∞. Therefore, we have lim x→∞ x sin 1 x = lim x→∞ sin 1 x 1 x = lim t→0 sin t t = 1, where we used the “notable limit” in the last step. □ Q9. Suppose X ⊂ R and let f : X → R and g : X → R be continuous functions. Define p : X → R by p(x) := max{f (x), g(x)} and q : X → R by q(x) = min{f (x), g(x)}. Prove that p and q are continuous. Solution. Observe that p(x) = 1 2 (f (x) + g(x) + |f (x) − g(x)|) and q(x) = 1 2 (f (x) + g(x) − |f (x) − g(x)|) , for all x ∈ X. Note that h(x) := |x| for all x ∈ R is a continuous function. It follows that p and q are continuous on X, as required. □ Q10. Find an example of a bounded function f : [0, 1] → R that has neither an absolute minimum nor an absolute maximum. Solution. Let f : [0, 1] → R be given by f (x) = { 1 2 , x = {0, 1}, x, x ∈ (0, 1). There exists no local minimum/maximum for f in [0, 1] and hence no absolute maximum/minima for f in [0, 1]. □ 6 Q11. Let f : (0, 1) → R be a continuous function such that lim x→0 f (x) = lim x→1 f (x) = 0. Show that f achieves either an absolute minimum or an absolute maximum on (0, 1) (but perhaps not both). Solution. Define F (x) = { f (x) 0 < x < 1 0 x = 0 or x = 1 . Thus F (x) is continuous on [0, 1] and achieves both absolute max and min. • If max F (x) = M = f (xM ) > 0, then f achieves an absolute max. • If min F (x) = m = f (xm) < 0, then f achieves an absolute min. • If max F (x) = min F (x) = 0, then f is constant, and achieves both max and min. □ Q12. Suppose for f : [0, 1] → R we have |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ K|x − y| for all x, y ∈ [0, 1], and f (0) = f (1) = 0. Prove that |f (x)| ≤ K 2 for all x ∈ [0, 1]. Note: A function f : X → R is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a K > 0 such that |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ K|x − y| ∀ x, y ∈ X. Solution. For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 2 , we have |f (x)| = |f (x) − f (0)| ≤ K|x| ≤ K 2 , Also for 1 2 < x ≤ 1, we have |f (x)| = |f (x) − f (1)| ≤ K|1 − x| ≤ K 2 . Thus, |f (x)| ≤ K 2 for all x ∈ [0, 1], as required. □ Extra Questions EQ1. For each of the following statements, either prove that it is true, or give a coun- terexample to show that it is false. You can use any of the definitions and results discussed in lectures, provided you clearly state what you are using. (i) If f : (0, 1) → R is continuous, then f is bounded. (ii) If g : (0, 1) → R is continuous, then g is differentiable. (iii) If k : [0, 1] → R is differentiable, then k is bounded. Solution. (i). The statement is false. For example, if f : (0, 1) → R is defined by f (x) = 1/x for all x ∈ (0, 1), then f is continuous (by the Algebra of Continuous Functions), but f is unbounded (indeed f ((0, 1)) = (1, ∞), and therefore sup f = ∞). (ii). The statement is false. For example, if g : (0, 1) → R is defined by g(x) = |x − 1/2|, then g is continuous (since x ↦→ |x| is continuous and composition of continuous functions is continuous); however g is not differentiable at 1/2, because, for all h ∈ R \\ {0}, f (1/2 + h) − f (1/2) h = |h| h 7 and the latter expression has no limit as h → 0 (the one-sided limits are ±1). (iii). The statement is true. Indeed, by a result from lectures, if k : [0, 1] → R is differentiable, then k is continuous; moreover, by the Boundedness Theorem, if k : [0, 1] → R is continuous, then it is bounded. □ EQ2. Determine the following limits and prove that your answer is correct by directly appealing to the definition of the limit. (a) lim x→∞ 3x3 − 5x2 − 13 2x3 + 1 . (b) lim x→1+ 2x2 − 3x + 5. (c) lim x→2− 1/(1 − x). (d) lim x→∞(1/x) sin x. Solution. (a) Let f : (0, ∞) → R be given by f (x) = (3x3 − 5x2 − 13)/(2x3 + 1) for all x ∈ (0, ∞). Dividing the top and bottom by x3 we have f (x) = 3x3 − 5x 2 − 13 2x3 + 1 = 3 − 5/x − 13/x3 2 + 1/x3 ∀ x ∈ (0, ∞). Since 5/x, 13/x3 and 1/x3 all tend to 0 as x → ∞, we see that f (x) = 3x3 − 5x2 − 13 2x3 + 1 → 3 − 0 − 0 2 − 0 = 3 2 as x → ∞. We now prove that this is the limit. Let ε > 0. Then ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣f (x) − 3 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ −10x2 + 14x − 29 4x3 + 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ | − 10x2 + 14x − 29| |4x3 + 2| ≤ |10x 2| + |14x2| + |29x2| |4x3| = 53 4x (6) for all x ≥ 1. Let M = max{1, 53 4ε }. Then via (6), it follows that ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣f (x) − 3 2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ 53 4x < ε ∀ x > M. We conclude that lim x→∞ 3x3 − 5x2 − 13 2x3 + 1 = 3 2 , as required. (b) Let f : R → R be given by f (x) = 2x2 − 3x + 5 for all x ∈ R. As x → 1 +, it follows that f (x) = 2x2 − 3x + 5 → 2.11 − 3.1 + 5 = 4. We now prove this. Let ε > 0. Observe that |f (x) − 4| = |2x2 − 3x + 5 − 4| = |2x2 − 3x + 1| = |(2x − 1)(x − 1)| = |2x − 1||x − 1|(7) 8 for all x ∈ R. We are interested in the limit as x → 1+, so we can simply consider 1 < x < 2 in (7). It follows from (7) that (8) |f (x) − 4| = |2x − 1||x − 1| < 3|x − 1| ∀ x ∈ (1, 2). By setting δ = ε 3 it follows from (8) that |f (x) − 4| < |x − 1| < ε ∀ x ∈ (1, 1 + δ). We conclude that lim x→1+ 2x2 − 3x + 5 = 4, as required. (c) Let f : R \\ {1} → R be given by f (x) = 1/(1 − x) for all x ∈ R \\ {1}. Observe that f (x) = 1/(1 − x) → 1/(1 − 2) = −1 as x → 2 −. We now prove this. Let ε > 0. Observe that (9) |f (x) − (−1)| = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 1 − x + 1∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 2 − x 1 − x ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = |2 − x| |1 − x| . for all x ∈ R \\ {1}. We are interested in the limit as x → 1−, so we can simply consider 3 2 < x < 2 in (9). It follows from (9) that (10) |f (x) − (−1)| = |2 − x| |1 − x| < |2 − x| 1/2 = 2|x − 2| for all x ∈ ( 3 2 , 2). Set δ = min { 1 2 , ε 2 } . Then via (9) |f (x) − (−1)| < 2|x − 2| < ε ∀ x ∈ (2 − δ, 2). It follows that lim x→2− 1/(1 − x) = −1 as required. (d) Let f : R \\ {0} → R be given by f (x) = (1/x) sin x for all x ∈ R \\ {0}. We claim f (x) → 0 as x → ∞. Let ε > 0. Observe that (11) |f (x) − 0| = | sin x| x ≤ 1 x . Set K = 1/ε. Then via (11), it follows that |f (x) − 0| ≤ 1 x < ε ∀ x ∈ (K, ∞). We conclude that lim x→∞(1/x) sin x = 0, as required. □ EQ3. Prove that the following limits exist and determine their value. You can use any of the definitions and results discussed in lectures, provided you clearly state what you are using. (i) lim x→−∞ 2x2 − 3x + arctan x. (ii) lim x→2 1 1 − x . (iii) lim x→1/2 4x2 − 1 2x − 1 . Solution. (i). We claim that lim x→−∞ 2x2 − 3x + arctan x = ∞. In order to show this, we first observe that arctan x ≤ π/2 for all x ∈ R, whence 2x2 − 3x + arctan x ≥ 2x2 − 3x − π/2. By the Sandwich Theorem for Infinite Limits, it is then enough to prove that lim x→−∞ 2x2 − 3x − π/2 = ∞. On the other hand, 2x2 − 3x − π/2 = x2(2 − 3/x − π/(2x2)). 9 Since lim x→−∞ x = −∞, by repeatedly applying the Algebra of Limits we obtain that lim x→−∞ 1/x = 0, whence lim x→−∞ x2 = (−∞)·(−∞) = ∞, lim x→−∞ 2−3/x−π/(2x2) = 2−3·0−(π/2)·0 2 = 2 and finally lim x→−∞ 2x2 − 3x − π/2 = lim x→−∞ x2(2 − 3/x − π/(2x2)) = ∞ · 2 = ∞. (ii) We claim that lim x→2 1 1 − x = −1. This is an immediate consequence of the Algebra of Limits, since lim x→2 x = 2, whence lim x→2 1 1 − x = 1 1 − 2 = −1. (iii) We claim that lim x→1/2 4x2 − 1 2x − 1 = 2. Indeed, for all x ̸= 1/2, 4x2 − 1 2x − 1 = (2x − 1)(2x + 1) 2x − 1 = 2x + 1; since moreover limx→1/2 x = 1/2, by the Algebra of Limits we deduce that lim x→1/2 4x2 − 1 2x − 1 = lim x→1/2 2x + 1 = 2(1/2) + 1 = 2. □ EQ4. Suppose g(x) is a monic polynomial of even degree d, that is, g(x) = xd + bd−1xd−1 + · · · + b1x + b0 ∀ x ∈ R, for b0, b1, . . . , bd−1 ∈ R. Show that g achieves an absolute minimum on R. Use this to conclude that if f (x) is a polynomial of degree d and f (R) = R, then d is odd. Solution. Note that g(x) ≥|x| d − |bd−1||x| d−1 − · · · − |b0| ≥|x|d − (|bd−1| + · · · |b0|)|x|d−1 for |x| > 1 . Thus we observe that lim x→±∞ g(x) = ∞. By defintion, there exists N > 0 such that g(x) ≥ g(0) for any x ∈ (−∞, −N ) ∪ (N, ∞). Since g is continuous on [−N, N ] then the absolulte minimum of g on [−N, N ] exists and satisfies min y∈R g(y) = min y∈[−N,N ] g(y) ≤ g(0). Thus the absolute minumum of g : R → R exists, as required. If f : R → R is a polynomial of degree d and f (R) = R, then necessarily (from the above result) the degree d must be odd. This follows since if f (x) = d∑ k=0 akxk ∀ x ∈ R was an even degree polynomial of degree d (i.e. ad ̸= 0), then f (x)/ad would be an even degree monic polynomial for which Im(f ) ̸= R, since min x∈Rf (x)/ad exists. □ EQ5. The number x ∈ [0, 1] is called a fixed point of f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] if x = f (x). If f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is continuous, show that f has a fixed point. 10 Solution. Let g : [0, 1] → R be given by g(x) = f (x) − x for all x ∈ [0, 1]. Then g is continuous on [0, 1]. If f (0) = 0 or f (1) = 1, then the conclusion is valid. If f (0) > 0 and f (1) < 1, then g(0) = f (0) > 0 g(1) = f (1) − 1 < 0. From the intermediate value theorem, there exists c ∈ (0, 1) such that g(c) = 0. It follows that f (c) = c, i.e. c is a fixed point of f , as required. . □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
