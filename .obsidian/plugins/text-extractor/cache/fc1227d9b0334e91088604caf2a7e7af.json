When ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 400 nm falls on a certain metal surface, the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectrons is 1.10 eV. What is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons when light of wavelength 300 nm falls on the same surface? [5] 2. A 15 cm long violin string is ﬁxed at both ends and oscillates in its n =1 mode. The speed of waves on the string is 250 ms −1, and the speed of sound in air is 348 ms−1. What are (i) the frequency and (ii) the wavelength of the emitted sound wave? What is the frequency of the sound perceived by a bird ﬂying at 10 ms−1 toward the violin? [5] 3. The wave function of a free particle moving in the negative x-direction is Ψ(x, t)= Ae−i(kx+ωt). Show that the wave function is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator, ˆpx, and identify the corresponding eigenvalue. Explain the physical signiﬁcance of the terms eigenfunction and eigenvalue in quantum mechanics. [5] 4. In a double-slit interference experiment, two slits of negligible width are separated by spacing d. The distance from the slits to the viewing screen is L with L ≫ d. Treating the two slits as two sources of identical in-phase waves of wavelength λ, with the help of a sketch show that, for small angles, the mth bright fringe occurs at position: ym = mλL d ,m =0, ±1, ±2,...

According to Planck’s hypothesis, the average energy of cavity modes in the blackbody spectrum is wavelength dependent and given by hE (λ)i = hc/λ (exp (hc/λkBT ) − 1). Evaluate hE (λ)i in the limits λ ! +1 and λ ! 0. Brieﬂy explain how this behaviour solved the ultraviolet catastrophe problem in classical physics. [You may assume the approximation exp (x) ⇡ 1+ x for small x.] [5] 6. Strings A and B have identical lengths (L) and linear densities (µ), but string B is under greater tension (TB) than string A (TA). Write down expressions for the standing wave frequencies for the two strings. The ﬁgure below shows four situations, (a) through (d), in which standing wave patterns exist on the two strings. In which situation is there the possibility that strings A and B are oscillating at the same frequency? [5] A22500 Page 3 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR SECTION 2 Answer both questions from this Section. Note that each question has two parts, of which only one part should be answered. If you answer both parts, credit will only be given for the best answer. 7. EITHER (Part A) (a) A molybdenum X-ray tube has an operating voltage of 25 keV. Sketch the expected X-ray emission spectrum as a function of wavelength. Label the key features of the spectrum. Where possible, calculate numerical values for the associated wavelengths of those features.Molybdenum has X-ray absorption edges at 20 keV, 2.6 keV and 0.4 keV.] [6] (b) A collimated beam of X-rays from a molybdenum X-ray tube is incident upon a crystal with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm. What is the smallest angle at which you would orientate the crystal with respect to the photon beam direction to preferentially reﬂect molybdenum Kα X-rays? [4] (c) The beam of molybdenum Kα X-rays prepared in part (b) is to be used to investigate photon scattering from a graphite rod. An X-ray detector is to be used to measure the energy of photons scattered through 90 degrees by the rod. Draw a sketch to show the possible arrangement of X-ray source, collimator, crystal, rod and detector, carefully indicating all relevant angles. [4] (d) Photons are observed at two characteristic energies. The lower energy is measured to be at 16.8 ± 0.1 keV. Show that this result is compatible with Compton scattering of molybdenum Kα X-rays off electrons in the graphite rod. [You may use without proof the Compton shift equation.] [6] (e) Calculate the energy of the scattered electrons and their emission angle with respect to the direction of the incoming molybdenum Kα X-ray photons. [You may assume that the electron was initially at rest.] [5] A22500 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 7. OR (Part B) (a) The time-independent Schr ¨odinger equation (TISE) in one dimension is − ~2 2m d2ψ(x) dx2 + V (x)ψ(x)= Eψ(x).

[6] (b) Brieﬂy explain the physical signiﬁcance of the square modulus of the wave function, |ψ (x) |2? [2] (c) A particle of mass, m, and energy, E, moving along the positive x-direction is incident upon a potential step at x =0. The potential function is V (x)= 0 for x< 0 (region 1) and V (x)= V0 for x ≥ 0 (region 2), where V0 > 0 is a positive constant. The general solution of the TISE in region 1 is ψ1(x)= A exp(ik1x)+ B exp(−ik1x). i. Find an expression for the wavenumber, k1, in terms of m and E. [2] ii. Write down an expression for the solution of the TISE in region 2 when E< V0. Where possible, express any new symbols that you introduce in terms of m, E and V0. [3] iii. By applying appropriate boundary conditions at x =0, show that |A|2 = |B|2 when E< V0. Explain the physical signiﬁcance of this result. [5] iv. Now, consider the situation where E> V0. Write down a new expression for the solution of the TISE in region 2? Where possible, express any new symbols that you introduce in terms of m, E and V0. [3] v. Show that B 6=0 in region 1 when E> V0 and provide a physical interpretation of this result. How does this result differ from the classical expectation? [4] A22500 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 8. EITHER (Part A) (a) Two semi-inﬁnite strings of different mass per unit length, µ1 and µ2, are joined at the position x =0. The tension in the strings is T . A wave, given by y = Acos (k1x − ωt), travels along string 1 from left to right. Show that the amplitudes of the reﬂected and transmitted waves, C and B, respectively, are given by: B = 2k1 k1 + k2 A and C = k1 − k2 k1 + k2 A, where k1 and k2 are the wave-numbers for strings 1 and 2, respectively. State the boundary conditions that you used for the derivation. [8] (b) For µ2 =0, the resultant wave on string 1 can be obtained by superposition of the incident and the reﬂected waves. Express the resultant wave in termsA, k1 and ω. Where is the ﬁrst node from x =0? [7] (c) A string of length L is under constant tension T . The density of the string increases gradually from µ1 to µ2 according to the following expression: µ (x)= µ1 + µ2 − µ1 L x. A single wave pulse is generated at x =0 and it travels to x = L. Find an expression for the time taken for the pulse to arrive at x = L in terms of L, T , µ1 and µ2. [10] A22500 Page 6 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 8.
