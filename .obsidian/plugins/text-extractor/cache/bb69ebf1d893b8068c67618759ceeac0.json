Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. Page 1 Turn over Section A 1. (a) Deﬁne what it means for a sequence of real numbers (an) to tend to inﬁnity. Use the deﬁnition to prove that the sequence (an) given by an = n 1 3 tends to inﬁnity. [5] (b) Deﬁne what it means for a sequence of real numbers (an) to converge to a real number ℓ. Use the deﬁnition to prove that the sequence (an) given by an = n2 + 3n + 1 2n2 + n + 2 converges to 1 2 . [6] (c) Which of the following series converge? Justify any assertions that you make. (i) ∞ ∑ n=1 (n + 1 3n )2 (ii) ∞ ∑ n=1 (n + 1 3n )n (iii) ∞ ∑ n=1 3n2 + 5n + 1 4n3 + 8n2 − 1 (iv) ∞ ∑ n=1 2n (n!)2 (2n)! (v) ∞ ∑ n=1(−1) n+1 (√ 2n + 1 − √ 2n − 1 ) [In this question you may appeal to standard limit theorems for sequences and conver- gence tests for series, provided you make it clear that you are doing so.] [14] A34927alt Page 2 Turn over Section B 2. In this question you may use standard results on the convergence of sequences and series, provided you make it clear that you are doing so. (a) A sequence of nonnegative real numbers (an) is deﬁned recursively by an+1 = 1 3 + 2a2 n 3 ; a1 = 0. (i) Using induction, or otherwise, show that (an) is bounded above by 1 2 . (ii) Show that (an) is increasing. (iii) Deduce that (an) converges, and ﬁnd its limit, justifying any assertions that you make. [10] (b) Deﬁne what it means for a series of real numbers ∞ ∑ n=1 an to converge. Use the deﬁnition to show that the series ∞ ∑ n=1 1 n 2 3 does not converge. [5] (c) (i) Prove that a sequence (an) of real numbers converges if and only if the series ∞ ∑ n=1 (an+1 − an) converges. (ii) Suppose that a sequence (an) of real numbers satisﬁes |an+1 − an| ≤ 2 −n for all n ∈ N. Prove that (an) converges. [10] A34927alt Page 3 End of paper","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
