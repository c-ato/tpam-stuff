Question: “Prove that if A is a skew-symmetric matrix in Mnn(R) with n an odd positive integer, then det(A) = 0.” (Recall that A is skew-symmetric if A T = −A.) Answer: “Let A =    0 a b −a 0 c −b −c 0    where a, b, c ∈ R.

Read the question below and then study the given ‘suggested’ answer with a view to deciding if this answer is correct. If you conclude that the ‘suggested’ answer is wrong, then produce a correct answer.

Answer: The statement is true. Let A = ( 1 1 1 2 ) and B = ( 1 3 3 4 ) . 1VGLA: DETERMINANTS PRACTICE QUESTIONS 5 Then det(A) = 2 − 1 = 1, det(B) = 4 − 9 = −5 and hence, det(A) + det(B) = −4. Also A + B = (2 4 4 6 ) =⇒ det(A + B) = 12 − 16 = −4. Hence det(A + B) = det(A) + det(B) for all A, B ∈ M22(R). (C) Question 30.
