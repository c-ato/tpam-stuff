{"path":"Year 1/Formative Problems/Problem sheet/Subjects/EC/ec_na_week3.pdf","text":"Problem 1 This problem is very similar to the problem in the video recordings Week 03b, except that you have to do a little more work at the end to find the required current. I’ve indicated the method you should use. Further problems 2) A battery has an open circuit voltage, V, and an internal resistance, r. When a 5.0 Ohm resistor is connected across the terminals, the current is 0.5 A. When this resistor is replaced by an 11.0 Ohm resistor, the current is 0.25 A. Find, (a) the open-circuit voltage, V, (b) the internal resistance, r. (c) What value of load resistance would yield the most power in the load and (d) what is the maximum power dissipated in the load. (Answers: a) 3V, b) 1 Ohm, c) 1 Ohm, d) 2.25 W.) 3) Determine the Thévenin equivalent circuit for the circuit shown below. If a load of resistance 50 Ohm is connected to the output terminals AB, what is the current in the load? (Answers: VTH = 50 mV, RTH = 83.3 Ohm IL=0.375 mA) 200 Ω 100 Ω A B 1.0 mA 300 Ω","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
