Use standard limit theorems, such as the Algebra of Limits, or the Sandwich The- orem, to show that (i) 1 + n − 2024n2 + n3 3 + 49n2 + 4n3 → 1 4 (ii) 7n4 − 3n2 sin(2n) + n 5n4 + 7n − 4 → 7 5 (iii) n − 1 n2 + 1 + n − 1 n2 + 2 + · · · + n − 1 n2 + n → 1 Q2. Which of the following statements are true? If a statement is true, provide a proof. If it is false, provide a counterexample. (i) If an → ∞ then 1 an → 0. (ii) If an → 0 then 1 an → ∞. (iii) Suppose an → ℓ and bn → m. If an < bn for all n ∈ N then ℓ < m. (iv) If the sequences (an + bn) and (an − bn) both converge, then (an) and (bn) both converge. (v) If the sequences (an + bn) and (anbn) both converge, then (an) and (bn) both converge. Q3. A sequence of positive real numbers (an) is defined recursively by the formula an+1 = 1 5 (a 2 n + 2an + 2), where a1 = 0. (i) Use induction to prove that an ≤ 1 for all n. (ii) Prove that an+2 − an+1 = 1 5 (an+1 + an + 2)(an+1 − an) for all n ∈ N. (iii) Use induction to prove that (an) is increasing. (iv) Deduce that (an) converges, and find its limit, justifying any assertions that you make. Q4. Consider again the sequence defined in Question 3 above.

A sequence of nonnegative real numbers (an) is defined recursively by the formula an+1 = an + 1 an + 2 , where a1 = 0. (i) Show that (an) is bounded above. (ii) Prove that an+2 − an+1 = an+1 − an (an + 2)(an+1 + 2) for all n ∈ N. (iii) Use induction to prove that (an) is increasing. (iv) Use the Monotone Convergence Theorem to show that (an) converges. Find the limit of (an), justifying any assertions that you make. (v) Show further that an+2 − an+1 ≤ 1 4 (an+1 − an) for all n ∈ N. Q6. Returning to Question 5 above, show further that 0 ≤ an+1 − an ≤ c4 −n for all n ∈ N, where c is some positive constant that you should identify. Extra Questions EQ1. Suppose that (an) is a bounded sequence and bn → 0. Prove that anbn → 0. EQ2. Prove that if a sequence (an) converges then an+1 − an → 0. Is the converse of this statement true; i.e. is it true that if an+1 − an → 0 then (an) converges? If it is true, provide a proof. If it is false, provide a counterexample. EQ3. Recall the following theorem: Theorem (Monotone Convergence Theorem). An increasing sequence of real numbers which is bounded above converges. Propose a similar statement involving an increasing sequence which is not bounded above. Can you prove your assertion? EQ4. A sequence (an) is defined recursively by the formula an+1 = 4 + 2a 1/3 n , where a1 = 1. (i) Prove by induction that 1 ≤ an ≤ 8 for all n ∈ N. (ii) Prove that an+1 an ≥ 1 for all n ∈ N. (iii) State a theorem which allows you to conclude that (an) converges. (iv) Find the limit of the sequence (an), justifying any assertions that you make. 3 EQ5. A sequence (an) is defined recursively by the formula an+1 = 1 5 (a 2 n + 6), where a1 = 5/2. (i) Prove that 2 < an < 3 for all n ∈ N. (ii) Prove that (an) is decreasing. (iii) Deduce that (an) converges, and find its limit. Justify any assertions that you make. EQ6. Define what it means for a sequence of real numbers (an) to tend to infinity. Let (an) be the sequence of real numbers defined recursively by an+1 = an + 1 √n + 1 , where a1 = 1. (i) Use induction to prove that an = n∑ k=1 1 √k for all n ∈ N. (ii) Prove that an ≥ √n for all n ∈ N. (iii) Deduce that an → ∞.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
