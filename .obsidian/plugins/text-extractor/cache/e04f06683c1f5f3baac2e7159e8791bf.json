(permanent magnets) • Some appear non-magnetic, but are attracted by a permanent magnet. • Some are non-magnetic whatever. 4 WHY? Magnetism & the Electron Magnetism is intimately linked to the behaviour of electrons in materials Electrons generate magnetism in 3 ways: 1. Magnetism of Moving Charges (for example, electric current) 2. Magnetism of Orbital Motion(each electron is orbiting around the nucleus (classical view)) 3. Magnetism and Intrinsic Spin(electrons have intrinsic magnetic moments) 5 Magnetic Dipole Moment of Electron in Atom 𝜇 = 𝐼 × 𝜋𝑟2 𝐼 = 𝑒 𝑇 = 𝑒𝑣 2𝜋𝑟 ∴ 𝜇 = 𝑒𝑣𝑟 2 But angular moment 𝑳 = 𝒓𝑚𝑒𝒗 6 v L 𝜇 = 𝑒 2𝑚𝑒 𝐿 Magnetic Dipole Moment of Electron in Atom Note:  & L in opposite direction (as current in opposite direction to electron) i.e. 7 v L 𝜇 = 𝑒 2𝑚𝑒 𝐿 𝝁 = − 𝑒 2𝑚𝑒 𝑳In QM L is quantised and fundamental unit is L = ħ Fundamental unit of magnetic moment: 𝜇 = 𝑒ħ 2𝑚𝑒 = 9.27 × 10−24 𝐴𝑚2 𝐽/𝑇 (Bohr Magneton) Magnetism and Spin • The electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment! 8 𝜇𝑠 = 𝜇𝐵 = 𝑒ħ 2𝑚𝑒 Magnetism and Spin • Protons and Neutrons also have an intrinsic magnetic moment! 9 𝜇𝑝 = 𝑒ħ 2𝑚𝑝 𝜇𝑛 = 𝑒ħ 2𝑚𝑛 Approximately 2000 times smaller than the electron spin. Magnetic Materials • Net magnetic moment of an atom is obtained by combining both orbital and spin moments of all the electrons, taking into account the directions of these moments. • (spin of nucleons negligible when considering bulk magnetic properties of matter). • So why are most materials non-magnetic? 10 Magnetic Materials • Each atom contains a number of electrons, each electron contributes a magnetic moment, but the sum of all the electron contributions can be zero because magnetic moment is a vector. • If not zero, then each atom can be treated as a magnetic dipole. • The alignment of the “atomic dipoles” in a solid is important. 11 Difference Cases 12 Magnetic moment of each atom is zero Total moment is zero. Net moment zero Net moment non-zero Types of Magnetism Materials only exhibit “familiar” magnetic effects when: • Atoms contain unpaired electrons AND • Large scale alignment of the dipole moments occurs • Magnetic materials fall into three categories: Paramagnetic, Ferro-magnetic, or Diamagnetic 13 Paramagnetic & Ferromagnetic Materials • Materials with net atomic magnetic moments are paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials. When a magnetic field is applied to such a material, the magnetic dipoles try to line up parallel to the field. • So the field inside these material increases, (which is the reversal of the electric case!) 14 Diamagnetic Materials • Materials which have no net magnetic moment in the absence of applied B-field. When a magnetic field is applied Lorentz force on the orbiting electrons changes the orbit slightly so there is a tiny net magnetic moment opposite to the B-field. So the B-field inside is slightly reduced. These materials are called Diamagnetic. 15 Paramagnetic Materials • Atoms of a paramagnetic material have permanent magnetic dipole moments. • These dipoles are randomly oriented - Magnetic fields average to zero. • In an external field B0, the dipoles tend to align with B0 - Results in an additional magnetic field Bm. • Material with N atoms, max = N. Randomisation of the dipoles orientations by thermal collisions significantly reduces the total dipole moment (total) 16 Thermal Effects on Paramagnetism • Compare: 3 2 𝑘𝑇 with 2𝜇𝐵 • Example: T = 300K, B = 1.5 T and 𝜇 = 𝜇𝐵 • 𝑈𝑇 = 3 2 𝑘𝑇 = 0.039 𝑒𝑉 • 𝑈𝐵 = 2𝜇𝐵𝐵 = 0.00017 𝑒𝑉 • 1eV = 1.6 x 10-19 J • Hence, thermal much greater than magnetic moment energy is most cases. 17 Paramagnet in External B- field • Magnetisation is define as: • 𝑴 = 𝑛 < 𝝁 > • Where n is the number of magnetic dipoles per unit volume. 18 i.e. this is the total magnetic moment per unit volume. Paramagnet in External B- field • So total magnetic field inside paramagnet 𝐵𝑇 = 𝐵0 + 𝐵𝑚 where B0 is the external B- field. i.e. 𝐵𝑇 = 𝐵0 + 𝜇0𝑀. • For “well behaved materials” 𝑀 ∝ 𝐵0 19 The alignment of the magnetic dipoles produces an additional B-field Bm such that 𝐵𝑚 = 𝜇0𝑀 Paramagnet in External B- field 20 𝐵𝑇 = 𝐵0 + 𝜇0𝑀. 𝑀 ∝ 𝐵0 and we define the magnetic susceptibility, m (dimensionless) such that: 𝑀 = 𝑚𝐵0 𝜇0 Hence: 𝐵𝑇 = 𝐵0 + 𝜇0 𝑚𝐵0 𝜇0 = (1 + 𝑚)𝐵0 The relative permeability r is define as 𝜇𝑟 = (1 + 𝑚) So the B-field is increased by a factor r Paramagnetic Material • Paramagnetic materials have a small, positive susceptibility to magnetic fields. These materials are slightly attracted by a magnetic field and the material does not retain the magnetic properties when the external field is removed. Paramagnetic properties are due to the presence of some unpaired electrons, and from the realignment of the electron paths caused by the external magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include magnesium, molybdenum, lithium, and tantalum. • Paramagnetic materials have r greater than but close to 1. r doesn’t change much with B-field strength but does with temperature. 21 Ferromagnetism • Materials with atoms having unpaired electron spins (iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, and dysprosium). Electron spins aligned  1010 atoms combine to form a domain (l  10-7 m)  large magnetic moment. • When the domains are randomly arranged, the specimen as a whole is not magnetised. 22 Ferromagnetism • Domains which are magnetized in the direction of an external magnetic field grow at the expense of those which are not aligned to the magnetic field. • r becomes very large  103 →105 23 Bex 𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙 = 𝜇𝑟𝐵𝑒𝑥 Ferromagnetism 24 Magnetization Curve for a Ferromagnetic Material All magnetic moments in the material are aligned parallel to the external field Ferromagnetism: Hysteresis Loops 25 Magnetization is different when the external magnetic field is increasing from when it is decreasing - hysteresis loop Explanation - reorientations of domain directions are not totally reversible Uses - magnetic storage of information Applications of Ferromagnetism 26 Material μ/(H m-1) μr Application Ferrite U 60 1.00E-05 8 UHF chokes Ferrite M33 9.42E-04 750 Resonant circuit RM cores Nickel (99% pure) 7.54E-04 600 - Ferrite N41 3.77E-03 3000 Power circuits Iron (99.8% pure) 6.28E-03 5000 - Ferrite T38 1.26E-02 10000 Broadband transformers Silicon GO steel 5.03E-02 40000 Dynamos, mains transformers supermalloy 1.26 1000000 Recording heads Diamagnetism • No intrinsic magnetic dipoles • Dipole moments induced by an external magnetic field • Induced B-field opposes the external field (Lenz’s law) B < B0 • i.e. r < 1 (slightly) 27 rC Relative Permeabilities 28 Paramagnetic Diamagnetic Ferromagnetic material r material r material r Platinum 1.000265 Copper 0.999994 Iron (99.95% pure Fe annealed in H) 200,000 Aluminum 1.000022 Water 0.999992 Mu-metal 20,000 Air 1.00000037 Bismuth 1 – 1.910-5 Cobalt-iron (high permeability strip material) 18000 Oxygen 1.00133 Beryllium 1 – 1.310-5 Iron (99.8% pure) 5,000 Liquid Oxygen (-190oC) 1.00327 Methane 1 – 3.110-5 Ferrite (manganese zinc) 640+ Nickel Monoxide 1.000675 Glass 1 – 1.510-5 Carbon steel 100 Summary • Paramagnetic materials are (weakly) attracted by a magnetic field, have intrinsic magnetic dipole moments that tend to line up with an external magnetic field, thus enhancing (slightly) the field. This tendency is interfered with by thermal agitation. • Diamagnetic materials are (weakly) repelled by the pole of a strong magnet. The atoms of such materials do not have intrinsic magnetic dipole moments. A dipole moment may be induced, however, by an external magnetic field, its direction being opposite that of the field. Not temperature dependent. • 𝝁𝒓 ≈ 𝟏 in both cases 29 Summary • Ferromagnetic materials result from spontaneous alignment of the dipole moment of atoms and the formation of large magnetic domains.
