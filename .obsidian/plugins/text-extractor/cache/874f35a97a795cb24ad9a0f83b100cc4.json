Special Relativity & Dynamical Systems 2024-2025 Dynamical Systems Assessed Problem 2 Problem 2.1 A Rod on a String A uniform rod AB is supported at an angle α to the horizontal by a light string attached to A, with its lower end B on a rough horizontal plane with coeﬃcient of friction, µ . (a) Draw a diagram of the system, and mark on all the forces. [3] (b) Derive the equations for force balance in the horizontal and vertical directions, and for torque balance around A. [3] (c) Solve these equations to derive expressions for the various forces in the problem in terms of the weight, mg, of the rod. [3] (d) Show that the greatest inclination, θ, of the string to the vertical is given by cot θ = 1 µ ± 2 tan α, according to the direction in which the end B is going to move. [1] Assessed Problems 2 Richard Mason 03 33961 Introduction to Probability and Statistics Problem 1. A quantum mechanical particle is conﬁned to a region of the x-axis for which 0 ≤ x ≤ a (where a > 0). The particle has a Probability Density Function (PDF) describing the position given by P (x) = {Ax2(a3 − x3) if 0 ≤ x ≤ a 0 otherwise 1. For a PDF, P (x), deﬁne ⟨x⟩, ⟨x2⟩, var(x) and std(x). The sample space for x can be assumed to be the entire real line here. [3] 2. Calculate the value of A such that the PDF is properly normalised. [2] 3. Calculate the expectation value of the position. [2] 4. Calculate the standard deviation of the position. [2] 5. Calculate the value m such that 1 2 = ∫ m 0 P (x)dx otherwise known as the median.
