(b) Show that y(x, t) = f (x ! vt) satisfies the wave equation, no matter what the functional form of f. (c) A wave pulse is described by the function y(x, t) = De!(Bx!Ct )2 , where B, C, and D are all positive constants. Show that this wave function satisfies the wave equation and hence find the speed of this wave.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
