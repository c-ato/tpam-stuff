Evans d.evans@bham.ac.uk Last Lecture • Gauss’s Law – Examples using Gauss’s Law – E-fields in conductors – E-field between charged Conducting Plates 2 Lecture 4c Content • Final Note on Gauss’s Law – Choosing a Gaussian surface • E-field between non-conducting plates 3 Gaussian Surface • Use Gauss’s Law in case where there is symmetry – E.g. sphere, infinite planes, infinite line charges • Choose Gaussian surface such that the E-field is normal to the Gaussian surface such that: 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = E dS and E is constant at surface i.e. ׬𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = ׬𝑆 𝐸 𝑑𝑆 = 𝐸 ׬𝑆 𝑑𝑠 • Hence ׬𝑆 𝑑𝑠 is just the area of the surface. 4 Non-conducting Charged Parallel Plates (infinite) • Surface charge from LHS plate gives field: 𝐸𝐿 = 𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 (see Lec. 3) • Surface charge from RHS plate gives field: 𝐸𝑅 = −𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒏 = 𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 – Where ෝ𝒏 is the unit vector normal to the surface. • Superposition principle gives: • 𝐸 = 𝐸𝐿 + 𝐸𝑅 = 𝜎 𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 5  - E ෝ𝒙 Note: Same result as for conducting parallel plates (last lecture) – WHY?

So add initial E-fields: 𝜎𝑖 𝐸 = 𝜎𝑖 𝜀0 + 𝜎𝑖 𝜀0 = 2𝜎𝑖 𝜀0 = 𝜎 𝜀0 Where  is final charge density Back to Non-conducting Charged Parallel Plates • E-field in between plates 𝐸 = 𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 + 𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 = 𝜎 𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 • E-field to the left of plates: 𝐸 = − 𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 + 𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 = 0 • E-field to the right of plates: 𝐸 = 𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 − 𝜎 2𝜀0 ෝ𝒙 = 0 • E-field outside non-zero if plates have different charge densities.
