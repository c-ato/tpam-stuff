Three charges, +q, +Q and −Q, are placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle as shown in the 1. Which of the following statements is true? The net force on the charge +q due to the other two charges is: (a) vertically up; (b) vertically down; (c) zero; (d) horizontal to the left; (e) horizontal to the right. 2. Which of the above statements is true if the −Q charge is replaced by a +Q charge? Problem 2. Two charges q1 and q2 are placed at the vertices of a right-angled triangle as shown in the Figure below. The value of the charge q1 is |q1| = 15µ C, but its sign is not know. For the charge q2, both the sign and the magnitude are not known. The resulting electric ﬁeld E produced by the two charges at P is as shown, in the negative y direction. 1. Based on symmetry considerations, deduce the sign of the charges q1 and q2. 2. Evaluate the value of the charge q2. 3. Evaluate the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld E at P . 1 ⋆Problem 1.1 Comparison of Magnesium and Uranium The density of solid magnesium is 1.7 × 103kg m−3 and its atomic mass is 24.3 amu. The corresponding ﬁgures for solid uranium are 1.9 × 104 kg m−3 and 238 amu. (i) Work out the number of atoms per cubic metre in solid magnesium and solid uranium. (ii) Estimate the mean separation between the centres of neighbouring atoms for these two solids. (iii) How do your answers compare with the sizes of the atoms?
