Diagonalise the matrix [ −3 4 4 3 ] ﬁnding the eigenvalues and the right eigenvectors. Answer 1. The equation that we need to solve is [ −3 − λ 4 4 3 − λ ] [ α β ] = [ 0 0 ] ⇒ (λ + 3)(λ − 3) − 4 × 4 = λ 2 − 25 = 0 For the two eigenvalues λ = ±5 we need [ −8 4 4 −2 ] [ 1 2 ] = [ 0 0 ] [ 2 4 4 8 ] [ 2 −1 ] = [ 0 0 ] to provide the required solution. 2. Diagonalise the matrix [ 0 12 12 10 ] ﬁnding the eigenvalues and the right eigenvectors. Answer 2. The equation that we need to solve is [ −λ 12 12 10 − λ ] [ α β ] = [ 0 0 ] ⇒ λ(λ − 10) − 12 × 12 = (λ − 5)2 − 25 − 144 = 0 For the two eigenvalues λ = 5 ± 13=18, -8 we need [ −18 12 12 −8 ] [ 2 3 ] = [ 0 0 ] [ 8 12 12 18 ] [ 3 −2 ] = [ 0 0 ] to provide the required solution. 3. Diagonalise the matrix [ −4 5 −5 2 ] ﬁnding the eigenvalues and both types of eigenvector. Answer 3. The equations that we need to solve are [ −4 − λ 5 −5 2 − λ ] [ α β ] = [ 0 0 ] ⇒ (λ + 4)(λ − 2) + 5 × 5 = (λ + 1)2 − 1 − 8 + 25 = 0 [ ˜α ˜β ] [ −4 − λ 5 −5 2 − λ ] = [ 0 0 ] 1 For the two eigenvalues λ = −1 ± 4i we need [ −3 ∓ 4i 5 −5 3 ∓ 4i ] [ 5 3 ± 4i ] = [ 0 0 ] [ −5 3 ± 4i ] [ −3 ∓ 4i 5 −5 3 ∓ 4i ] = [ 0 0 ] to provide the required solution. 4. Two energy surfaces take the forms E + d = 1 For the second matrix we do not need to redo the analysis, only appreciate that the relative sign of the two components must change v+ = 1 with two straight line trajectories; x2=x1 which moves away from the origin and x2=-x1 which moves towards the origin. The general curves are hyperbolae (δx1 + δx2)(δx1 − δx2) = 4AB Close to [ ±1 0 ] we ﬁnd M = [ 0 1 −2 0 ] ⇒ λ = ± √2i [ ∓ √2i 1 −2 ∓ √2i ] [ 1 ± √2i ] = [ 0 0 ] We ﬁnd a general solution [ δx1 δx2 ] = Ae i √2t [ 1√2i ] + ¯Ae −i √2t [ 1 − √2i ] = 2 | A | [ cos √2(t − t0) − √2 sin √2(t − t0) ] with ellipses that have a major x2-axis x2 1 + ( x2 The only ﬁxed point is the origin and the stability matrix is M = [ −1 1 −4 −1 ] ⇒ (λ + 1)2 + 4 = 0 ⇒ λ = −1 ± 2i although this provides the exact solution. The eigenvectors satisfy [ ∓2i 1 −4 ∓2i ] [ 1 ±2i ] = [ 0 0 ] and so the solution is [ x1 x2 ] = Ae −t+2it [ 1 2i ] + ¯Ae −t−2it [ 1 −2i ] = 2 | A | e −t [ cos 2(t − t0) −2 sin 2(t − t0) ] and so we have a clock-wise spiral on ellipses with a major x2-axis x2 1 + ( x2 and so [ δx1 δx2 ] = e 2t [ A B ] and an unstable ﬁxed point with straight lines locally. Close to the point [ 0 1 ] we ﬁnd M = [ −2 0 0 1 ] and so [ δx1 δx2 ] = Ae −2t [ 1 0 ] + Be t [ 0 1 ] an unstable ﬁxed point that collapses quickly along the x1-axis and expands along the x2-axis. Close to the point [ 1 0 ] we ﬁnd M = [ 1 0 0 −2 ] and so [ δx1 δx2 ] = Ae −2t [ 0 1 ] + Be t [ 1 0 ] an unstable ﬁxed point that collapses quickly along the x2-axis and expands along the x1-axis. Close to the point [ 1 1 ] we ﬁnd M = [ −1 0 0 −1 ] and so [ δx1 δx2 ] = e −t [ A B ] and a stable ﬁxed point with straight lines locally. Close to the point [ 2 2 ] we ﬁnd M = [ 0 2 2 0 ] ⇒ λ = ±2 ⇒ [ ∓2 2 2 ∓2 ] [ 1 ±1 ] = [ 0 0 ] and so [ δx1 δx2 ] = Ae 2t [ 1 1 ] + Be −2t [ 1 −1 ] and an unstable ﬁxed point that collapses along the line x2=-x1 and expands along x2=x1 with local hyperbolae as the trajectories (δx1 + δx2) (δx1 − δx2) = 4AB 6 We may separate the variables dx1 λ− = a + d","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
