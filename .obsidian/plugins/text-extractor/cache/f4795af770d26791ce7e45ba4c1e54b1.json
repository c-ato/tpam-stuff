(convex towards object); otherwise, it is negative ( concave towards object). Real images form on the side of a refracting surface that is opposite the object, and virtual images form on the same side of the object. 3) s: Positive if object on the same side of the incoming light. 2) s’: Positive if image is formed on the same side of the outgoing ray.

A cylindrical glass rod has index of refraction 1.52. It is surrounded by air. One end is grounded to a hemispherical surface with radius r = 2. 00 cm. A small object is placed on the axis of the rod, 8.00 cm to the left of the vertex. Find the image distance and the lateral magnification. Solution, use CP P’ s = 8.00 cm s’ n2=1.52 ? n1 = 1, n2 = 1.52, r = +2cm, s=+8 cm s’= +11.3 cm Because the image distance s’ is positive, the image is formed 11.3 cm to the right of the vertex (side of the outgoing ray). m is negative so image is inverted. Image is also smaller than object. CP P ’ CP s = 8.00 cm s’ = -21.3 cm n2=1.52 n1=1.33 If the glass rod is placed in water with a refractive index n1=1.33, then s’= –21.3 cm, a virtual image is formed 21.3 cm to the LEFT of the vertex. 97 degrees Water Air 48.6 O Snell’s window Royal Society Publishing photogr aphy competition.
