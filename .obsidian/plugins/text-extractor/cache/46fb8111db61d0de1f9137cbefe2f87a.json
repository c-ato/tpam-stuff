(This happens with all waves, sound waves and EM waves etc.) Interference: Waves interacting with one another. Standing waves are formed from interference. Geometric/ray optics. Lens/mirror are large. Visible light: Wave with a periodic changing electric/magnetic field. Constructive interference Destructive interference For the superposition of two harmonic waves of the same frequency and wavelength, the resultant wave is also harmonic, but amplitude depends on phase difference –we better prove it 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.5 1 1 0 sin x( )2 2 0 x Why do we square the amplitude? If more than two waves: Not difficult to do, but rather tedious, the alternative and much easier way is to use phasors Phasor diagram The rotating vector has a magnitude A, It rotates with angular frequency w. The projection of this vector on the horizontal axis gives displacement y. phasor A kx-wt f2 f1 f A2 A1 A Instead of finding the projections of vectors A1 and A2, we add the vectors first, then find the projection of Atotal.
