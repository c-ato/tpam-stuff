In an inertial frame Σ two events, A and B occur simultaneously at space points (x, y, z) = (±d, 0, 0).

In a galaxy far far away Luke Skywalker ﬂies on a spaceship away from the planet Abafar, where he was celebrating Master Yoda’s 500th birthday. After ﬂying for T = 1 year (according to his own clock) he discovers a fault in the navigation system of his spaceship which prevents him from returning to Abafar. He sends a distress radio message to Yoda asking for help and continues his journey with the same velocity V . Once Yoda receives the message he immediately ﬁgures out what the fault is and sends the repair instructions to Luke. After quickly ﬁxing the spaceship, Luke Skywalker makes a rapid U-turn, sends a message back to Earth and ﬂies back to Abafar. He arrives just in time to celebrate Master Yoda’s 900th birthday. The time and space coordinates ti, xi are assumed to be in the reference in which the planet Abafar is at rest. (a) Draw the Minkowski space-time diagram of the Luke’s journey. Use the the starting event at the origin, E0 = (t0, x0) = (0, 0). Indicate i. the event E1 when Luke sends his distress message, ii. the event E2 when Yoda receives and replies to Luke’s message, iii. the event E3 when Luke receives instructions from Yoda and starts his return journey, iv. the event E4 when Luke and Yoda meet again. [6] (b) Give the deﬁnition of proper time. Using this deﬁnition or an appropriate Lorentz transformation calculate the space-time coordinates of the event E1 = (t1, x1). State the relativistic effect behind this calculation. [6] (c) Assume the communications between Luke and Yoda are established using photons and neglect delays between receiving and sending messages. Use the events E2 = (t2, x2) and E3 = (t3, x3) to show that the farthest point of Luke’s trajectory from Abafar is x3 = c + V c − V x1 [8] (d) Using the results in parts (b) and (c) as well as the information given in the problem calculate the velocity V in units of speed of light c. i.e. ﬁnd V /c. [Hint: Use the fact that 1 − V /c = δ ≪ 1 and 3√0.00005 ≃ 0.037 ] [10] A35211 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 6. A cosmic ray photon γ with energy Eγ hits a proton at rest with mass mp = 940 MeV. As a result a π meson with rest mass mπ = 140 Mev is created in addition to the proton. (a) Write down the momentum of the photon Pγ (assumed to be positive) as well as energy and momentum Ep, Pp of the proton before the collision. [6] (b) Assuming an observer moves along the direction of the photon γ with velocity v write down the energy and momentum of each particle in the moving observer’s frame by using Lorentz transformation for energy and momentum. [8] (c) In the centre of mass frame the total momentum is zero. Find the velocity v if the observer is in the centre of mass frame. Express your answer in terms of Eγ and mp. [6] (d) Calculate the minimal (threshold) energy of the photon Eγ in MeV for the reaction to take place. [10] A35211 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 7.
