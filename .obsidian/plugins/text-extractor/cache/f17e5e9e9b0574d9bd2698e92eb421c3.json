Model solutions will only be released for the Assignment Question AQ1 and Questions Q1-Q4. Important: Late submissions will be penalised at a rate of 5% per day late up until exactly two days after the submission deadline, at which point the model solutions will be released and the Assignment will be closed to further submissions on Canvas. Your Assignment Question solutions must be submitted as a single PDF file. You may upload newer versions, BUT only the most recent upload will be viewed and graded. In particular, this means that subsequent uploads will need to contain ALL of your work, not just the parts which have changed. Moreover, if you upload a new version after the deadline, then your submission will be counted as late and the late penalty will be applied REGARDLESS of whether an older version was submitted before the deadline. In the interest of fairness to all students and staff, there will be no exceptions to these rules. All of this and more is explained in detail on the Submission of Continuous Assessment page in the Student Handbook on Canvas. Assignment Question AQ1. (a) (b) (c) 1 2 Questions Q1. Find the following antiderivatives and integrals: (a) ∫ sin 3(3x) cos 5(3x) dx (b) ∫ sin 7(x) cos4(x) dx (c) ∫ π 4 0 (tan(x) sec(x))8 dx Solution. (a) We substitute u(x) = sin(3x), noting that u ′(x) = 3 cos(3x), to obtain ∫ sin 3(3x) cos 5(3x) dx = ∫ sin 3(3x) cos 4(3x) cos(3x) dx = ∫ sin 3(3x)(1 − sin 2(3x))2 cos(3x) dx = 1 3 ∫ u 3(1 − u 2) 2 du = 1 3 ∫ (u 7 − 2u 5 + u 3) du = 1 24 sin 8(3x) − 1 9 sin 6(3x) + 1 12 sin 4(3x). Alternatively, using the substitution v(x) = cos(3x), noting that v′(x) = −3 sin(3x), we obtain the alternative antiderivative ∫ sin 3(3x) cos 5(3x) dx = 1 24 cos8(3x) − 1 18 cos6(3x). (b) We substitute u(x) = cos(x), noting that u ′(x) = − sin(x), to obtain ∫ sin 7(x) cos4(x) dx = ∫ sin 6(x) cos −4(x) sin(x) dx = ∫ (1 − cos2(x))3 cos−4(x) sin(x) dx = − ∫ (1 − u 2)3u −4 du = ∫ (−u−4 + 3u−2 − 3 + u 2) du = 1 3 sec3(x) − 3 sec(x) − 3 cos(x) + 1 3 cos3(x). (c) We substitute u(x) = tan(x), noting that u ′(x) = sec 2(x), to obtain ∫ π 4 0 (tan(x) sec(x))8 dx = ∫ 1 0 tan 8(x) sec 6(x) sec 2(x) dx = ∫ 1 0 tan 8(x)(tan 2(x) + 1)3 sec2(x) dx = ∫ 1 0 u 8(u6 + 3u 4 + 3u 2 + 1) du = [ 1 15 u 15 + 3 13 u 13 + 3 11 u 11 + 1 9 u 9]1 0 = 1 15 + 3 13 + 3 11 + 1 9 . 3 Q2. (a) For each n ∈ N ∪ {0}, suppose that In = ∫ (log(5x))n dx. Prove that In(x) = x(log(5x)) n − nIn−1(x) for all x > 0 and all n ∈ N, and use this formula to find ∫ (log(5x))3 dx. (b) Find the following antiderivatives: (i) ∫ 3x + 2 √x − 5 dx (ii) ∫ √x + 1 x dx (iii) ∫ 1 √4x2 + 9 dx Solution. (a) For each n ∈ N, we apply Integration by Parts with { u(x) = (log(5x))n v(x) = x and { u ′(x) = n(log(5x))n−1x−1 v′(x) = 1 to obtain In(x) = ∫ (log(5x))n dx = x(log(5x))n − ∫ n(log(5x))n−1x−1x dx = x(log(5x))n − n ∫ (log(5x))n−1 dx = x(log(5x))n − nIn−1(x) for all x > 0, as required. We apply this formula recursively to obtain ∫ (log(5x)) 3 dx = I3(x) = x log3(5x) − 3I2(x) = x log3(5x) − 3[x(log(5x)) 2 − 2I1(x)] = x log3(5x) − 3x log2(5x) + 6[x log(5x) − I0(x)] = x log3(5x) − 3x log2(5x) + 6x log(5x) − 6x, where in the last equality we used I0(x) = ∫ 1 dx = x. (b)(i) We substitute u(x) = √x − 5 for all x ∈ [5, ∞) by the Domain Convention, and noting that u : [5, ∞) → [0, ∞) is bijective with inverse x(u) = u 2 + 5 and x′(u) = 2u, we obtain ∫ 3x + 2 √x − 5 dx = ∫ 3(u 2 + 5) + 2 u 2u du = ∫ (6u2 + 34) du = 2(x − 5) 3 2 + 34(x − 5) 1 2 (b)(ii) We substitute u(x) = √x + 1 for all x ∈ [−1, ∞) by the Domain Convention, and noting that u : [−1, ∞) → [0, ∞) is bijective with inverse x(u) = u 2 − 1 and x′(u) = 2u, we 4 obtain ∫ √x + 1 x dx = ∫ u u2 − 1 2u du = 2 ∫ u 2 − 1 + 1 u2 − 1 du = 2 ∫ 1 du + 2 ∫ 1 u2 − 1 du = 2u + ∫ −1 u + 1 du + ∫ 1 u − 1 du = 2u − log |u + 1| + log |u − 1| = 2 √x + 1 − log |√x + 1 + 1| + log |√x + 1 − 1|, where we use the method of partial fractions to obtain the fourth equality. (b)(iii) We substitute x = 3 2 tan(θ) and note that x′(θ) = 3 2 sec2(θ), to obtain ∫ 1 √4x2 + 9 dx = ∫ 3 2 sec2(θ) √9(tan 2(θ) + 1) dθ = ∫ sec2(θ) 2 sec(θ) dθ = 1 2 ∫ sec(θ) dθ = 1 2 log | sec(θ) + tan(θ)|, where we used Example 7.1.2 in the Lecture Notes to obtain the final equality. To conclude, we using trigonometry to note that tan(θ) = 2x 3 = opp adj , where we regard θ as the acute angle in a right-angled triangle with opposite side-length 2x and adjacent side-length 3, hence sec(θ) = hyp adj = √4x2+9 3 . We thus have ∫ 1 √4x2 + 9 dx = 1 2 log ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 3 (√ 4x2 + 9 + 2x) ∣ ∣ ∣ = 1 2 log ∣ ∣ ∣√4x2 + 9 + 2x∣ ∣ ∣ − 1 2 log(3), where we could also omit the − 1 2 log(3) term since it is just an additive constant. Q3. Find, or prove divergence of, the following antiderivatives and integrals: (a) ∫ 6x + 1 x2 + 3x + 5 dx (b) ∫ sec4(3x) tan 4(3x) dx (c) ∫ ∞ 2 1 √2x − 3 dx (d) ∫ 6 5 1 √x2 − 25 dx Solution. (a) The denominator x 2 + 3x + 5 = (x + 3 2 )2 + 11 4 is an irreducible quadratic factor (since it has complex conjugate roots) so the method of partial fractions does not provide any simplification here. Instead, we aim to express the integrand as a linear combination of the antiderivatives ∫ 1 x2 + a2 dx = 1 a tan−1 ( x a ) and ∫ f ′(x) f (x) dx = log |f (x)| 5 with f (x) := x2 + 3x + 5 = (x + 3 2 ) 2 + ( √11 2 ) 2 ̸= 0 for all x ∈ R and a = √11 2 . In particular, since f ′(x) = 2x + 3, our aim is to find two real numbers α and β such that 6x + 1 = α(2x + 3) + β. This holds provided 2α = 6 whilst 3α + β = 1, thus α = 3 and β = −8. We combine this with the antiderivatives above (and the Substitution Formula) to obtain ∫ 6x + 1 x2 + 3x + 5 dx = 3 ∫ 2x + 3 x2 + 3x + 5 dx − 8 ∫ 1 (x + 3 2 )2 + ( √ 11 2 )2 dx = 3 log |x2 + 3x + 5| − 8 2√11 tan−1 ( 2√11 (x + 3 2 )) = 3 log |x2 + 3x + 5| − 16√11 tan −1 ( 1√11 (2x + 3)) . (b) We substitute u(x) = tan(3x), noting that u ′(x) = 3 sec2(3x), to obtain ∫ sec4(3x) tan 4(3x) dx = ∫ (tan 2(3x) + 1) sec2(3x) tan 4(3x) dx = 1 3 ∫ (u 2 + 1)u 4 du = 1 3 ∫ (u 6 + u 4) du = 1 3 ( 1 7 u 7 + 1 5 u5) = 1 21 tan7(3x) + 1 15 tan5(3x). (c) This is an improper integral, so we compute ∫ ∞ 2 1 √2x − 3 dx = lim t→∞ (∫ t 2 (2x − 3)− 1 2 dx) = lim t→∞ [ 2 2 (2x − 3) 1 2 ]t 2 = lim t→∞ [√2t − 3 − 1 ]t 2 = ∞, which proves that the improper integral is divergent. (d) We first find an antiderivative for the integrand, substituting x = 5 sec(θ) and noting that x′(θ) = 5 sec(θ) tan(θ), to obtain ∫ 1 √x2 − 25 dx = ∫ 1 √ 25(sec2(θ) − 1) 5 sec(θ) tan(θ) dθ = ∫ sec(θ) dθ = log | sec(θ) + tan(θ)| = log ( x 5 + √x2 − 25 5 ) = log (x + √x2 − 25 ) − log(5), where we used trigonometry to calculate tan(θ) = √x2−25 5 , since sec(θ) = x 5 . 6 We then use the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to compute ∫ 6 5 1 √x2 − 25 dx = lim t→0+ (∫ 6 5+t 1 √x2 − 25 dx) = lim t→0+ [ log (x + √ x2 − 25)]6 5+t = lim t→0+ (log(6 + √11) − log(5 + t + √10t + t2)) = log(6 + √11) − log(5). Q4. Find the value of the following improper integrals or prove that they are divergent: (a) ∫ 1 0 x log(x) dx (b) ∫ 10 0 x x − 5 dx (c) ∫ 0 − π 2 sec(x) dx Solution. (a) This is an improper integral because x log(x) is not defined at x = 0. We apply Integration by Parts with {u(x) = log(x) v(x) = 1 2 x2 and { u′(x) = x−1 v′(x) = x to obtain ∫ 1 0 x log(x) dx = lim δ→0+ (∫ 1 δ x log(x) dx) = lim δ→0+ ([ 1 2 x2 log(x)]1 δ − ∫ 1 δ 1 2 x dx) = lim δ→0+ ([ 1 2 x2 log(x) − 1 4 x2]1 δ ) = lim δ→0+ (− 1 4 − 1 2 δ2 log(δ) + 1 4 δ2) = − 1 4 + 1 2 lim δ→0+ ( − log(δ) δ−2 ) = − 1 4 + 1 2 lim δ→0+ ( −δ−1 −2δ−3 ) = − 1 4 + 1 4 lim δ→0+ (δ2) = − 1 4 , where we applied L’Hôpital’s Rule to obtain the sixth equality, which is justified since limδ→0+(− log(δ)) = ∞ = limδ→0+ δ−2. 7 (b) This is an improper integral because x x−5 is not defined at x = 5. It is convergent when both limδ→0+ ∫ 5−δ 0 x x−5 dx and limδ→0+ ∫ 10 5+δ x x−5 dx are finite. We find that ∫ 5 0 x x − 5 dx = lim δ→0+ (∫ 5−δ 0 x − 5 + 5 x − 5 dx ) = lim δ→0+ (∫ 5−δ 0 1 dx + ∫ 5−δ 0 5 x − 5 dx ) = lim δ→0+ ([x + 5 log |x − 5|] 5−δ 0 ) = lim δ→0+ (5 − δ + 5 log(δ) − 5 log(5)) = −∞. The improper integral is therefore divergent (there is no need to calculate the other integral in such case). (c) This is an improper integral because sec(x) is not defined at x = − π 2 . Using Example 7.1.2 from the Lecture Notes, we have ∫ 0 − π 2 sec(x) dx = lim δ→0+ (∫ 0 − π 2 +δ sec(x) dx ) = lim δ→0+ ([ log | sec(x) + tan(x)| ]0 − π 2 +δ ) = lim δ→0+ (− log | sec(δ − π 2 ) + tan(δ − π 2 )| ) = − lim δ→0+ (log ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 + sin(δ − π 2 ) cos(δ − π 2 ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ) = ∞, where the final equality holds because lim δ→0+ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 + sin(δ − π 2 ) cos(δ − π 2 ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = lim δ→0+ 1 + sin(δ − π 2 ) cos(δ − π 2 ) = lim δ→0+ cos(δ − π 2 ) − sin(δ − π 2 ) = 0 and limx→0+ log(x) = −∞. In particular, note that the application of L’Hôpital’s Rule here is justified because limδ→0+(1+sin(δ − π 2 )) = 0 = limδ→0+ cos(δ − π 2 ). The improper integral is therefore divergent. 8 Extra Questions EQ1. A cylindrical water tank is mounted sideways, so it has a circular vertical cross-section. The tank is 10 meters in diameter.
