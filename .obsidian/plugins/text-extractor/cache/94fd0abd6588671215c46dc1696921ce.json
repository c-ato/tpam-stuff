WITH HONOURS FIRST-YEAR EXAMINATION 03 17483/ 03 20835 LC CHAOS IN NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS A SEMESTER 2 EXAMINATIONS 2021/22 Time Allowed: 1 hour Answer two questions. If you answer more than two questions, credit will only be given for the best two answers. The approximate allocation of marks to each part of a question is shown in brackets [ ]. All symbols have their usual meanings. Calculators may be used in this examination but must not be used to store text. Calculators with the ability to store text should have their memories deleted prior to the start of the examination. A formula sheet and a table of physical constants and units that may be required will be found at the end of this question paper. Page 1 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR Answer two questions. If you answer more than two questions, credit will only be given for the best two answers. 1. A forced damped pendulum is described by the equation d 2θ dt2 + dθ dt + sin θ = R cos t (1) (a) When R ≪ 1 find the attractor to leading order in R. [5] (b) Show that to order R3 the attractor can be found approximately by solving the equation d 2θ dt2 + dθ dt + θ = R cos t + A sin t + B sin 3t (2) where you should provide explicit representations for A and B. [8] (c) Find a representation for the attractor which is correct to order R3. [8] (d) Describe how the attractor has been physically altered by the increasing of R.

Find all the possible 1-cycles and establish for which range of control parameter they are stable. [8] Find all the possible 2-cycles and establish for which range of control parameter they are stable. [13] Find the attractor when it is either a 1-cycle or a 2-cycle.

(a) Show that cos 3πy = 4 cos3 πy − 3 cos πy (5) and use it to find an exact solution for this map in terms of a linear map for a value of a that you should determine. [5] (b) Depict the linear map in the restricted domain y ∈ [0, 1]. [5] (c) Employ base 3 to find a useful representation for your linear map. [10] (d) Find all the 1-cycles and 2-cycles for the linear map using base 3.
