Why is EM Important? 45 Why is this course important? Everyday materials are held together by electromagnetic forces Optics can only be fully understood through electromagnetic theory Technical applications – power generation, construction and development of electronics, telecommunications and computers… EM II in year 2 6 The aim of this course is to Lay Down the Foundations Leading to an Understanding and use of: Maxwell’s Laws of Electromagnetism Aim of Course 7 Maxwell’s Equations By around the 1860s, Maxwell had put together four equations which summarise all of the properties of electric and magnetic fields in a free space. 𝛻 ∙ 𝑬 = 𝜌 𝜀0 𝛻 ∙ 𝑩 = 0 𝛻  𝑬 = − 𝜕𝑩 𝜕𝑡 𝛻  𝑩 = 𝜇0 𝑱 + 𝜀0 𝜕𝑬 𝜕𝑡 where 𝛻 = 𝒊 𝜕 𝜕𝑥 + 𝒋 𝜕 𝜕𝑦 + 𝒌 𝜕 𝜕𝑧 (see EM2 lectures next year) These equations show that electric and magnetic forces are related and are aspects of a single force - electromagnetism 8 •We cannot fully understand Maxwell’s equations until we can appreciate the meaning of the fields E and B and the sources of these fields, the charges and the currents (hence the need for this course) 9 Syllabus & Outline of Course Electromagnetism I 10 Part I.

A hard, rigid and shiny resin, it was intended as an artificial substitute for ebony wood. It is often used in bowling balls, smoking pipe mouthpieces, fountain pen nib feeds, and high-quality saxophone and clarinet mouthpieces. It is also commonly used in physics classrooms to demonstrate static electricity . Ebony wood is one of the most intensely black woods known. With its very high density, it is one of the very few woods that sink in water. Aside 1516 Unit of Charge We now know, the elementary (smallest) unit of charge is the charge of an electron or proton (electrons negative charge, protons positive charge) i.e. 𝒆 = 𝟏. 𝟔𝟎𝟐𝟏𝟕𝟔𝟓𝟔𝟓 × 𝟏𝟎 −𝟏𝟗 C The unit is charge in S.I. units is the Coulomb. (Yes, I know quarks have fractional electric charge (d, s, b have -1/3 e and u, c, t have +2/3 e) but we don’t get free quarks 𝒆 = 𝟏. 𝟔 × 𝟏𝟎−𝟏𝟗 C Good enough for us Electrons and protons are stable (proton decay > 1031 years). This means that the net charge of an isolated system is constant. FURTHERMORE: eqq ep == Charge Conservation 1718 Electro-static Force Electric charges of the same sign repel and those of opposite sign attract. The force between two charges is proportional to the product of both charges i.e. 𝑭  𝒒 𝟏𝒒 𝟐 (note a negative force means attractive and positive means repulsive in this context) 19 Force at a Distance • So, just like the case of masses and gravity, an electric charge will exert a force on another charge at a distance – without actually coming into contact with it. • So there must be something between the charges which mediates the force. • (In my field of research the mediators of the electromagnetic force are virtual photons, electrons, and positrons – but quantum field theory is a little advanced for year 1). 20 The Electric Field • In classical physics, we say a charge produces an electric field around it. Another charge (a test charge) would interact with this field and that causes the force. • The electric field, E is define thus: 𝑭 = 𝑬 𝑞 where F is the force exerted on a test charge q by a charge (say Q) producing a field E. E-field has units N C-1. 𝑬  𝑄 as 𝑭  𝑄𝑞 21 E-Field from Point Charge, Q r Q Consider a point charge with an electric field spreading out from it in all directions. As the distance r, from the charge Q, increases the field will be spread out over a larger area. At a distance r from the charge, we can imagine a spherical surface where the E-field is spread over. As the surface area of a sphere of radius r is 4𝜋𝑟2 the strength of the field must decrease with distance as 4𝜋𝑟2. 22 Coulomb’s Law Hence 𝑬  𝑄 4𝜋𝑟2 The (inverse) constant of proportionality, in a vacuum, is known as the permittivity of free space, 𝜀0. In S.I. units: 𝜀0 = 8.854 × 10−12 C2m-2N-1. So: E = 𝑬 = 𝑄 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟2 This is known as Coulomb’s Law (I assume you all know this already) Direction of E-field (Force) • Force is a vector and hence so is electric field ➢ 𝑭 = 𝑞 𝑬 • Consider E-field from a point charge Q at a distance r – Assume E has components 𝐸𝑟 , 𝐸𝜃 and 𝐸 . 23 r Q 𝐸𝜃 If 𝐸𝜃 was, say, in the clockwise direction from our view point, then from the other side of the charge, 𝐸𝜃 would be in the anti-clockwise direction but everything else would like exactly the same. The laws of Physics should be the same from all view points so 𝑬𝜽 must be zero and the same goes for 𝑬∅. E-Field from Point Charge • So E-field of a point charge is radial i.e. 𝑬 = 𝑄 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟2 ො𝒓 2425 Electro-static Force Force between two charges, q1 and q2: Force on q2 due to E-field from q1 is F1 = E1q2 This equals force on q1 due to E-field from q2 : F2 = E2q1 I.e. force between two charges is: 𝑭 = 𝑞1𝑞2 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟2 ො𝒓𝟏𝟐 In SI units where: q1 and q2 are in Coulombs r in metres F in Newtons Forces between many charges - the principle of superposition • What if you have more than two positive charges? Procedure: • Consider one pair of charges at a time • Vector sum the forces 26 q2 q3 F12 F21 q1 F31 F13 Ftotal Force due to Many Charges • In general the force on a charge q due to a collection of charges is the vector sum of all the individual forces due to all the others where ri is the distance from qi to q & ො𝒓𝑖is the unit vector between them • This is known as the principle of superposition of forces 27 𝐹 = 𝐹1 + 𝐹2 + 𝐹3 + … = 𝑞 ෍ 𝑖 𝑞𝑖 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟𝑖2 Ƹ𝑟𝑖 Electric Field due to many Charges • But 𝐹 = 𝑞𝐸 • So electric field at the test charge, q must be: where ri is the distance from qi to q & ො𝒓𝑖is the unit vector between them. • Thus, the E at a certain point is equal to the electric force per unit charge at that point. • I.e. the E at a certain point is equal to the vector sum of the E-fields from all the charges. 28 𝐸 = ෍ 𝑖 𝑞𝑖 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟𝑖2 Ƹ𝑟𝑖 Example of Many Charges 1.
