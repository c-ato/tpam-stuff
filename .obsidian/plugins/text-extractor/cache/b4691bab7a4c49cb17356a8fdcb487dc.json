Introduction Topological quantum ﬁeld theories are characterized by the property that their observables only depend on the global characteristics of the space on which they are deﬁned. In other words, their observables compute topological invariants of said space, and thus, in particular, don’t depend on the metric. As any quantum ﬁeld theory, a TQFT can be studied in a Hamiltonian framework or using its Lagrangian description and the path integral. The former approach is characterized by a trivial Hamiltonian H = 0. Nevertheless, nontrivial propagation does occur through topologically nontrivial spacetimes. This approach was axiomatized in [1] and is the subject of the ﬁrst part of these lecture notes. In the path integral approach to topological quantum ﬁeld theory two distinct mechanisms have been developed to ensure that observables are independent of the metric. The ﬁrst one, not covered in these lectures, insists on that neither the action nor the observables have any explicit metric dependence. Such topological quantum ﬁeld theories are called of Schwarz-type, after the author of the paper [2]. An important example of this type is three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, which facilitates the computation of invariants of three-manifold and knots embedded therein [3]. The second mechanism is cohomological in nature: only after passing to the cohomology of a particular nilpotent charge does the metric dependence disappear. Topological twisting provides a powerful and widely applicable method to construct quantum ﬁeld theories with a suitable nilpotent charge [4]. The second part of these lecture notes studies this setup. These notes do not intend to be original or comprehensive. For example, we have omitted the rephrasing of the axiomatic deﬁnition of a topological quantum ﬁeld theory in categorical language, and have barely scratched the surface of cohomological quantum ﬁeld theory and the computation of its topological observables. Instead, these lectures aim to give a pedestrian introduction to the above-mentioned topics. Many lecture notes, reviews, and text books are readily available, for example [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], for the interested reader to continue their study of topological quantum ﬁeld theory. These notes are organized as follows. In section 2 we brieﬂy review some aspects of topology and introduce cobordisms. In section 3, we develop the axiomatic approach to topological quantum ﬁeld theory, focusing in particular on two-dimensional theories. This section is largely based on the excellent text book [8]. Finally, section 4 introduces cohomological topological quantum ﬁeld theories and explores Witten’s topological twisting, mostly following the seminal paper [4]. 2. Topological properties and cobordisms A topological quantum ﬁeld theory is a quantum ﬁeld theory deﬁned on a topological space whose observables compute topological properties of that space. Let us start by explaining the mathematical ingredients of this deﬁnition. 2.1 Topological invariants Mathematically, a topological space is an ordered pair (X, τ), with X a set and τ a collection of subsets of X, such that i) /0 and X belong to τ, ii) any arbitrary (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) union of elements of τ belongs to τ, and iii) the intersection of any ﬁnite number of elements of τ belongs 1 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers to τ. The elements of τ are called open sets, while τ itself goes under the name of a topology on X. Intuitively, a topology tells us which points of X lie “close” or “in the neighborhood” of each other (without caring about any precise concept of distance). Indeed, the notion of a neighborhood formalizes this intuition. A subset N ⊆ X is a neighborhood of a point x ∈ X if there exists an open set U ∈ τ such that x ∈ U and U ⊆ N. A few examples of topological spaces are as follows: • for X any set, we can set τ equal to the collection of all subsets of X. This is called the discrete topology. • for X any set, we can take τ = { /0, X}. This is the so-called trivial topology. • a simple example of a topological space that is neither discrete nor trivial is the Sierpinski space. It is based on the set X = {0, 1} and chooses τ = { /0, {0, 1}, {1}}. • for applications in physics, the set X is most often a metric space and thus possesses a metric specifying the distance between points. We can use the metric to endow such space with a metric topology. The basic open sets are open balls deﬁned by the metric and τ comprises all their possible unions. To introduce topological properties or invariants, we ﬁrst deﬁne a function f : X → Y between the topological spaces (X, τX ) and (Y, τY ) to be continuous if for all x ∈ X and all neighborhoods N of f (x), there exists a neighborhood M of x such that f (M) ⊆ N.1 A homeomorphism f is a bijection with both f and f −1 continuous. Two topological spaces with a homeomorphism between them are essentially identical from the standpoint of topology. Finally, a topological property is a property of a topological space that is invariant under homeomorphisms. For metric spaces with the metric topology, roughly, a topological property is thus a property that does not depend on the choice of metric. 2.1.1 Classiﬁcation of connected, compact, topological surfaces For orientable and closed surfaces a complete classiﬁcation of topological surfaces is as fol- lows.2 Either it is the sphere or it is the connected sum of g tori for g ≥ 0. The topological property that tells these spaces apart is the number of holes g, also known as the genus. One often also considers the Euler characteristic χ = 2 − 2g. For orientable surfaces with boundary, the above classiﬁcation is extended by including the count of the (ﬁnite) number k of windows/punctures. The Euler characteristic is now computed as χ = 2 − 2g − k. In fact, since the surface is orientable, we can keep track of the number of in- and out-boundaries, kin and kout, separately. We denote a genus g surface with kin/out boundaries as Σg;kin,kout. Unorientable surfaces are classiﬁed topologically by their genus, their number of windows, and their number of cross-caps c. The latter can take the values c = 0, 1, 2. For example, a sphere with a cross-cap is the real projective plane, while a sphere with two cross-caps is the one-sided 1Note the analogy to the standard ε − δ deﬁnition of continuity ﬁrst encountered in high school for real functions f : R → R. 2A closed surfaces is a compact surface without boundary. The intuitive notion of compactness of (X, τ) can be formalized in topology by stating that any open cover of X has a ﬁnite subcover. 2 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers Figure 1: Simple examples of cobordisms M between m1 and m2. surface of the Klein bottle. The Euler characteristic reads χ = 2 − 2g − c − k. Note that if c ≥ 3, one can replace pairs of cross-caps by handles. 2.2 Cobordisms Cobordisms lie at the heart of the Hamiltonian picture of topological quantum ﬁeld theory. They are deﬁned as follows. Consider two closed manifolds m1, m2 of dimension n − 1. A cobor- dism between m1 and m2 is then a compact n-manifold M whose boundary is (homeomorphic to) m1 ⊔ m2. See ﬁgure 1 for some two-dimensional examples. Not all pairs of (n − 1)-dimensional manifolds are cobordant to each other. For example, any two closed one-manifolds are cobordant, but two closed 0-manifolds (a disjoint union of points) are cobordant if and only if the total number of points is even. For the purposes of these lectures, we will restrict attention to oriented cobordisms. An orien- ted cobordism between two closed, oriented manifolds m1, m2 of dimension n − 1 is a compact, oriented n-manifold whose in-boundary is (homeomorphic to) m1 and whose out-boundary is (ho- meomorphic to) m2. (We will always be working up to diffeomorphisms and henceforth won’t explicitly make the “up to homeomorphisms” disclaimer anymore.) We denote an oriented cobor- dism as M : m1 ⇒ m2. If m1 and m2 are homeomorphic, then an important cobordism is the cylinder: A second important cobordism is the U-tube. Consider m and ¯m, i.e., m with opposite orien- tation. We can consider the cylinder m ⇒ ¯m, but as both boundaries are in-boundaries and the out-boundary is empty, it is customary to represent it as in ﬁgure 2a. Similar statements hold for the cylinder ¯m ⇒ m. 3 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers (a) (b) Figure 2: U-tube cobordisms. Figure 3: Example decomposition of a cobordism. Note that if n = 2, the topological surface Σg,kin,kout is a cobordism between ⊔kinS1 and ⊔koutS1, i.e., Σg,kin,kout : ⊔kinS1 ⇒ ⊔koutS1. Let us next consider an oriented cobordism M : m1 ⇒ m2. Pictorially, we can slice it somew- here in the middle, making sure that the slice is along an out-boundary, and thus ﬁnd a decomposi- tion of the original cobordism into two cobordisms M1 : m1 ⇒ m′ and M2 : m′ ⇒ m2, see ﬁgure 3. In particular, for the cylinder, we ﬁnd A different decomposition of the cylinder is presented in ﬁgure 4a. It gives rise to the snake decomposition, see ﬁgure 4b. 3. Axiomatic topological quantum ﬁeld theory In a Hamiltonian treatment of quantum ﬁeld theory, we associate Hilbert spaces of states to constant “time”, spatial slices, and we employ a time evolution operator (constructed in the usual manner from the Hamiltonian operator) to evolve states forward in time through spacetime. In stan- dard quantum ﬁeld theory on Rn, the constant “time” slices are Rn−1 and the Hamiltonian generates time-translations. In radial quantization of a conformal ﬁeld theory, on the other hand, the constant “time” slices are spheres Sn−1 centered at the origin and the Hamiltonian generates dilatations. In topological quantum ﬁeld theory, the spatial slices are (n − 1)-dimensional manifolds. To each of them, we assign a state space. What’s more, the Hamiltonian is zero, so no real dynamics takes place when evolving along a cylinder. However, non-trivial propagation does occur if the interve- ning manifold has nontrivial topology (and will only depend on that topology). In other words, the full spacetime is an n-dimensional manifold and time evolution is described by that manifold. 4 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers (a) (b) Figure 4: The snake decomposition of the cylinder. 3.1 Deﬁnition of axiomatic TQFT These considerations lead us to the deﬁnition of an n-dimensional topological quantum ﬁeld theory as introduced by Atiyah [1]. It is a rule Z which i) assigns to each (n − 1)-dimensional, closed, oriented manifold m a vector space Z(m) ii) assigns to each oriented cobordism M : m1 ⇒ m2 a linear map Z(M) : Z(m1) → Z(m2) such that the following axioms hold: A1: equivalent cobordisms must have the same images, i.e., if M is homeomorphic to M′ then Z(M) = Z(M′) A2: the cylinder m × I : m ⇒ m maps to the identity map, i.e., Z(m × I) = idZ(m) A3: if a cobordism M can be decomposed as M = M′M′′ then Z(M) = Z(M′′) ◦ Z(M′) (composi- tion of linear maps) A4: disjoint unions map to tensor products – if m = m1 ⊔ m2, then Z(m) = Z(m1) ⊗ Z(m2) – if a cobordism M : m1 ⇒ m2 is the disjoint union of M′ : m′ 1 ⇒ m′ 2 and M′′ : m′′ 1 ⇒ m′′ 2, then Z(M) = Z(M′) ⊗ Z(M′′) A5: empty manifolds m = /0 map to the ground ﬁeld K, which we will take to be simply C in these lectures. An immediate consequence is that the cylinder over the empty manifold is the identity map on K Note that the ﬁrst two axioms implement the topological nature of the theory. 3.2 Some immediate consequences 3.2.1 Pairing and copairing Let m be a closed (n − 1)-manifold and let V = Z(m) and W = Z( ¯m). Then we immediately ﬁnd the existence of a pairing Z ( ) ≡ β : V ⊗W → K (3.1) 5 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers and a copairing Z ( ) ≡ γ : K → W ⊗V . (3.2) Let us reconsider the snake decomposition of the cylinder, see ﬁgure 4b. It states that V idV−−→ V A3 = V idV ⊗γ −−−→ V ⊗W ⊗V β ⊗idV −−−→ V , (3.3) where we also used axiom A4. Let’s denote β (v, w) = ⟨w|v⟩, and let’s specify the copairing γ by γ(1K) = ∑ n i=1 wi ⊗ vi, where wi ∈ W, vi ∈ V . The snake then acts on an element x ∈ V as x ↦→ ∑ i x ⊗ wi ⊗ vi ↦→ ∑ i ⟨wi|x⟩vi . (3.4) As the snake is a decomposition of the cylinder cobordism, we learn that x = ∑i⟨wi|x⟩vi. We thus conclude that the pairing β is nondegenerate because if for all w ∈ W , ⟨w|x⟩ = 0 then the snake decomposition implies that x = 0, and, similarly, using the snake decomposition bending in the other direction, that if for all v ∈ V , ⟨y|v⟩ = 0 then y = 0. With this nondegenerate pairing, we can identify W = V ∗. 3.2.2 TQFTs and topological properties Topological quantum ﬁeld theories allow us to compute topological invariants. Indeed, let M be a closed n-manifold whose topological properties we are interested in. M can be considered as a cobordism M : /0n−1 ⇒ /0n−1. Acting with the rule Z, we ﬁnd a linear map Z(M) : K → K. Linear maps from the ground ﬁeld to itself are fully speciﬁed by the constant Z(M)(1K). This constant is a topological invariant as per the axioms that Z obeys, in particular axiom A1. It can be computed explicitly by cutting up the manifold M in various ways and using axiom A3. A simple example is the product manifold M = m ×S1 for some (n −1)-manifold m. If Z(m) = V , we immediately ﬁnd by cutting M in half: K Z(M) −−−→ K = K γ −→ V ∗ ⊗V β −→ K , (3.5) and thus Z(M)(1K) = dimV .3 The dimension of the vector space assigned to the manifold m is thus a topological invariant of M = m × S1. 3.3 Two-dimensional TQFTs In a two-dimensional topological quantum ﬁeld theory, we need to know the vector space Z(S1) = V and a rule that maps any cobordism to a linear map subject to axioms A1-A5. However, we know that we can cut up cobordisms and consider the relevant compositions (see A3). There- fore, we can try to decompose any cobordism in terms of a small set of cobordisms that generate, by composition, all cobordisms. If we know the corresponding linear maps of this generating set of cobordisms, we have all necessary information that deﬁnes the TQFT. 3Some more details of this computation are as follows. Let ei be a basis for V and f j be a basis for V ∗. Further- more, let γ : K → V ∗ ⊗ V : 1K ↦→ ∑i, j γ i j f j ⊗ ei, and let β : V ⊗ V ∗ → K be deﬁned by ⟨ f j|ei⟩ = βi j. Then the snake decomposition tells us that for all x =∼i λiei we have ∑i λiei = ∑i,k,l λiγ lkβilek. Hence ∑l βilγ lk = δ k i . 6 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers Figure 5: Generators of 2-cobordisms. Figure 6: Pictorial proof that any 2-cobordism can be decomposed in terms of the generators of ﬁgure 5. 3.3.1 Generators of 2-cobordisms and their relations The full set of generators of 2-cobordisms is given in ﬁgure 5. We will assume symmetry of tensor-factors and further mostly ignore the last one. To prove that this is the full set of cobordisms, it is clearly sufﬁcient to prove that any Σg;kin,kout can be composed with these ingredients. Figure 6 makes clear that this is indeed the case. Note that when kin = 0 or kout = 0 we will need the cup and the cap. The generators of ﬁgure 5 are not independent, but obey various relations. We give the list of relations in ﬁgures 7-9 (omitting various other relations that involve the crossed cylinders). The proof of this statement can be found, for example, in [8]. 3.3.2 Two-dimensional TQFT as Frobenius algebra Given the results of the previous subsection, our task when deﬁning a two-dimensional TQFT is thus to assign linear maps to all the generators in ﬁgure 5 and to make sure that these maps satisfy the relations coming from the relations of these generators. Concretely, we have S1 ↦→ A (3.6) S1 ⊔ S1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ S1 ↦→ A n (3.7) ↦→ [idA : A → A] (3.8) ↦→ [η : K → A] (3.9) ↦→ [ε : A → K] (3.10) ↦→ [µ : A2 → A] (3.11) ↦→ [δ : A → A2] (3.12) 7 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers (a) Identity relations (b) Sewing in discs. Figure 7: Relations among the generators of 2-cobordisms. (a) (Co)-associativity (b) (Co)-commutativity. Figure 8: Relations among the generators of 2-cobordisms. Figure 9: Frobenius relation among generators of 2-cobordisms. A priori, A carries the structure of a vector space. However, the additional structure dictated by the images of the generators (satisfying the relations following from the images of ﬁgures 7-9) result in the algebraic structure of a Frobenius algebra. Note that in particular µ is simply the multiplication of the algebra. We have assumed it is commutative. Example. Let us consider an explicit example. Let A = K[t]/tn, i.e., the polynomial ring in one variable modded out by the ideal generated by tn. To make K[t]/tn into a Frobenius algebra, we need to provide an additional datum, namely the so-called Frobenius form. It deﬁnes the image ε of the cap. We take it to be ε : A → K : tn−1 ↦→ 1 and ti ↦→ 0 for i < n − 1. As for any two-dimensional topological ﬁeld theory, the cylinder maps to the identity operator idA : A → A. Furthermore, as mentioned above, µ : A2 → A is the multiplication of A. Finally, we also know that the image of the cup (also known as the “unit”) is η : K → A : 1K ↦→ 1A. Using the multiplication µ and the unit ε, we can construct the nondegenerate pairing β . Concretely, we take the basis of A = K[t]/tn over K to be 1,t,t2, . . . ,tn−1, and let us denote the basis of A∗ as fti, i = 0, . . . , n − 1. Then we ﬁnd that ⟨ fti|t j⟩ = ε(tit j) = ε(ti+ j) = δi+ j,n−1. Hence we can identify fti ≃ tn−1−i and A ≃ A∗. The copairing γ can be obtained as the dual of the pairing β . In our bases, it is given by γ : K → A2 : 1K ↦→ ∑i fti ⊗ti = ∑i tn−1−i ⊗ti. With these data, we can 8 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers construct the comultiplication δ : A → A2 as = (3.13) δ : A ≃ A ⊗ K idA⊗γ −−−→ A ⊗ A ⊗ A µ⊗idA −−−→ A ⊗ A : ti ↦→ ti ⊗∑ j tn−1− j ⊗ t j ↦→ ∑ j tn−1+i− j ⊗ t j . (3.14) One can now explicitly verify that all relations of ﬁgures 7-9 are indeed satisﬁed. Given the two-dimensional topological quantum ﬁeld theory, we can compute topological in- variants. For example, the two-sphere can be obtained by gluing the cup to the cap, i.e., Z(S2) : K η −→ A ε −→ K. One then ﬁnds ε(η(1K)) = ε(1A) = 0. Similarly, by gluing the cup to a one-to-two pair of pants, whose two out-boundaries we glue in turn to a two-to-one pair of pants, which we ﬁnally cap off with a cap, we ﬁnd for the torus ε(µ(δ (η(1K)))) = ε(µ(δ (1A))) = ∑ j ε(µ(tn−1− j ⊗t j)) = ∑ j ε(tn−1) = ∑ j 1 = n. This answer could of course have been more easily obtained as the di- mension of the vector space A. By ﬁrst computing the gluing of a one-to-two pair of pants to a two-to-one pair of pants in the form of the linear map A → A : ti ↦→ ntn−1+i, one can easily con- vince oneself that all higher-genus surfaces have invariant 0. Example. A TQFT that produces more reﬁned invariants is based on the algebra A = K[t]/(tn − 1), with Frobenius form ε : A → K : 1A ↦→ 1K and ti ↦→ 0 for i > 0. Indeed, one ﬁnds that Z(Σg;0,0) = ng. This TQFT computes the genus. 4. Schwarz- and Witten-type TQFTs Let us now develop the Lagrangian/path integral formulation of TQFT. We consider an n- dimensional, Riemannian manifold M with a metric gµν and a quantum ﬁeld theory deﬁned on this space described by the action S. Let us further identify a collection of observables Oα of the theory. Their correlation functions can be computed via the usual path integral ⟨Oα1 Oα2 . . . Oαk ⟩ = ∫ e−SOα1 Oα2 . . . Oαk . (4.1) The quantum ﬁeld theory with (selected) observables {Oα } is considered topological if δ δ gµν ⟨Oα1 Oα2 . . . Oαk ⟩ = 0 , ∀k ≥ 0 , ∀αi, i = 1, . . . , k . (4.2) In other words, if the correlators of the {Oα } are independent of the metric. Recall that we have argued before that on metric spaces topological invariants are metric independent. 4.1 Schwarz-type topological quantum ﬁeld theories To achieve the metric independence of (4.2), there are two options. The ﬁrst option is realized in so-called Schwarz-type topological quantum ﬁeld theories. These theories have the property that both the action and the observables are manifestly independent of the metric. Examples include 9 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers • BF-theories, whose action is given by S = tr ∫ M B ∧F, where F is the Lie algebra-valued two- form ﬁeld strength and B is a Lie-algebra valued n−2-form. Metric-independent observables in this theory are standard Wilson loops trR Pexp ∫ γ A, where trR denotes the trace in the representation R of the Lie algebra and γ is a closed one-cycle. An interesting example of this kind is two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory in the zero area limit. Let’s put two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on a surface Σ with metric gµν . The Yang-Mills action is given by SYM = 1 4e2 ∫ Σ d2x√ g tr F 2. Alternatively, it can be written as SYM = 1 2 ∫ Σ ( i tr φ F + 1 2 e2 vol(Σ) tr φ 2) , where vol(Σ) is the volume form. Indeed, upon per- forming the Gaussian integral over the Lie algebra-valued scalar ﬁeld φ , we recover the original action. In the limit where the second term goes to zero, the theory becomes of the BF-type. If we do keep the second term, the theory does not have full general covari- ance, but it is invariant under area-preserving diffeomorphisms. One can straightforwardly develop the Hamiltonian picture of this theory and compute the image of the generators of two-cobordisms under Z. As the state space is inﬁnite-dimensional, this theory (in the ap- propriate limit), while very similar, does not quite ﬁt within the framework of axiomatic topological ﬁeld theory developed above. An excellent set of lectures on two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory can be found in, for example, [6]. • Chern-Simons theory, which is described by the action S = tr ∫ M A ∧ dA + 2 3 A ∧ A ∧ A. Here M is any three-manifold and A is a gauge ﬁeld. The theory’s observables are again Wilson loops. A comprehensive set of lecture notes on Chern-Simons theory can be found in [9]. 4.2 Cohomological topological quantum ﬁeld theories In these lectures we will focus on the second option, namely cohomological or Witten-type to- pological ﬁeld theories. Let us assume that the quantum ﬁeld theory possesses an inﬁnitesimal symmetry generator, which we suggestively denote by Q. As Q is a symmetry, we have QS = 0. Let us further assume that Q is such that the observables are closed QOα = 0 and the stress-energy tensor is exact, δ S δ gµν = 2 √ gTµν = QKµν for some symmetric tensor K.4 Then we can argue as follows: δ δ gµν ⟨Oα1 Oα2 . . . Oαk ⟩ = − ∫ Oα1 Oα2 . . . Oαk δ S δ gµν e−S (4.3) = − ∫ Q ( Oα1 Oα2 . . . Oαk Kµν e −S) (4.4) = 0 (4.5) where we assumed for simplicity that the observables are independent of the metric, but it clearly sufﬁces that δ O δ gµν is exact for the argument to go through. Furthermore, we assumed that the path integral measure is invariant under Q, i.e., that Q is non-anomalous. Note that it may be the case that the action is not just closed QS = 0, but also exact S = QΛ. In this case, one can easily argue, similarly to the argument presented just now, that the correlation functions ⟨Oα1 Oα2 . . . Oαk ⟩ will be independent of the coupling constant. 4Even though we are already employing cohomological terminology in stating that objects are “closed” or “exact”, we do not necessarily impose that Q2 = 0. 10 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers 4.2.1 Topological twisting If we can ﬁnd or construct quantum ﬁeld theories with a symmetry Q satisfying the above pro- perties, a topological quantum ﬁeld theory will emerge. A very widely applicable tool to construct precisely such theories was given in [4], and goes under the name of topological twisting. It can be employed in various dimensions and with various amounts of supersymmetry, but here we will focus on the original case of four-dimensional N = 2 super Yang-Mills theory. We start with a brief reminder of N = 2 supersymmetry. The N = 2 Poincaré supersymmetry algebra contains eight supercharges organized as QI α , ˜Q ˙αI. Here α, ˙α are the usual SU(2)1 × SU(2)2 Lorentz indices, and I is an SU(2)R R-symmetry in- dex. The total R-symmetry is SU(2)R × U(1)r. The supercharges Q and ˜Q carry charges −1 and +1 under the abelian factor. In summary, the transformation rules of the supercharges under SU(1)1 × SU(2)2 × SU(2)R ×U(1)r are Q : ( 1 2 , 0, 1 2 ) −1 (4.6) ˜Q : (0, 1 2 , 1 2 ) +1 (4.7) Their algebra is {Q I α , ˜Q ˙αJ} = Pα ˙α δ I J , {QI α , QJ β } = εαβ ε IJZ , { ˜Q ˙αI, ˜Q ˙β J} = εαβ εIJ ¯Z , (4.8) where P is the momentum generator and Z the central charge. The latter won’t be important for our discussion. Note that, for example, Q1 α , ˜Q ˙α1 is an N = 1 subalgebra. The N = 2 vector multiplet can be decomposed in standard N = 1 multiplets as follows: (N = 2 VM) = (N = 1 VM ⊕ N = 1 χM in adjoint representation) , (4.9) where VM stands for vector multiplet and χM for chiral multiplet. In total, the ﬁeld content and its quantum numbers under SU(1)1 × SU(2)2 × SU(2)R ×U(1)r is thus bosons: Aµ : ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 0) 0 (4.10) φ , ˜φ : (0, 0, 0) ±2 (4.11) D(IJ) : (0, 0, 1) 0 (4.12) fermions: λ I α , ˜λ ˙αI : ( 1 2 , 0, 1 2 ) +1 ⊕ (0, 1 2 , 1 2 ) −1 . (4.13) Their transformation rules are given by    δ Aµ = i(ξ Iσµ ˜λI) − i( ˜ξ I ˜σµ λI) δ φ = −i ( ξ IλI) δ ˜φ = +i( ˜ξ I ˜λI) δ λI = 1 2 σ µν ξIFµν + 2 ( Dµ φ ) σ µ ˜ξI + 2iξI[φ , ˜φ ] + DIJξ J δ ˜λI = 1 2 ˜σ µν ˜ξIFµν ) + 2(Dµ ˜φ ) ˜σ µ ξI + ˜φ ˜σ µ Dµ ξI − 2i ˜ξI[φ , ˜φ ] + DIJ ˜ξ J δ DIJ = −( ˜ξI ˜σ µ Dµ λJ) + i(ξIσ µ Dµ ˜λJ) − 2[φ , ( ˜ξI ˜λJ)] + 2[ ˜φ , (ξIλJ)] + (I ↔ J) . (4.14) 11 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers Here ξ I α and ˜ξ ˙αI are constant supersymmetry parameters. The supersymmetric Yang-Mills action is given by SYM = 1 g2 YM ∫ d4x√ g tr [ 1 2 Fµν F µν − 1 2 DIJDIJ − 4Dµ ˜φ Dµ φ + 4[φ , ˜φ ] 2 −2i(λ Iσ µ Dµ ˜λI) − 2(λ I[ ˜φ , λI]) + 2(˜λ I[φ , ˜λI]) ] . (4.15) With these preparations, we are ready to implement Witten’s topological twisting. The idea is simply to lock the SU(2)2 and SU(2)R rotations. In other words, henceforth we consider SU(2)′ 2 = diag(SU(2)2, SU(2)R). The ﬁelds of the vector multiplet have the following transformation rules under the newly minted SU(2)1 × SU(2)′ 2 ×U(1)r symmetry group: bosons: ( 1 2 , 1 2 )0 still vector → Aµ (4.16) (0, 0)±2 still scalars → φ , ¯φ (4.17) (0, 1)0 self-dual two-form → D + µν (4.18) fermions: ( 1 2 , 1 2 )+1 vector → ψµ (4.19) (0, 1)−1 self-dual two-form → χ + µν (4.20) (0, 0)−1 scalar → η (4.21) Here we introduced twisted ﬁelds transforming under the novel symmetry group. The supercharges themselves now transform as ( 1 2 , 1 2 ) −1 ⊕ (0, 1) +1 ⊕ (0, 0) +1 . (4.22) Note in particular the presence of a scalar supercharge, which we will call Q. So far, on ﬂat space, we haven’t done anything really: we have just relabeled ﬁelds slightly unconventionally. However, it is an amazing fact that the supercharge Q can be preserved on any spin-manifold (and in fact, more generally, on any manifold admitting a SpinC structure). The Lagrangian we ought to consider is simply the covariantized ﬂat-space Lagrangian with a certain SU(2)R background connection, proportional to the spin-connection, turned on. When the Lagrangian is written in terms of twisted ﬁelds, we don’t have to actively worry about this background connection: the (spatial) index structure of the twisted ﬁelds suggests the proper Levi- Civita connections in the covariant derivative. Concretely, one ﬁnds that the on-shell action (after some trivial rescalings of ﬁelds) S = ∫ M4 d4x√ g tr [ 1 4 Fµν F µν + 1 2 φ Dµ Dµ ¯φ − iηDµ ψ µ + i(Dµ ψν )χ µν − i 8 φ [χµν , χ µν ] − i 2 ¯φ [ψµ , ψ µ ] − i 2 φ [η, η] − 1 8 [φ , ¯φ ] 2] . (4.23) is invariant under the transformation rules δ Aµ = iεψµ , δ φ = 0 , δ ¯φ = 2iεη , δ η = 1 2 ε[φ , ¯φ ] , (4.24) δ ψµ = −εDµ φ , δ χµν = ε(Fµν + 1 2 εµνρσ F ρσ ) . (4.25) 12 Introductory Lectures on Topological Quantum Field Theory Wolfger Peelaers Note that both the action and the transformation rules of course still respect the U(1)r symmetry. It is easy to verify that the (on-shell) algebra is given by [δε , δε ′] = Gauge(ρ) + equations of motion , (4.26) where ρ = −2iεε ′φ . Thus, on gauge invariant operators one has Q2 = 0. Having identiﬁed a nilpotent supercharge for a class of quantum ﬁeld theories we can place on any spin-manifold, we should still verify that the stress-energy tensor is Q-closed. A somewhat tedious and subtle computation conﬁrms this fact Tµν = {Q, Λµν } , for Λµν = 1 2 tr(Fµσ χ σ ν + . . .) (4.27) What’s more, one can also verify that L ′ = L + 1 4 Fµν ˜F µν = {Q, Λ} for Λ = 1 4 tr Fµν χ µν + . . . (4.28) We thus ﬁnd ourselves in precisely the situation we described before. Hence, the partition function of the theory on a four-manifold M4 computes a topological invariant of M4, namely Donaldson’s invariant. Let us conclude by observing that there are various topological observables. First of all, from (4.24) we see that Qφ = 0. Hence all gauge-invariant combinations of φ are topological obser- vables. In particular, for gauge group SU(2), one has W0(P) = 1 2 tr φ 2(P) for some point P ∈ M4. Note that ∂ ∂ xµ W0 = 1 2 ∂ ∂ xµ tr φ 2 = tr φ Dµ φ = i{Q, tr φ ψµ } , (4.29) so correlation functions of W0 do not depend on their insertion points on M4. More observables can be constructed via topological descent. We start by rewriting the com- putation of (4.29) as 0 = i[Q,W0] , dW0 = i{Q,W1} with W1 = tr(φ ψµ )dxµ . (4.30) Then we continue by writing dW1 = i[Q,W2] , dW2 = i{Q,W3} , dW3 = i[Q,W4] , dW4 = 0 , (4.31) with W2 = tr( 1 2 ψ ∧ ψ + iφ F), W3 = i tr(ψ ∧ F), and W4 = − 1 2 tr F ∧ F. Given a k-dimensional homology cycle on M4, we can consider I(γ) = ∫ γ Wk , and [Q, I(γ)} = ∫ γ [Q,Wk} = −i ∫ γ dWk−1 = 0 , (4.32) because γ is a homology cycle. Inserting these additional topological observables gives rise to the higher Donaldson’s invariants.
