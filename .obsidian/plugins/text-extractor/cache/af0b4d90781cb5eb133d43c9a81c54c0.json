Two scenarios (1) moving source (2) moving observer Source movingDopplehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsjOWZzrQpg 1) moving source (receiver at rest) Source has frequency: fs (period Ts=1/fs) speed of source: us velocity of waves in medium: v vTs usTs b f Case 2) receiver moving: If moving towards source of the wave, encounters more wave crests per second and thus higher frequency. 1 1 sin x( ) 1010 x ur  v If receiver moves away from source Speed of receiver: ur. To the receiver, wave with wavelength  appears to travel at v+ur The movement of the source or the receiver is measured relative to the medium: air. Doppler for light (relativity): Doppler shift in freq. depends on if source or receiver is moving relative to the medium. For light, for which there is no medium (propagates in vac), absolute motion cannot be detected; only relative motion of source and receiver can be determined. Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who proposed it in 1842 in Prague. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ File:Redshift.png Shock waves: is what happens when the velocity of the source is faster than the velocity of waves in the medium Speed boat phenomenon u = 0 0 < u < v v: velocity of sound u: velocity of source u = v Shock waveu > v, supersonic S h o c k w a v e S h o c k w a v e Effect of increasing source velocity: u v ut vt sin Shock wave Mach cone angle:  Mach number = u/v Along the path of the plane, the sound waves produced later are heard first.
