Relativistic velocity composition Figure 1: Left: light cone (∆s)2 = 0 separating time-like (∆s)2 > 0 and space-like (∆s)2 < 0 intervals. Right: in one space dimension light cone divides the ∆x - ∆t plane into four regions. For time-like intervals events can be put into time order, so that future and past of an event can be deﬁned: event 1 is in the future of the event (0, 0). In the space-like region events cannot inﬂuence each other as they are too far apart so even light signal cannot link them, like the event (0, 0) and event 2. Space-time interval and proper time We deﬁne now space-time interval. For two events happening in space positions r1 = (x1, y2, z1) and r2 = (x2, y2, z2) at time t1 and t2 respectively we have the invariant quantity, (∆s) 2 = (c∆t) 2 − (|∆r|) 2 = (c∆t) 2 − (∆x) 2 − (∆y)2 − (∆z) 2 , where ∆t = t2 − t1, ∆r = (∆x, ∆y, ∆z) = (x2 − x1, y2 − y1, z2 − z1). The quantity ∆s with dimensionality of length, is called space-time interval between two events. It is also invariant under Lorentz transformation. In particular, its value is zero for events connected via a light signal. For two-dimensional space these events can be represented as a cone in the (three- dimensional) space-time is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1, hence the name “light cone” also in three dimensions. The light cone divides intervals between events into two categories: \u0013 \u0012 \u0010 \u0011 • time-like for which (∆s)2 > 0 or |c∆t| > |∆r| • space-like for which (∆s)2 < 0 or |c∆t| < |∆r| Events connected by time-like intervals can inﬂuence each other, so an earlier event can be a cause for the later event. Similarly such events can be said to be in the future or in the past with respect to each other (see right panel in Fig. 1). Events connected by space-like intervals are too far apart so even a light signal cannot link them, therefore they cannot inﬂuence each other. It is also meaningless to speak about which of these event happens ﬁrst as they can be made to happen at the same time by appropriate choice of reference frame as the event 2 on the right panel of Fig. 1 . Similarly events separated by a time-like interval are happening at the same point of space in a certain reference frame for which (∆s) 2 = (c∆t)2 − (∆x) 2 = (c 2 − v2)(∆t) 2 = (c∆t ′) 2 thus the proper time interval ∆t′ = √ 1 − v2/c2∆t as expected. DM Gangardt 1 University of Birmingham SR Lecture 06 Interval. Causality. Relativistic velocity composition We can now reformulate the twin paradox by comparing the total space-time interval experienced by each of the twin. For the earth twin the space time interval is simply ∆se = cT as he does not move anywhere in the earth frame. For the travelling twin one must add the space-time intervals accumulated during each leg of his journey: ∆st = ∆sout + ∆sback = √ (cT /2)2 − (vT /2)2 + √ (cT /2)2 − (vT /2)2 = √ c2 − v2T , which is clearly shorter than the space-time interval of the earth twin1. Relativistic velocity composition Our knowledge of Lorentz transformations allows us to deduce the transformation law of velocities observed in diﬀerent inertial frames. Imagine an object having velocity u in the frame K as shown in Fig. 2. What is the velocity u′ observed in the inertial frame K′ moving itself with velocity Vrel with respect to K. For simplicity we consider only two-dimensional space: x and x′ axes are directed along the relative velocity between the frames, while y and y′ axes are perpendicular to it. We can decompose the velocity u = ux ˆx + uy ˆy into the longitudinal, ux and the transverse uy components. Figure 2: Velocity composition. To ﬁnd the corresponding components in the mov- ing K′ frame we write ux = dx dt , uy = dy dt and apply Lorentz transformation to the inﬁnitesimal intervals dt′ = γ(Vrel) (dt − (Vrel/c 2) dx) dx ′ = γ(Vrel)(dx − Vreldt) dy′ = dy . The transformed velocity component along the rela- tive motion u ′ x = dx′ dt′ = dx − Vreldt dt − Vrel c2 dx = dx dt − Vrel 1 − Vrel c2 dx dt = ux − Vrel 1 − Vrelux c2 . Applying the same logic to the transverse component we get u ′ y = dy′ dt′ = dy γ(Vrel) (dt − Vrel c2 dx ) = 1 γ(Vrel) dy dt 1 − Vrel c2 dx dt = 1 γ(Vrel) uy 1 − Vrelux c2 1One can even generalise this calculation to a case when the velocity of the travelling twin is not changing abruptly v → −v but depends smoothly on time. Let v(t) be the instantaneous velocity of the travelling twin, so that the diﬀerential displacement dx and time interval dt in the earth frame are related by dx = v(t)dt. The total accumulated space-time interval is given by the integral along the world line of the travelling twin ∆st = ∫ √ (cdt)2 − (dx)2 = ∫ T /2 −T /2 √ c2 − v2(t) dt , which is again smaller than ∆se = cT . DM Gangardt 2 University of Birmingham SR Lecture 06 Interval. Causality. Relativistic velocity composition These formulae diﬀer from the Galilean velocity transformation u′ x = ux − Vrel, u′ y = uy by the presence of a relativistic denominator, which becomes 1 in the non-relativistic limit Vrel/c → 0. Using the inverse Lorentz transformation dt = γ(Vrel) (dt ′ + (Vrel/c 2) dx′) dx = γ(Vrel)(dx′ + Vreldt ′) dy = dy′ . we get the inverse velocity composition law ux = u′ x + Vrel 1 + Vrelu′ x c2 , uy = 1 γ(Vrel) u′ y 1 + Vrelu′ x c2 . and the rule “either prime or minus” works again! Let us now demonstrate that the resulting velocity ux cannot exceed the speed of light no matter how close the velocities u′ x and Vrel are to speed of light. Let us take 1 − ux c = 1 − u′ x c + V c 1 + u′ x c V c = (1 − u′ x c ) (1 − V c ) 1 + u′ x c V c . The right side of this equation is positive for 0 < u′ x < c, 0 < V < c which guarantees that ux/c < 1. For the extreme case u′ x = c, V = c the result of their composition is ux = c + c 1 + c c2 c = 2c 2 = c . DM Gangardt 3 University of Birmingham","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
