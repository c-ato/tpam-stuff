A closed path around which an electrical current may flow. + V R +I Resistor only dissipates energy. The terminal where the current enters a resistor is always at the higher electrical potential. – Contains one or more active devices which deliver energy. e.g. battery - or a source of Electromotive Force (EMF) – Contains passive devices (e.g. resistors) which dissipate energy. – Current is taken to flow from points of higher electrical potential to points of lower electrical potential. – Conventional current flow is opposite to that of electrons. Battery converts chemical energy into electrical potential energy. - - Definition ▪ Charge (Coulomb, C) The unit of electrical charge is the Coulomb. Charge is quantized, that is, it comes in discrete amounts. The charge of an electron is –1.602x10-19 C. ▪ Current (Ampere, A) Electric current is defined as the rate at which charge flows through a given point in a circuit: I = Δ𝑄 Δ𝑡 ▪ Potential Difference (Volt, V) The work done when transferring charge from one point in a circuit to another: V = Δ𝑊 Δ𝑄 ▪ Resistance (Ohm, ), Ohm's law The ratio of the voltage across a circuit element to the current flowing through it. ▪ Power (Watt, W) is defined as the rate of doing work.
