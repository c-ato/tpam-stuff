The muons reach a particle detector, which detects the presence of 800 muons (no muon is absorbed in the process). A second particle detector is located 5 km away from the ﬁrst one along the particles’ trajectory. How many muons reach this second detector? In its rest-frame, the muon lifetime is τ = 2.2×10 −6 s. Particles decay according to N (t) = N0e−t/τ , where N0 and N (t) are the number of particles, initially and at proper time t, respectively. Assume both the detectors are 100% efﬁcient. [5] 2. In a conical pendulum, a bob of mass m is attached at the end of a thin, inextensible wire of length L (see ﬁgure below). The bob moves in a horizontal circle with constant speed, with the wire making a ﬁxed angle, θ, with the vertical.

Unpolarised light, travelling through air (nair=1), is incident on the top surface of a thin sheet of glass with refractive index nglass = 1.4. The glass sheet has a thickness of 0.1 µm and the bottom surface of the glass is also in contact with air.

EITHER (Part A) A toy-car of mass 50 g is on a vertical and frictionless circular track of radius R = 2 m, as shown in the diagremme below. The car is initially pushed along the track to compress a spring, with spring constant 900 N m−1, by 2 cm. The car is then released from rest at point A, at an angle θ0 = 35 ◦ to the vertical. B C θ1A θ0 R (a) What is the total energy of the car in A just before it is released? Assume the zero of the gravitational potential energy to be the bottom of the track (B).

[2] (d) What is the total work from A to B done by the gravitational force? [2] (e) The car passes point B and climbs up the other side of the track as far as point C, which is at an angle θ1 with respect to the vertical. Find θ1. [5] (f) Just before the toy-car starts to slide back from C to A, a child spills honey on the track. The coefﬁcient of kinetic friction between the car and the track is now µ = 0.25. i. Calculate the work done by friction from C to B. [4] ii. Calculate the speed of the car in B. [6] A37390 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR (Part B) A loading ramp of length L = 9 m is tilted upwards at an angle θ = 37◦ with respect to the horizontal. A crate of mass M = 80 kg is pulled from the bottom to the top of the the ramp along its sloping surface by a rope (of negligible mass) under constant tension T = 900 N that is parallel to the ramp. The coefﬁcient of friction between the crate and the ramp is µ = 0.25, and the crate is initially at rest at the bottom of the ramp. (a) What work is done on the crate by the tension T ? [2] (b) What work is done on the crate by the force of friction? [2] (c) What is the increase in potential energy when the crate is at the top of the ramp? [2] (d) Using the results above, what is the increase in kinetic energy and the speed of the crate at the top of the ramp? [5] (e) By considering all forces acting on the crate, calculate its acceleration. Use this acceleration to calculate the crate’s speed at the top of the ramp. [4] (f) At the top of the ramp the crate is stopped. Unfortunately, the rope suddenly breaks, and the crate then slides back down the ramp. Half-way down, it hits another crate of mass m = 20 kg, which is initially at rest. i. If the two crates stick together, how fast do they move just after the collision? [7] ii. How much energy is dissipated during the collision? [3] A37390 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 7. EITHER (Part A) (a) The equation for light refracted from a glass surface, of radius of curvature r, when incident from air is 1 s + ng s′ = ng − 1 r , where ng is the refractive index of the glass, s and s′ are the object and image distance from the glass surface and it is assumed the refractive index of air, na = 1. Show that lens formula for a thin lens is given by 1 s + 1 s′ = 1 f . [8] (b) What is the radius of curvature of a biconcave diverging lens (both surfaces are concave), which has equal magnitude radii of curvature for both faces, with a focal length of -20 cm? The refractive index of the glass from which the lens is constructed is ng = 1.4. [4] (c) An object is placed 10 cm to the left of the lens in part (b). Where is the image formed and what is the magniﬁcation? Sketch a ray diagram. [6] (d) A converging lens, of focal length 20 cm, is placed to the right of the diverging lens in part (b). Where must this second lens be placed, with respect to the ﬁrst lens, to create a real image 40 cm away from the second lens? What is the overall magniﬁcation? Draw the ray diagram for the two lens system. [7] A37390 Page 6 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR (Part B) (a) By considering the transverse displacement y of a string of mass per unit length µ, held under tension T along the x-axis, derive the wave-equation ∂2y ∂x2 = µ T ∂2y ∂t2 . You may assume that the displacement y is small and small-angle approximations apply. [8] (b) A string is held under tension T and has a length L. The mass per unit length has a form µ(x) = µ0 [(2L − x)/L] . Derive an expression for the length of time an impulse starting at x = 0 takes to reach the point x = L. [9] (c) Two strings of length L, but different masses per unit length, are joined together and held under tension T . The mass per unit length of string 1, µ1, is 4 times the mass per unit length of that of string 2, µ2. An impulse is started at the left hand end of string 1 and travels across the join to the right hand end of string 2, whose end is held ﬁxed. The reﬂected impulse then returns along the two-string system. If the amplitude of the initial impulse is A, what is the amplitude of the ﬁrst two pulses to be reﬂected to the left end of string 1?

Show that the maximum kinetic energy of the electron after scattering is given by Tmax = E2 E + mec2 2 . You may use without proof the Compton equation for the shift in the wavelength, δλ, of a photon scattered through an angle θ from a free electron: δλ = h mec (1 − cos θ) . [8] ii. When E ≫ mec2 show that the minimum energy of the scattered photon tends to a constant value. Express that value in units of keV. [5] iii. If visible light were scattered from free electrons, explain whether the shift in wavelength would be observable to the human eye. [2] (b) i. When 30 eV electrons are incident upon a crystalline silicon sample, peaks in scattered intensity are observed as the crystal is rotated. If the largest angle between the incident and scattered beams at which a peak is observed is 138 degrees, calculate the lattice spacing and ﬁnd the angles at which all further peaks in the scattered intensity would be observed. [8] ii. What photon energy would give rise to peaks in the scattered intensity at the same angles?

Using the TISE as an example, explain the terms eigenvalue equation, eigenfunction and eigenvalue and identify the operators in the equation. [5] (b) A particle of mass m is bound in an inﬁnite one-dimensional potential well, which has potential V (x) = 0 in the region 0 ≤ x ≤ L and V (x) = ∞ elsewhere. i. Show that the spatial wave function ψ(x) = A sin(kx) is a solution of the time independent Schr ¨odinger equation inside the well. Hence ﬁnd an expression for the total energy of the particle E in terms of the wave number k. [3] ii. State and explain the boundary condition that the wave function must satisfy at the boundaries of the well. Hence show that there are an inﬁnite number of bound states in the well and ﬁnd an expression for the allowed values of k in terms of the width of the well. [6] iii. Find the expectation value of the momentum of the particle inside the well and hence show that it is the same for any state. Explain the physical signiﬁcance of the value you obtain. [5] (c) Now consider a particle of mass m that is bound in a ﬁnite one-dimensional potential well, which has potential V (x) = 0 in the region 0 ≤ x ≤ L and V (x) = V0 elsewhere, where V0 is a positive constant. i. Sketch the probability density distribution of the ground state (lowest) energy solution, indicating the expected functional form in different regions of x. [4] ii. What can you say about the energy of the ground state in the ﬁnite well compared to an inﬁnite well of the same width? (Hint: consider how the ground state wave function changes as V0 → ∞.)
