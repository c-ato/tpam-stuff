The energy of an oscillator is E = 1 Year 1 Semester 2 Mathematics 2024-2025 Maths for Physicists 1B Assessed Problem 1 The function f (x, y) = x2 − y2 where x = u sec v and y = u tan v. (a) Evaluate the partial derivatives ∂f ∂x , ∂f ∂y , ∂x ∂u , ∂x ∂v , ∂y ∂u , ∂y ∂v , and write the results in terms of u and v. [3] (b) By direct evaluation of both sides of each equation, prove that ∂f ∂u = ∂f ∂x ∂x ∂u + ∂f ∂y ∂y ∂u and ∂f ∂v = ∂f ∂x ∂x ∂v + ∂f ∂y ∂y ∂v . [7] Classical Mechanics and Special Relativity 2 Assessed Problem 1 (a) A muon lives for 2 x 10-6 s before decaying, as measured in its rest frame. The muon is created in the upper atmosphere and moves towards the Earth at a speed of 0.99c. From the point of view of an observer on Earth, how far does the muon travel before it decays? (b) GPS satellites use precise clocks to locate where they are relative to Earth. A satellite in orbit moves at 10,000 km/h relative to the Earth’s surface. - By how much time per day would a failure to take the effects of special relativity into account make the clock incorrect? - How far would the satellite travel in this time as measured by an observer on the Earth?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
