{"path":"ec summative 6.pdf","text":"Year 1 Assessed Problems 6.pdf In the circuit below, find the initial and finitial values of the voltage across the 3 kΩ resistor after the switch, S, is closed. Find the initial and finitial values of the power dissipated in the network. There exists a path with 0Ω so all current takes that path so no current across the 3kΩ 1. In the circuit shown above, what is the initial voltage across the 3 kΩ resistor immediately after the switch S is closed? [2 points] 2. In the circuit shown above, what is the initial voltage across the 3 kΩ resistor after the switch S has been closed for a long time? [2 points] 3 4 ⋅ 28 = 21V 3. In the circuit shown above, what is the initial power dissipated in the network immediately after the switch S is closed? [3 points] For all resistors, the V = 0 ∴ P = 0W 4. In the circuit shown above, what is the initial power dissipated in the network after the switch S has been closed for a long time? [3 points] 72 1k + 212 3k = 196mW","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
