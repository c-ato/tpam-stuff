R eq= R1 R2 R1+R2 = 8x8 8+8 =64 16 =4  Find the equivalent resistance of the resulting parallel combination. R eq= R1 R2 R1+R2 = (16+8)´ ( 4+8 ) (16+8 )+(4 +8 )=24´ 12 24+12 =288 36 =8 (b) If the potential difference between a and b is 16 V, the total current is I = V Req = 16 8 =2A The current in each branch may be found using the current splitter theorem. I A= I R2 R1+ R2 =2 ( 4+8) ( 4+8 )+( 16+8 )=2 12 36 = 2 3 A Therefore, the current series combination of a 16  resistor and a 8  resistor is 2/3 A. I 2= I R1 R1+R2=2 ´ (16+8 ) ( 4+8 )+(16+8 )=2 ´ 24 36 = 4 3 A or applying Kirchhoff’s current law at node a I 2= I −I 1=2− 2 3 = 4 3 A Therefore the current through the series 8  resistor is 4/3 A. Since the current is split equally by the parallel combination of two 8  resistors, the current in each of the resistors is 2/3 A.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
