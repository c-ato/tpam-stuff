Solution: Since A = 2(1) − 5(1) 2(1) − 5(2) 2(2) − 5(1) 2(2) − 5(2) ) = −3 −8 −1 −6 ) it follows that |A| = (−3)(−6) − (−8)(−1) = 18 − 8 = 10. ■ (A) Question 3.

Solution: (a) |A| = 2.1.(−4) = −8 since A is upper triangular (i.e. |A| is the product of the terms on the diagonal). (b) |A| = 0 since columns 1 and 3 in A are equal. ■ (A) Question 7.

A diagonal matrix D = [dij] in M44(R) has integer entries and |D| = 12. Find all possible values of d22 and d44 if d11 = 3 and d33 = 1. Solution: Every diagonal matrix D ∈ M44(R) satisﬁes |D| = d11d22d33d44. Since for these diagonal matrix in question, 12 = d11d22d33d44 = 3d22d44 ⇐⇒ 4 = d22d44. Also, since d22, d44 ∈ Z it follows that (d22, d44) ∈ {(1, 4), (−1, −4), (4, 1), (−4, −1) (2, 2), (−2, −2)} ⊂ Z 2. ■ (A) Question 9. Let A, B ∈ Mnn(R). Prove, using determinants, that A·B is invertible iﬀ A and B are invertible. Solution: Recall that for A ∈ Mnn(R) we have A−1 exists iﬀ |A| ̸= 0, and, |A · B| = |A||B|. Therefore, (A · B) −1 exists ⇐⇒ |A · B| ̸= 0 ⇐⇒ |A||B| ̸= 0 ⇐⇒ |A| ̸= 0 and |B| ̸= 0. ⇐⇒ A −1 exists and B−1 exists, as required. ■ 4 1VGLA: DETERMINANTS PRACTICE QUESTIONS (A) Question 10. Let A and B be invertible matrices in Mnn(R). Determine the value of det(A · B · A−1 · B−1). Recall, matrix multiplication in Mnn(R) is not commutative. Solution: Recall that |A−1| = |A| −1. Then, we have |A · B · A−1 · B−1| = |A||B||A−1||B−1| = |A||B| 1 |A| 1 |B| = 1. Note that we use associative and commutative properties of multiplication of real numbers in the last equality. ■ (A) Question 11.

Find the value of |A| without calculating the elements of A. (a) A = E[2,−4] · E(2,3,−3) · E(1,3,2) · E[3, 1 2 ] · E(2,3) · E(2,1,−4) · E[1,−1] · E(1,3), (b) A = E(2,1,√5) · E(2,3) · E[3,√3] · E(2,3, 5 11 ) · E[2, 7√ 3 ] · E(2,11,− √11) · E[3,−2] · E(1,3,11). Recall that • E[i,λ] is the elementary matrix which multiplies row i by λ; • E(i,j) is the elementary matrix which swaps rows i and j; and • E(i,j,λ) is the elementary matrix which adds λ times row j to row i. Solution: Now, we have, (a) |A| = ∣ ∣ ∣E[2,−4] · E(2,3,−3) · E(1,3,2) · E[3, 1 2 ] · E(2,3) · E(2,1,−4) · E[1,−1] · E(1,3)∣ ∣ ∣ = |E[2,−4]||E(2,3,−3)||E(1,3,2)||E[3, 1 2 ]||E(2,3)||E(2,1,−4)||E[1,−1]||E(1,3)| = (−4)(1)(1) ( 1 2 ) (−1)(1)(−1)(−1) = 2 1VGLA: DETERMINANTS PRACTICE QUESTIONS 5 (b) |A| = |E(2,1,√5) · E(2,3) · E[3,√3] · E(2,3, 5 11 ) · E[2, 7√3 ] · E(2,11,−√11) · E[3,−2] · E(1,3,11)| = 14. ■ (A) Question 13. A matrix A ∈ Mnn(R) is called an orthogonal matrix if A · AT = AT · A = In. List all elements of the set S = {x ∈ R : n ∈ N, A ∈ Mnn(R) is an orthogonal matrix and |A| = x} . Solution: For any orthogonal matrix A · AT = In =⇒ |A||AT | = |In| =⇒ |A| 2 = 1. Therefore, S ⊂ {−1, 1}. For n ∈ N, the matrix In is an orthogonal matrix with |In| = 1. Moreover, for odd n ∈ N, the matrix −In is an orthogonal matrix with | − In| = −1. Hence, S = {−1, 1}. ■ (A) Question 14.

(b) Since |A| = 6, |A1| = 48 and |A2| = 30 it follows from Cramer’s rule that x = 48 6 = 8 and y = 30 6 = 5.

(b) Since |A| = −10, |A1| = −11, |A2| = −16 and |A3| = 1 it follows from Cramer’s rule that x = −11 −10 = 11 10, y = −16 −10 = 8 5 and z = 1 −10 = − 1 10. ■ (A) Question 17. Determine whether or not the following homogeneous systems have non-trivial solutions. You do not need to ﬁnd these solutions if they exist!

To clarify, consider A ∈ M23(R) given by (1 0 0 0 1 0 ) , for which the induced linear system has non-trivial solutions but A does not have a determinant. ■ (B) Question 19. For σ ∈ Sn with N (σ) > 0, establish that there exists i ∈ Σn such that σ(i) > σ(i + 1). Solution: Suppose that there does not exist i ∈ Σn such that σ(i) > σ(i + 1). Then 1 ≤ σ(1) ≤ σ(2) ≤ σ(3) ≤ . . . ≤ σ(n − 1) ≤ σ(n) ≤ n. Since σ is a bijection from Σn to Σn it follows that σ(i) = i for i = 1, . . . , n and hence N (σ) = 0, which is a contradiction.

Therefore |A − λI3| = 0 ⇐⇒ λ ∈ {1, 2, 3}. (b) |A − λI3| = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 − λ 2 −3 0 −4 − λ 0 7 8 9 − λ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = −(λ + 4)(−1)2+2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 − λ −3 7 9 − λ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = −(λ + 4)((1 − λ)(9 − λ) + 21) = −(λ + 4)(λ2 − 10λ + 30). Since the roots of (λ2 − 10λ + 30) are given by λ± = 10 ± (100 − 120) 1/2 2 = 5 ± √5i, it follows that |A − λI3| = 0 ⇐⇒ λ ∈ {−4, 5 + √5i, 5 − √5i}. ■ (B) Question 24. Let A, P ∈ Mnn(R) with P invertible. Prove that (a) det(P −1 · A · P) = det(A), (b) det(P −1 · A · P − λIn) = det(A − λIn) for any λ(̸= 0) ∈ R. It may be helpful to write λIn as P −1 · (λIn) · P. (c) If A =   b + c c − a b − a c − b c + a a − b b − c a − c a + b    and P =    −1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1    ﬁnd P −1 and then directly calculate P−1 · A · P. Hence ﬁnd |A|. Solution: (a) The result follows from |P−1 · A · P| = |P −1||A||P| = 1 |P| |A||P| = |A|. 1VGLA: DETERMINANTS PRACTICE QUESTIONS 11 (b) Since λIn = P−1 · (λIn) · P, it follows (using the distributive property) that |P−1 · A · P − λIn| = |P −1 · A · P − P −1 · (λIn) · P| = |P −1 · (A − λIn) · P| = |P −1||A − λIn||P| = 1 |P||P||A − λIn| = |A − λIn|. This calculation establishes that similar matrices have the same eigenvalues (see Chapter 10). (c) It follows that P −1 =   0 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 0    , and P −1 · A · P =   0 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 0    ·   b + c c − a b − a c − b c + a a − b b − c a − c a + b    ·    −1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1    =    2a 0 0 0 2b 0 0 0 2c    . Therefore, |A| = |P−1 · A · P| = 8abc. ■ (B) Question 25. (a) If A ∈ Mnn(R), ﬁnd a set S of cardinality less than 4 which contains the possible real numbers det(A) in each of the following cases? (i) A4 = In, (ii) A3 = A, (iii) A2 = −A with n odd. (iv) A2 = −A with n even. (b) Does there exist a matrix A ∈ M33(R) such that A 2 = −I3? Justify your answer. Solution: (a) (i) A4 = In =⇒ |A| 4 − 1 = 0 =⇒ |A| ∈ {−1, 1}. Therefore, let S = {−1, 1}. (ii) A3 = A =⇒ |A| 3 − |A| = 0 ⇐⇒ |A|(|A| 2 − 1) = 0 ⇐⇒ |A| ∈ {−1, 0, 1}. Therefore, let S = {−1, 0, 1}. (iii) If n is odd, then A2 = −A =⇒ |A| 2 + |A| = 0 ⇐⇒ |A|(|A| + 1) = 0 ⇐⇒ |A| ∈ {−1, 0}. Therefore, let S = {−1, 0}. (iv) If n is even, then A 2 = −A =⇒ |A| 2 − |A| = 0 ⇐⇒ |A|(1 − |A|) = 0 ⇐⇒ |A| ∈ {0, 1}. Therefore, let S = {0, 1}. (b) No, since such a matrix would satisfy |A| 2 = | − I3| = −1 which has no real solutions. ■ (B) Question 26. Let A, B ∈ Mnn(R). Prove that (a) det(A · B) = det(B · A), (b) det(AT + B) = det(A + BT ). Recall that matrix multiplication in Mnn(R) is not commutative and (P+Q) T = P T +Q T . Solution: (a) Since multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation, it follows that |A · B| = |A||B| = |B||A| = |B · A|. 12 1VGLA: DETERMINANTS PRACTICE QUESTIONS (b) From the hint, it follow that |AT + B| = |(AT + B) T | = |(AT ) T + BT | = |A + BT |. ■ (B) Question 27. Is the following argument acceptable as an answer to the following question which was (apparently) set on an examination paper? Question: “Prove that if A is a skew-symmetric matrix in Mnn(R) with n an odd positive integer, then det(A) = 0.” (Recall that A is skew-symmetric if AT = −A.) Answer: “Let A =    0 a b −a 0 c −b −c 0    where a, b, c ∈ R. Then by expanding elements of row 1 with cofactors, det(A) = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 0 a b −a 0 c −b −c 0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = (−a) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣−a c −b 0 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ + b ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣−a 0 −b −c ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = −abc + abc = 0. ′′ If you decide that the argument above is not acceptable as an answer, state why not and then give an argument which proves that the statement in the question is true. Solution: This proof is not valid since it only establishes the result when n = 3. To prove the result, let A ∈ Mnn(R) be a skew-symmetric matrix for odd n ∈ N. Then, A T = −A =⇒ |AT | = | − A| ⇐⇒ |A| = −|A| ⇐⇒ |A| = 0. Note that if n was even then | − A| = |A|. ■ (B) Question 28. Using Cramer’s rule, ﬁnd (a) x such that    w + x + y + z = 3 7w + 3x − y + z = 1 2w − 2x − 3y + 3z = 4 w + x + y + 8z = 7 (b) z such that    −w − 2x + y + z = 3 w − x + 2y − 2z = −1 −2w − x + + z = 1 2w + 2x + − 3z = 0 Solution: (a) Observe that |A| = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 1 1 1 7 3 −1 1 2 −2 −3 3 1 1 1 8 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 1 1 1 7 3 −1 1 2 −2 −3 3 0 0 0 7 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = 7(−1)4+4 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 1 1 7 3 −1 2 −2 −3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = 7((−9 − 2) − (−21 + 2) + (−14 − 6)) = 7(−11 + 19 − 20) 1VGLA: DETERMINANTS PRACTICE QUESTIONS 13 = −84 and |A2| = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 3 1 1 7 1 −1 1 2 4 −3 3 1 7 1 8 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 1 3 1 1 0 −20 −8 −6 0 −2 −5 1 0 4 0 7 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = 1(−1) 1+1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ −20 −8 −6 −2 −5 1 4 0 7 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ = 4(−1) 1+3(−8 − 30) + 7(−1) 3+3(100 − 16) = −152 + 588 = 436. Therefore, by Cramer’s rule x = |A2| |A| = 436 −84 = −109 21 . (b) Here |A| = −1 and |A4| = 14. Therefore, by Cramer’s rule z = 14 −1 = −14. Note that exact steps one uses to calculate a determinant is not limited to the approach above. There are most likely more eﬃcient ways to perform these calculations which depend on each individual matrix. ■ (B) Question 29. Read the question below and then study the given ‘suggested’ answer with a view to deciding if this answer is correct. If you conclude that the ‘suggested’ answer is wrong, then produce a correct answer. Question: Decide whether the following statement is true or false. “If A and B are any two matrices in M22(R), then det(A + B) = det(A) + det(B). ′′ Give a proof if you conclude that the statement is true or a counterexample if you think it is false. Answer: The statement is true. Let A = ( 1 1 1 2 ) and B = ( 1 3 3 4 ) . Then det(A) = 2 − 1 = 1, det(B) = 4 − 9 = −5 and hence, det(A) + det(B) = −4. Also A + B = (2 4 4 6 ) =⇒ det(A + B) = 12 − 16 = −4. Hence det(A + B) = det(A) + det(B) for all A, B ∈ M22(R). Solution: The given answer is incorrect since it only establishes that the result holds for the 2 matrices considered. The statement is false. A suﬃcient counter-example is given by A = I2 and B = −I2, since, |A| = |B| = 1 and |A + B| = |0| = 0 ̸= 2 = |A| + |B|. ■ (C) Question 30. A matrix A = [aij] ∈ Mnn(R) with n ≥ 2 is such that aij = 0 if i + j < n + 1. Establish that |A| = (−1)ka1,na2,n−1 . . . an−1,2an,1 and k = n(n−1) 2 . 14 1VGLA: DETERMINANTS PRACTICE QUESTIONS Solution: It follows from deﬁnition of aij that |A| = ∑ σ∈Sn(−1) N (σ) n∏ i=1 aσ(i)i = (−1) N (σ∗) n∏ i=1 aσ∗(i)i where σ∗(i) = n + 1 − i for i = 1, . . . , n (since the upper left triangle in the matrix, above the diagonal, consists of only zeros). Since σ∗ has ∑n−1 i=1 i inversions, it follows that |A| = (−1)k n∏ i=1 an+1−i,i = (−1) kan,1an−1,2an−2,3 . . . a2,n−1a1,n. You can alternatively obtain this result by swapping rows to convert the matrix into diag- onal form. ■ (C) Question 31. Establish that if A ∈ M33(R) is the matrix A =   b + c a2 a c + a b2 b a + b c2 c    then |A| = −(a − b)(b − c)(c − a)(a + b + c). Deduce the conditions on a, b and c under which the system (b + c)x + a 2y + az = a3, (c + a)x + b2y + bz = b3, (a + b)x + c2y + cz = c3 of three linear equations in three unknowns possesses a unique solution. Solution: The determinant can be computed directly. The system of linear equations has a unique solution precisely when |A| ̸= 0 i.e. when a ̸= b ̸= c ̸= a and (a + b + c) ̸= 0. ■ (C) Question 32. For some ﬁxed k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, let A = [aij], B = [bij], C = [cij] ∈ Mnn(R) be given by bij =   aij, j ̸= k bik, j = k, cij =   aij j ̸= k cik j = k, and aik = bik + cik, for i = 1, . . . , n. Prove that |A| = |B| + |C|. Solution: Observe that the 3 matrices have the same entries, except in column k. There- fore, |A| = ∑ σ∈Sn(−1) N (σ) n∏ i=1 aσ(i)i = ∑ σ∈Sn(−1) N (σ)     n∏ i=1 i̸=k aσ(i)i     (bσ(k)k + cσ(k)k) =     ∑ σ∈Sn(−1) N (σ)     n∏ i=1 i̸=k aσ(i)i     (bσ(k)k)     +     ∑ σ∈Sn(−1) N (σ)     n∏ i=1 i̸=k aσ(i)i     (cσ(k)k)     =   ∑ σ∈Sn(−1) N (σ) n∏ i=1 bσ(i)i   +   ∑ σ∈Sn(−1) N (σ) n∏ i=1 cσ(i)i   = |B| + |C|. ■","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
