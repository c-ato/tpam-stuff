Find a shorthand method of determining the response of such circuit. • Material to be covered Inductors – basic equations. Response to instantaneous changes in voltage or current. Week 06: Inductors EC_Week06.3 Inductors – basic equations EC_Week06.4 Transient behaviour - inductors EC_Week06.5 Initial and final response EC_Week06.6 General solution for RC/RL circuits EC_Week06.7 Let’s check this general method Case 1. Current increasing. The initial value of iL = 0, since the current cannot change instantaneously. The final value of vL = V/R, since the inductor behaves like a short-circuit. The time constant is L/R. Inserting these values into the shorthand equation we obtain Case 2: Current decreasing. In the initial value of iL = V/R, equal to current just before the source was removed. The final value of iL = 0, since there are no other sources present. The time constant is L/R, as before. Inserting these values into the shorthand equation we obtain i L= V R +(0− V R )e − Rt L ⇒ i L= V R ( 1−e − Rt L ) i L=0+( V R −0)e − Rt L ⇒ i L= V R e − Rt L EC_Week06.8 Summary of Week 06 material Further Reading: Tipler 28-1: Magnetic flux. Tipler 28-2: Induced EMF and Faraday's law. Tipler 28-3: Lenz's law. Tipler 28-6: Inductance (self-inductance). Tipler 28-7: Magnetic energy. Tipler 28-8: RL circuits. At the end of these week you should be able to: 1. State the basic equations for inductors. 2. Recognise that inductors behave like an o/c to sudden current changes and like a s/c to steady voltages. 3. Obtain expressions for i(t) for RL circuits.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
