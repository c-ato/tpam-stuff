Think in terms of forces Attractive force between atoms < Force applied to material ⅆ𝐹 ⅆ𝑟 = 0 ⇒ 𝐹 = 𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥 If we pull with a force greater than 𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥 continuously, we will pull the atoms apart –> material breaks Breaking stress Can define a maximum sustainable stress based on the maximum attractive force from LJ over the area of a single atom or molecule: Breaking stress = 𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑟0 2 Can calculate both 𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥 and hence the breaking stress from LJ: 𝛤 = 6 13 7 𝑟0 𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 2.64𝜀 𝑟0 Breaking stress = 0.037 𝑌 = 𝐹𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑘 𝐴 = 𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑟0 2 Macroscopic Microscopic Example Q: A wire of aluminium has a Young’s modulus of 70 GPa and a cross- sectional area of 0.5 mm2 – how much force could you theoretically apply before you break it? A: 1295 Newtons (high!) In reality we probably expect a little lower than this due to the force not being applied equally and consistently across the whole material (due to imperfections, for example)F Fractures Stress increases if there is a crack in the material by a factor of 1 + 2 ⅆ 𝑟 https://metallurgyandmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/liberty-ship-failure.jpg Liberty ship fractures – not well understood that ductile steel could also split in half even during WWII Force 2r d Force increases with decreasing r -> atomic length scales cause huge increase in stress Force decreases with increasing d -> deeper grooves worse (makes sense)https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/worker-cuts-paving-slabs-with-gas-cutter-hand-saw_140282-63.jpg https://www.trirentall.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shutterstock_2059472675.jpg Summary Discussed Young’s modulus (macroscopic) using microscopic ideas Investigated the maximum force and breaking force that materials can undergo Discussed the physics of fractures and how these deviate from our understanding from a basic LJ interpretation","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
