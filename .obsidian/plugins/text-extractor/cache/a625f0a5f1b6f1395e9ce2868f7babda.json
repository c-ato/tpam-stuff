Fifteen measurements of the volume of a block of aluminium gave the corresponding results 8.72cm 3 and 0.058cm 6. If the densities of iron and aluminium are 7.88gcm −3 and 2.70gcm −3, respectively, what is the best estimate of the total mass of the two blocks and the corresponding error in the measurement? Exercise 2: Six measurements of the length of a wire had a mean value of 527.3cm with mean square deviation 0.01cm 2. Twelve measurements of its diameter had a mean value of 0.062cm with a mean square deviation of 1.2 × 10−6cm 2. If the resistivity is known to be 44.2 × 10−6 Ωcm, what is the best estimate of the resistance of the wire and the corresponding error in the measurement?
