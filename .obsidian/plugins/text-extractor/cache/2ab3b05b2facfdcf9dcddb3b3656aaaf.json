We start with a summary of what we found last week. 2 Summary The position vector of a particle is given by r = rer, = r cos θi + r sin θj. The velocity of the particle is therefore ˙r = r ˙θeθ + ˙rer. The acceleration is thus ¨r = (¨r − r ˙θ2) er + 1 r d dt (r2 ˙θ) eθ. For a outward pointing central force, F (r)er, u = 1/r satisfies d2u dθ2 + u = −F (1/u) mh2u2 , with h = r2 ˙θ constant throughout the motion. We also have ˙r = −hdu dθ . (1) 1 3 Examples Example 1: Motion under a 1/r2 central force Typical orbit problems often have an inverse square law central force. Let F (r) = −GM m r2 , so we have a gravitational force between two bodies of mass M and m (e.g. the sun and a planet), with initial conditions r = d, θ = 0, specifying location at t = 0, ˙r = 0, r ˙θ = v specifying radial and transverse velocity components at t = 0. Note the negative sign as the force is directed inwards. Solution. We know d2u dθ2 + u = −F (1/u) mh2u2 , where u = 1/r always holds for a central force. Here F (r) is of the form F (r) = −GM m r2 , and hence F (1/u) = −GM m (1/u) 2 , = −GM mu2. This gives d2u dθ2 + u = −−GM mu2 mh2u2 , = GM h2 . We first find h from initial conditions (since it is a constant, it is the initial value for all time). It’s normally a good idea to find the value of h as early as possible! Now, h = r2 ˙θ, = r · r ˙θ, = dv, 2 at t = 0, and hence for all time. Thus we need to solve d 2u dθ2 + u = GM d2v2 . This is a linear second order ODE with constant coefficients, so we use the standard method to solve it. Start with the homogeneous equation: d2uc dθ2 + uc = 0, which has characteristic equation λ2 + 1 = 0, =⇒ λ = ±i, and hence =⇒ uc = A sin θ + B cos θ, where A and B are constants to be found from the initial conditions. The particular integral is given by up = C, =⇒ C = GM d2v2 , giving the full solution u = A sin θ + B cos θ + GM d2v2 . We now need to find A, B using the initial conditions. We first need to rewrite these in terms of u(θ)instead of r(t). Firstly r = d gives u = 1/r = 1/d, and ˙r = −hdu dθ , = 0, =⇒ du dθ = 0. Since θ = 0 at t = 0, both of these hold for θ = 0 so they become r = d, du dθ = 0 at θ = 0. 3 Hence u (0) = B + GM d2v2 , = 1 d, =⇒ B = 1 d − GM d2v2 , and du dθ = A cos θ − B sin θ, = A at θ = 0, = 0. This gives the complete solution u = ( 1 d − GM d2v2 ) cos θ + GM d2v2 . What shape is this? We have r = 1 u, = 1 ( 1 d − GM d2v2 ) cos θ + GM d2v2 , = d2v2/GM ( dv2 GM − 1 ) cos θ + 1 . Firstly note that if dv2 GM = 1 this gives a circle (i.e. r =constant). A general conic with focus at (0, 0) has a polar representation r (θ) = e ˆd 1 ± e cos θ , where x = ˆd is the directrix ( ˆd > 0) and e is the eccentricity such that • 0 < e < 1 gives an ellipse, • e = 1 gives a parabola, • e > 1 gives a hyperbola. (See the crib sheet for more details.) Hence we have ±e = dv2 GM − 1, 4 which implies we require ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ dv2 GM − 1 ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ < 1, for the path to be an ellipse. Hence −1 < dv2 GM − 1 < 1, =⇒ (0 <) dv2 GM < 2, =⇒ v2 < 2GM d . So we have an elliptical orbit depending on the mass of the sun and the initial distance and velocity of the planet - this gives Kepler’s first rule.

The particle is initially a distance a from the origin and moving with velocity √α/a perpendicular to the radial vector. What are the maximum and minimum distances between the particle and the origin, and what angle is turned through by the radius vector in travelling between them? Solution. We have that u = 1/r satisfies d2u dθ2 + u = −F (1/u) mh2u2 , = αu2 + βu3 h2u2 , where h = r2 ˙θ is a constant. Hence d2u dθ2 + ( 1 − β h2 ) u = α h2 , will give the shape of the path. We next consider the initial conditions. We choose θ = 0 at t = 0, and from the problem statement we have 5 • r = a at t = 0 from the initial location of the particle. • ˙r = 0, r ˙θ = √α/a at t = 0 from the radial and transverse velocity components. We first calculate h such that h = r · r ˙θ, = a · √ α/a, = √αa. We next convert the initial conditions into terms of u (θ) to give • u = 1/r = 1/a at θ = 0. • du dθ = − ˙r/h = 0 at θ = 0. Hence d2u dθ2 + ( 1 − β h2 ) u = α h2 , =⇒ d2u dθ2 + ( 1 − β αa ) u = α αa , =⇒ d 2u dθ2 + ( 1 − 1 2 ) u = 1 a, =⇒ d2u dθ2 + u 2 = 1 a, since β = αa/2. This is a second order, linear ODE with constant coefficients, so we pro- ceed as before, starting by solving the homogeneous system, which will have characteristic equation: λ 2 + 1 2 = 0, and hence λ = ±i/√2 and thus uc = A cos θ √2 + B sin θ √2, where A and B are constants. The particular integral is then of the form up = C is constant, hence 1 2 C = 1 a, =⇒ up = 2 a. 6 The complete solution is thus u = A cos θ √2 + B sin θ √2 + 2 a. Finally, we use the initial conditions to find the values of A and B, such that u(0) = A + 2 a , = 1 a, =⇒ A = − 1 a, and du dθ = − A √2 sin θ √ 2 + B √2 cos θ √2, so evaluating this at θ = 0 gives du dθ = B √2 = 0, =⇒ B = 0. This gives the solution u = 2 a − 1 a cos θ √2. We want to find the maximum and the minimum distances, so the maximum and minimum values of r. This is equivalent to minimum and maximum u. • Minimum u (maximum r) is when cos θ √ 2 = 1, so θ = 0. Hence u = 1/a, and r = a. • Maximum u (minimum r) is when cos θ √2 = −1, so θ = √ 2π. Hence u = 3/a, and r = a/3. The angle turned through in the difference in these values of θ, i.e. √ 2π.
