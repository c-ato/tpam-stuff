Find the lowest electron accelerating voltage at which constructive interference will occur at an angle of 20 ◦ from the crystal planes. [8] 2. A photon of wavelength 13.5 nm is emitted when a single-electron atom makes a transition from its first excited state. How much energy is required to ionise the atom from its ground state? Express your answer in units of eV. What is the atomic number Z of the atom? [8] 3. The transverse displacement y at position x and time t of a harmonic wave on a string is given by y = 0.006 sin(0.1x − 2.2t + 0.1), where x and y are measured in metres while t is measured in seconds. Find the amplitude, wavelength, frequency and period of this wave. Use the above equation to show that this wave travels in the +x direction. What is the speed of this wave? [8] 4. Two taut strings of the same mass per unit length and held at the same tension are 2.10 m and 2.12 m long, respectively. The ends of each string are fixed. Given that the speed of waves along the strings is 1000 m s−1, what is the fundamental frequency of each string? Describe what is heard when both strings are oscillating at their fundamental frequencies. [8] A37467 Page 2 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR SECTION 2 Answer both questions in this Section. Note that each question has two parts, of which only one part should be answered. If you answer both parts, credit will only be given for the best answer. 5. EITHER Part A (a) Using the time-independent Schr ¨odinger equation (TISE) as an example, explain the terms eigenvalue equation, eigenfunction and eigenvalue. Identify the operators in the TISE. [4] (b) When the potential function takes a constant positive value, V (x) = V0, show that the wave function ψ(x) = A exp(ikx) is an eigenfunction of the TISE, and determine its eigenvalue. [2] (c) A particle of mass, m, and energy, E, moving in the positive x-direction is incident upon a semi-infinite positive potential step at x = 0. The potential function is V (x) = 0 for x < 0 and V (x) = V0 for x ≥ 0. The solution of the TISE in the region x < 0 is ψ(x) = A exp(ikx) + B exp(−ikx). Consider the situation where E < V0. i. By solving the TISE, show that the wave function in the region x ≥ 0 is a real exponential of the form ψ(x) = C exp(−αx), where C and α are constants. Find an expression for α in terms of the other constants in the problem. [4] ii. Explain why the wave function, and the gradient of the wave function, must be continuous at the boundary at x = 0. Hence show that |A| 2 = |B| 2 and explain the significance of this result. [5] iii. By normalising the wave function in the region x ≥ 0, find an expression for the probability that a barrier-penetrating particle penetrates a depth x ≥ L into the potential step. [5] A37467 Page 3 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR Part B (a) Describe two features of the photoelectric effect that are inconsistent with classical physics. For each feature, state what classical physics predicts and how the photon hypothesis explains the result. [4] (b) When light of wavelength 200 nm is shone onto a metal surface the maximum electron energy is measured to be 2.41 eV. What is the maximum wavelength for which electrons will be emitted? [4] (c) The X-ray absorption spectrum of a particular element is found to have three absorption edges at 0.4 keV, 2.6 keV and 20 keV. i. Explain what the appearance of edges in the absorption spectrum tells you about the electronic structure of atoms. [4] ii. Use the data provided to find the atomic number of the element. [4] (d) Find the longest incident wavelength for which the energy of a photon can be halved in the process of Compton scattering. [4] A37467 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 6. EITHER Part A (a) An object 1 cm high is placed 70 cm in front of a thin converging lens of focal length 40 cm. Find the position and size of the image i. qualitatively using a ray diagram. ii. quantitatively using the lens equation. [4] (b) The experimental setup described in a) is moved from air into a large bath of water of refractive index 1.33. If the lens is made of plastic of refractive index 1.20, determine the position and size of the image using both a ray diagram and the lens equation. The focal length f of a lens of refractive index nl in the medium of refractive index nm is given by 1 f = ( nl nm − 1) ( 1 r1 − 1 r2 ) . [4] (c) Two thin lenses with focal lengths f1 and f2 are placed together to form a combination lens. Assuming that the distance between the two lenses is zero, show that the combined lens has an effective focal length f such that 1 f = 1 f1 + 1 f2 . [4] (d) A person has near point of 150 cm. What is the power of the contact lens that is required to bring this near point to 25 cm? [3] (e) A diver finds when looking up at the surface of the water that it is possible to observe light from above the water only in a circular region on the water’s surface. If the refractive index of the water is nw = 1.33, what is the opening angle of the cone which is defined by the diver’s eye and the circular region? You may assume that the medium above water is air with a refractive index nair = 1. What does the diver see outside the cone? [5] A37467 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR Part B Two semi-infinite strings of different mass per unit length, µ1 and µ2, are joined at the position x = 0. The tension in the strings is T . A wave, given by y = A cos(k1x − ωt) , travels along string 1 from left to right. (a) Show that the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves, C and B, respectively, are given by: B = 2k1 k1 + k2 A and C = k1 − k2 k1 + k2 A where k1 and k2 are the wave-numbers for strings 1 and 2, respectively. State the boundary conditions that you used for the derivation. [7] (b) What happens to the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves if i) µ2 tends to infinity and ii) µ2 tends to zero? [3] (c) For µ2 = 0, the resultant wave on string 1 can be obtained by superposition of the incident and the reflected waves. Express the resultant wave in terms of A, k1 and ω. Where is the first node from x = 0? [4] (d) For a particular combination of the two strings, C = (−A)/2 for the reflected wave. Assume that string 2 is infinitely long so that no reflected waves come from the right end of string 2, show that the resultant wave on string 1 can be expressed as the sum of a standing wave and a travelling wave. Are there any nodes on string 1 where the displacement is constantly zero? Comment on how energy transport from string 1 to string 2 is affected by the junction.
