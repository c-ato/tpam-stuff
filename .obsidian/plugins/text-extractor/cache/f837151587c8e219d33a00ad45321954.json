Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. No calculator is permitted in this examination. Page 1 Turn over No Calculator Section A 1.

[8] (e) This question involves the rotation transform given by x = ˜x cos(α) − ˜y sin(α) and y = ˜x sin(α) + ˜y cos(α) where the value of the rotation angle α is chosen to eliminate the cross term xy. Deter- mine an expression for −2x2 + 2 √ 3xy − 4 = 0 in ( ˜x, ˜y) coordinates and hence identify the type and eccentricity of this conic section.
