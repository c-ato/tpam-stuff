At t = t′ = 0 the axes of Σ and Σ′ coincide. This arrangement is called standard conﬁguration. t′ = γ(v)(t − vx/c2) x′ = γ(v)(x − vt) y′ = y z′ = z and t = γ(v)(t′ + vx′/c2) x = γ(v)(x′ + vt′) y = y′ z = z′ with γ(v) = 1 √ 1 − v2/c2 You should take c ≃ 3 × 108 m s−1 in any numerical calculations. 1. An event occurs at x′ = 60 m and t′ = 8 × 10−8 s in Σ′. Σ′ has a velocity 3c/5 relative to Σ. What are the space time coordinates of the event in Σ ? 2. The frame Σ′ has a velocity 0.6c relative to Σ. An event E1 occurs in Σ at t = 2 × 10−7 s at a point for which x = 50 m and a second event E2 occurs in Σ at t = 3 × 10−7 s and x = 10 m. What is the time interval between the events as measured in Σ′? 3. Verify that under a standard Lorentz Transformation (ct′) 2−r ′2 = (ct) 2 − r 2 and check that the Galilean Transformation does not satisfy this invariance relation. 4. Frames of reference Σ and Σ′ are in the usual standard conﬁguration with respect to each other and Σ′ moves to the right with velocity u along the common x − x′ axis. Two events E1 and E2 occur on the x axis of Σ, are separated in Σ by a distance L, and and observer at rest in Σ judges that event E2 occurs a time τ later than event E1. However in Σ′, an observer judges that event E2 occurs a time τ earlier than E1. Show that the two frames of reference have a relative velocity u = 2c2Lτ / (L2 + c2τ 2) 5. ⋆The diagram shows a rocket whose proper length is L0 and which moves to the right with a velocity u relative to a frame of reference Σ. The nose of the rocket can be taken as situated at the origin of an inertial frame of reference Σ′ which moves to the right with velocity u along the common x − x′ axis. An observer A′ at rest in the nose of the rocket passes an observer A who is at the origin of the frame of reference Σ and as they pass, their clocks are set to read 0. As A′ passes A, the observer A′ sends a ﬂash of light to an observer B′ sitting at the tail of the rocket. (a) At what time does A′ (who lives in the rocket) judge that the light ﬂash reaches B′? DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Example Sheet 1 (b) At what time does the observer A judge that the light ﬂash reaches the observer B′ sitting at the tail of the rocket? (c) At what time does A judge that the tail of the rocket passes A? 6. Two inertial frames of reference are in the usual standard conﬁguration with respect to each other and Σ′ moves to the right with velocity u with respect to Σ along the common x − x′ axis. An observer R at rest in Σ is situated on the x− axis at a point with coordinate x = a and an observer R′ who is at rest in Σ′ is situated at a point whose x′ coordinate has the same numerical value x′ = a as does observer R in Σ. E1 is the event that the origins of Σ and Σ′ pass and E2 is the event that R′ passes R. Show that these events are separated by the time interval of magnitude ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ a u ( 1 − √ 1 − u2 c2 )∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ but that the order in which these events occur is diﬀerent. 7. The positive muon µ+ is an unstable particle with a half life of about 2.2 × 10−6 s measured in the rest frame of the µ+. In an experiment in which the µ+ is caused to travel with a very high speed with respect to the laboratory, its lifetime in the laboratory is measured to be 1.9 × 10−5 s. Calculate the speed of the µ+ as a fraction of the velocity of light. . What distance in the laboratory does the muon travel during its lifetime? 8. This is purely an exercise in algebra. γ(u1) and γ(u2) are the usual γ factors appropriate to speeds u1 and u2 respectively. Show that γ(u1) γ(u2) = 1 (1 + u1u2/c2) √ 1 − [(u1 + u2) /(1 + u1u2/c2)] 2 /c2 ≡ 1 (1 + u1u2/c2) γ ( u1 + u2 1 + u1u2/c2 ) . 9. You will need to use the expression for γ(u1) γ(u2) derived in the previous question.The standard Lorentz Transformations relating the space time coordinates in inertial frames Σ and Σ′can be written as t′ = γ(u) (t − ux/c2) x′ = γ(u) (x − ut) An inertial frame of reference Σ1 has a velocity u1 relative to a frame Σ0 and a frame Σ2 has a velocity u2 relative to Σ1, show by making the appropriate substitutions for the space time coordinates that the eﬀect of performing two successive Lorentz Transformations with velocities u1 and u2 is the same as performing a single Lorentz Transformation with a velocity V = (u1 + u2)/(1 + u1u2/c2) . This result is the start of a proof that the set of Lorentz Transformations forms a group. If you are familiar with matrix algebra you might like to show that the Lorentz Trans- formations can be written in the equivalent form ( ct′ x′ ) = γ(u) ( 1 −u/c −u/c 1 ) ( ct x ) You can now use the process of matrix multiplication to establish the previous result. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Example Sheet 1 10. A source of light ﬂashes at time intervals τ0 in its own proper frame of reference. The source retreats from an observer with a velocity u which can be taken to be along the x-axis. Use the Lorentz Transformations to show that the observer receives these ﬂashes at time intervals τ = τ 0√ (1 + u/c) / (1 − u/c) . With what frequency does the observer receive these ﬂashes? What answers would you obtain if the Galilean rather than the Lorentz Transformations were used? Comment on your answers. 11. Inertial frames of reference Σ and Σ′ are in the usual standard conﬁguration with respect to each other and Σ′ moves to the right of Σ′ with velocity u along the common x − x′ axis. A ﬂash of light is emitted from a point with position x1 on the x axis and is absorbed at a point x2 = x1 + L. (a) What does an observer in Σ′ judge to be the spatial separation between the point of emission and the point of absorption of the ﬂash? (b) What does an observer in Σ′ judge to be the time interval between the emission and absorption of the ﬂash of light. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Solutions to Example Sheet 1 1. u/c = 3/5 then γ(u) = 1/ √ 1 − u2/c2 = 1/√ 1 − 9/25 = 5/4. Then since the space time coordinates of the event E in Σ′ are x′ = 10−8 s we use the (inverse) Lorentz Transformations in the form x = γ(u) (x′ + ut′) and t = γ(u) (t ′ + ux ′/c 2) . Inserting the numerical values gives x = 5 4 (60 + u c ct ′) = 5 4 ( 60 + 3 5 c × 8 × 10 −8) using c = 3 × 10 ms−1 gives x = 5 4 (60 + 3 5 × 3 × 8 × 10 8 × 10 −8) m x = 93m t = γ(u) (t ′ + ux ′/c 2) = 5 4 (8 × 10−8 + u c × 60 3 × 108 ) = 5 4 ( 8 × 10 −8 + 3 5 × 60 3 × 108 ) t = 5 4 × 10 −8 ( 8 + 180 15 ) = 5 4 × 10 −8 (8 + 12) = 25 × 10 −8s. In Σ the event occurs at x = 93m and t = 25 × 10−8s. 2. u/c = 3/5 and so γ(u) = 5/4 again. For the event E1 we are told that in frame Σ, x1 = 50 m and t1 = 2 × 10−7 s and for the event E2 we have so x2 = 10 m and t2 = 3 × 10−7 s and so we use the Lorentz Transformation in the form t ′ = γ(u) (t − ux/c 2) → t ′ 1 = γ(u) (t1 − ux1/c 2) and t ′ 2 = γ(u) (t2 − ux2/c 2) . Then t ′ 1 = 5 4 (2 × 10 −7 − 3 5 × 50 3 × 108 ) s = 5 4 (2 × 10 −7 − 10 108 ) s = 5 4 × 10 −7s t ′ 2 = 5 4 (3 × 10 −7 − 3 5 × 10 3 × 108 ) s = 5 4 (3 × 10 −7 − 1 5 × 10 108 ) s = 5 4 × (2.8) × 10 −7s The time interval in Σ′ is thus t′ 2 − t′ 1 = (5/4) × (2.8 − 1) × 10−7s = 2.25 × 10−7s. 3. Using the Lorentz transformation (ct ′)2 − (x′) 2 = γ2(u) ((ct − ux/c) 2 − (x − ut) 2) = γ2(u) ((ct) 2 − 2uxt + u 2x2/c 2 − x2 + 2uxt − u 2t2) = γ2(u) ((c 2 − u 2)t 2 − (1 − u 2/c 2)x 2)2 = (ct)2 − x2 . Since y = y′ and z = z′ then c 2t′2 − r′2 = c 2t 2 − r 2. The Galilean transformation is t′ = t and x′ = x − ut , y′ = y and z′ = z and so c 2t ′2 − r ′2 = c 2t2 − (x − ut)2 − y2 − z2 = c 2t 2 − x 2 − y2 − z2 + 2uxt − u 2t2. The right hand side is not c2t2 − x2 − y2 − z2 = c2t2 − r2 and has additional terms added in i.e. under a Galilean Transformation c2t′2 − r′2 ̸= c2t2 − r2. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Solutions to Example Sheet 1 4. Event E1 has coordinates (x1, t1) in Σ and (x′ 1, t′ 1) in Σ′. Event E2 has coordinates (x2, t2) in Σ and (x′ 2, t′ 2) in Σ′. Coordinates in the two frames are related by the standard Lorentz Transformation x ′ = γ(u) (x − ut) and t ′ = γ(u) (t − ux/c 2) In Σ event E2 occurs a time τ later than t1 and so t2 = t1 + τ and we are told that x2 = x1 + L. Thus since t′ 1 = γ(u) (t1 − ux1/c2) and t′ 2 = γ(u) (c − ux2/c2) we have t′ 2 − t′ 1 = γ(u) (t2 − t1 − u(x2 − x1) /c 2) = γ(u) (τ − uL) /c 2). But we are told that event E2 in Σ′ occurs at a time τ earlier than event E1 and so t′ 2 = t′ 1 − τ. Thus −τ = γ(u) (τ − uL) /c 2) → τ (γ(u) + 1) = γ(u)uL/c 2 or τ (1 + 1 γ(u) ) = uL c2 = τ (1 + √ 1 − u2/c2) Hence √ 1 − u2/c2 = uL τ c2 − 1 → 1 − u 2/c 2 = u2L2 τ 2c4 − 2uL τ c2 + 1. Thus u 2 ( 1 c2 + L2 τ 2c4 ) = 2uL τ c2 and either u = 0 (impossible) or u = 2Lτ c2 c2τ 2 + L2 . 5. (a) Light travels with the same speed c in both Σ′ and Σ and so in Σ′ the ﬂash leaves A′ at t′ = 0 and travels the proper distance L0 to the tail of the rocket which it does in a time L0/c. (b) The ﬂash is judged in Σ′ to leave the origin x′ = 0 at t′ = 0 and reach the point in Σ′ with coordinate x′ = −L0 at a time t′ = L0/c. To obtain the time coordinate t of the event that the ﬂash reaches the tail we use the inverse Lorentz Transformation t = γ(u) (t ′ + ux ′/c 2) with t′ = L0/c and x′ = −L0 and this gives t = γ(u) ( L0 c + u (−L0) c2 ) = γ(u) L0 c (1 − u c ) = L0 c (1 − u/c) √ 1 − u2/c2 = L0 c ( 1 − u/c) 1 + u/c )1/2 DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Solutions to Example Sheet 1 (c) In Σ, the length of the rocket is Lorentz contracted to a value L0√ 1 − u2/c2 = L0/γ(u) and the rocket has a velocity u to the right and so the tail of the rocket crosses A at a time (L0√ 1 − u2/c2) /u = L0/uγ(u) 6. E1 is the event of the origins coinciding at t = 0 = t′ and E2 is the event that R and R′ pass. In Σ′ this occurs at a time we call t′ RR′ at a place x′ = a. In Σ this occurs at a time we call tRR′ at a place x = a (i.e. the spatial coordinates happen to be the same in each frame). Thus E2 has coordinates (t′ RR′, x′ = a ) in Σ′ but (tRR′, x = a) in Σ. The Lorentz Transformations can be used in the form x′ = γ(u) (x − ut) . When x = a and t = tRR′ we are told that x′ = a and so x′ = a = γ(u) (a − utRr′) → a γ(u) = a − utRR′ tRR′ = a u ( 1 − 1 γ(u) ) = a u ( 1 − √ 1 − u2 c2 ) and this is the time of event E2 as judged in the frame Σ. However if we use the inverse Lorentz Transformation x = γ(u) (x′ + ut′ AA′) then in Σ′ we are told that event E2 has x′ = a but that x = a. Substituting gives x = a = γ(u) (x′ + ut ′ RR′) → a = γ(u) (a + ut′ RR′) γ(u)ut ′ Rr′ = a (1 − γ(u)) → t′ RR′′ = a u ( 1 γ(u) − 1) = a u (√ 1 − u2 c2 − 1 ) = − a u ( 1 − √ 1 − u2 c2 ) . Since the frames are in standard conﬁguration with t = t′ = 0 as the origins pass (event E1), tRR′ will be the time interval between E1 and E2 as measured in Σ and t′ RR′will be the time interval between E1 and E2 as measured in Σ′. Thus t ′ RR′ = −tRR′. Thus the two events occur in diﬀerent orders. Since u/c < 1, tRR′ > 0 and t′ RR′ < 0. In Σ, event E2 occurs later than event E1 (since tRR′ > 0) whereas in Σ′ event E2 occurs earlier than event E1 (since t′ RR′ < 0). 7. Use time dilation and the standard result τ = γ(u)τ0 = τ0√ 1 − u2/c2 . Take τ0 = 2.2×10−6 s to be the lifetime in the rest frame of the muon and τ = 1.9×10−5 s to be the lifetime in the frame of reference of the laboratory. Then √ 1 − u2/c2 = τ0 τ = 2.2 × 10−6 1.9 × 10−5 = 0.158 and 1 − u 2/c 2 = 0.01341 → u c ≃ 0.993. A laboratory dweller judges that the muon travels with a speed u = 0.993c for a time τ = 1.9 × 10−5 s and so the distance travelled by the muon in the laboratory frame is uτ = 0.993c × 1.9 × 10−5m ≃ 5.7 × 10 3 m. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Solutions to Example Sheet 1 8. γ(u1)γ(u2) = 1 √ 1 − u2 1/c2 × 1 √ 1 − u2 2/c2 = 1 √ 1 − u2 1/c2 − u2 2/c2 + u2 1u2 2/c4 But ( u1 c + u2 c ) 2 = u2 1 c2 + u2 2 c2 + 2u1u2 c2 and so 1 − u2 1 c2 − u2 2 c2 + u2 1u2 2 c4 = 1 − [( u1 c + u2 c )2 − 2u1u2 c2 ] + u2 1u2 2 c4 = 1 − ( u1 c + u2 c ) 2 + 2u1u2 c2 + u2 1u2 2 c4 . However (1 + u1u2 c2 )2 = 1 + 2u1u2 c2 + u2 1u2 2 c4 → 2u1u2 c2 + u2 1u2 2 c4 = (1 + u1u2 c2 )2 − 1 Substitute this into the previous expression and obtain 1 − ( u1 c + u2 c )2 + 2u1u2 c2 + u2 1u2 2 c4 = 1 − ( u1 c + u2 c ) 2 + (1 + u1u2 c2 )2 − 1 = (1 + u1u2 c2 )2 − ( u1 c + u2 c )2 = (1 + u1u2 c2 )2 [ 1 − 1 c2 ( u1 + u2 1 + u1u2 c2 )2] . Thus γ(u1)γ(u2) = 1 √ 1 − u2 1/c2 − u2 2/c2 + u2 1u2 2/c4 = 1 √(1 + u1u2/c2)2√[1 − 1 c2 ( u1+u2 1+u1u2/c2 )2] = 1 (1 + u1u2/c2) 1 √ 1 − 1 c2 ( u1+u2 1+u1u2/c2 )2 = 1 (1 + u1u2/c2) γ ( u1 + u2 1 + u1u2/c2 ) as required. 9. Σ′′ has a velocity u2 relative to Σ′ and Σ′ has a velocity u1 relative to Σ. Coordinates (x′′, t′′) of an event E in Σ′′ are related to the coordinates (x′, t′) of the same event in Σ′ by a standard Lorentz Transformation t ′′ = γ(u2) (t ′ − u2x′/c 2) and x ′′ = γ(u2) (x′ − u2t ′) . Likewise, coordinates (x′, t′) of an event E in Σ′ are related to the coordinates (x, t) of the same event in Σ by a standard Lorentz Transformation t′ = γ(u1) (t − u1x/c 2) and x′ = γ(u1) (x − u1t) . DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Solutions to Example Sheet 1 All we need do is substitute the second set of equations into the ﬁrst. Then t′′ = γ(u2) (t′ − u2x′/c 2) = γ(u2) (γ(u1) (t − u1x/c 2) − u2γ(u1) (x − u1t) /c 2) = γ(u2)γ(u1) (t − u1x/c 2 − u2x/c2 + u2u1t/c 2) = γ(u2)γ(u1) [ t (1 + u1u2/c 2) − (u1 + u2)x/c2] = γ(u2)γ(u1) (1 + u1u2/c 2) [t − (u1 + u2) (1 + u1u2/c2) x c2 ] . From the results of the previous question γ(u2)γ(u1) (1 + u1u2/c 2) = γ ( u1 + u2 1 + u1u2 c2 ) and hence t′′ = γ ( u1 + u2 1 + u1u2/c2 ) [ t − (u1 + u2) (1 + u1u2/c2) x c2 ] . Likewise x′′ = γ(u2) (x′ − u2t′) = γ(u2) (γ(u1) (x − u1t) − u2γ(u1) (t − u1x/c2)) = γ(u2)γ(u1) [ x − u1t − u2t + u1u2x/c 2] = γ(u2)γ(u1) [ x(1 + u1u2/c 2) − (u1 + u2)t ] = γ(u2)γ(u1)(1 + u1u2/c 2) [x − (u1 + u2) (1 + u1u2/c2) t ] = γ ( u1 + u2 1 + u1u2/c2 ) [ x − (u1 + u2) (1 + u1u2/c2) t ] If we write V = (u1 + u2)/(1 + u1u2/c2) then we see that we can write down these two results as t ′′ = γ(V ) (t − V x/c2) and x′′ = γ(V ) (x − V t) . This pair of equations is clearly a Lorentz Transformation with V = (u1 + u2) (1 + u1u2/c2) so that the eﬀect of performing two successive Lorentz Transformations, one with ve- locity u2 followed by a second Lorentz Transformation with velocity u1 is to produce another Lorentz Transformation with velocity V = (u1 + u2)/(1 + u1u2/c2). This result is the start of a proof that the set of Lorentz Transformation form a mathematical struc- ture called a group. This result also of course establishes the relativistic composition law for velocities. A more elegant (but equivalent) way of writing this out is to note that we can write the Lorentz Transformations out in the form ct ′′ = γ(u2) (ct ′ − (u2/c)x′) and x′′ = γ(u2) (x′ − (u2/c)ct ′) ct ′ = γ(u1) (ct − (u1/c)x) and x′ = γ(u1) (x − (u1/c)ct) . DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Solutions to Example Sheet 1 In this form they are symmetric in (ct) which has the dimensions of length and x which also of course has the dimensions of length. u2/c is then dimensionless. The ﬁrst pair can then be written in matrix form ( ct′′ x′′ ) = γ(u2) ( 1 −u2/c −u2/c 1 ) ( ct′ x′ ) and the second pair as ( ct′ x′ ) = γ(u1) ( 1 −u1/c −u1/c 1 ) ( ct x ) . Substituting the second in the ﬁrst then gives ( ct′′ x′′ ) = γ(u2)γ(u1) ( 1 −u2/c −u2/c 1 ) ( 1 −u1/c −u1/c 1 ) ( ct x ) . Performing the matrix multiplication and using the result of the previous question then gives ( ct′′ x′′ ) = γ(V ) ( 1 −V /c −V /c 1 ) ( ct x ) with V = (u1 + u2) (1 + u1u2/c2) . If you are familiar with matrix multiplication, try this for yourself. 10. For convenience, put the source of the light ﬂashes at rest at the origin of Σ′ which moves to the right along the common x − x′ axis with a velocity u as determined from Σ. The source is at rest in Σ′ and so Σ′ is a proper frame of reference. The source of the ﬂashes is at rest in Σ′ at the point x′ = 0. We will take Σ and Σ′ to be in standard conﬁguration and whose origins x = 0 = x′ cross at times t = 0 = t′.Consider the following two events E1 and E2. ‹ E1 is the emission of the ﬁrst ﬂash of light which occurs at some point (x1, t1) in Σ and at (x′ 1 = 0, t′ 1) in Σ′. This ﬁrst ﬂash which is emitted at a time t1 in Σ, travels back to the origin x = 0 of Σ and (since light travels at a speed c) reaches the origin of Σ after a time interval x1/c and so a clock at the origin of Σ will read a time T1 = t1 + x1/c when the ﬁrst ﬂash reaches the origin. ‹ E2 is the emission of a second ﬂash which occurs at some point (x2, t2) in Σ and at (x′ = 0, t′ 2) in Σ′. In the frame of reference Σ′, the source is at rest, and so the second ﬂash is emitted at a time τ0 after the ﬁrst as judged by an observer at rest in Σ′. This time interval τ0 is thus a proper time interval and t′ 2 = t′ 1 + τ0. The second ﬂash travels from the point x2 in Σ and so takes a time x2/c to reach the origin of Σ and does so when the clock at the origin of Σ reads T2 = t2 + x2/c. An observer at the origin of Σ thus received two ﬂashes of light separated by a time interval T2 − T1 = t2 − t1 + (x2 − x1)/c. But we can use the (inverse) Lorentz Transformations to relate(x, t) to (x′, t′). Thus t = γ(u)(t′ + ux ′/c 2) and x = γ(u)(x′ + ut ′) and t1 = γ(u)(t′ 1 + ux ′ 1/c 2) and x1 = γ(u)(x′ 1 + ut ′ 1) t2 = γ(u)(t′ 2 + ux ′ 2/c 2) and x2 = γ(u)(x′ 2 + ut ′ 2). DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Solutions to Example Sheet 1 Subtracting these gives T2 − T1 = t2 − t1 + (x2 − x1) c = γ(u) [t ′ 2 − t ′ 1 + u c2 (x′ 2 − x′ 1) + 1 c (x′ 2 − x′ 1 + u(t′ 2 − t′ 1) )] However, for convenience we placed the light source at th origin of Σ′ and so x′ 2 = 0 = x′ 1 and T2 − T1 = γ(u) [ t′ 2 − t′ 1 + + u c (t ′ 2 − t ′ 1)] = γ(u) (t ′ 2 − t ′ 1) (1 + u c ) . But t′ 2 − t′ 1 = τ0 and so the time interval which elapses between the observer at the origin of Σ receiving the two ﬂashes is T2 − T1 = τ and T2 − T1 = τ = τ0γ(u) (1 + u c ) = τ0 (1 + u/c) √ 1 − u2/c2 = τ0 (1 + u/c) √ (1 − u/c) (1 + u/c) = τ0 √ (1 + u/c) (1 − u/c) as required. We see that for two observers retreating with velocity u we have τ = τ0 k(u) where k(u) = √ (1 + u/c) (1 − u/c) as expected. The frequency ν with which an observer at the origin of Σ receives these ﬂashes is given by ν = 1 τ = 1 τ0 k(u) = ν0 k(u) = ν0 √ (1 − u/c) (1 + u/c) where ν0 = 1/τ0 is the frequency with which the source emits ﬂashes. If you think of these ﬂashes as corresponding to successive rests of a light wave then the result we have is the relativistic longitudinal Doppler Shift. In a Galilean /Newtonian world t′ = t and x′ = x − ut and t = t′ and x = x′ + ut = x′ + ut′ , but the light still travels with speed c and so (T2 − T1)Gal = [t2 − t1 + (x2 − x1) c ] Gal = t ′ 2 − t ′ 1 + 1 c (x′ 2 − x′ 1 + u (t ′ 2 − t ′ 1)) . We still have the source at the origin of Σ′ and so x′ 2 = 0 = x′ 1.Thus (T2 − T1)Gal = τGal = t′ 2 − t′ 1 + u c (t′ 2 − t′ 1) = (t ′ 2 − t ′ 1)(1 + u c ) and so since (t′ 2 − t′ 1) = τ0 we have τGal = τ0(1 + u c ). Notice that this is the result we would have obtained from relativity by writing γ(u) = 1. The frequencies νGal = 1/τGal and ν0 = 1/τ0 are thus related by νGal = ν0 (1 + u/c) . This is the classical non relativistic Doppler shift for the case where the source moves and retreats from a stationary observer. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Solutions to Example Sheet 1 11. (a) The light is emitted at (x1, t1) in Σ and absorbed at (x2, t2) in Σ and we are told that x2 = x1 + L . As judged from Σ′, the light is emitted at (x′ 1, t′ 1) and absorbed at (x′ 2, t′ 2). We use the Lorentz Transformations in the form x′ = γ(u) (x − ut) and t′ = γ(u)(t − ux/c 2) and so x′ 1 = γ(u) (x1 − ut1) and x′ 2 = γ(u) (x2 − ut2) t′ 1 = γ(u)(t1 − ux1/c 2) and t′ 2 = γ(u)(t2 − ux2/c 2). Thus x′ 2 − x′ 1 = γ(u) (x2 − x1 − u(t2 − t1)) = γ(u) (L − u(t2 − t1)) . But the light ﬂash has a speed c in both Σ and Σ′ and so the time taken for light to travel from x1 to x2 as judged by an observer in Σ is (t2 − t1) = L/c. Hence x′ 2 − x′ 1 = γ(u)L (1 − u/c) = Lγ(u) (1 − u/c) = L (1 − u/c) √ 1 − u2/c2 = L √ 1 − u/c 1 + u/c and this is the spatial separation of the points of emission and absorption as judged from Σ′. (b) An observer in Σ′ will judge there to be a time separation between emission and absorption which is t ′ 2 − t ′ 1 = γ(u) (t2 − t1 − u(x2 − x1)/c 2) and since once more (t2 − t1) = L/c we see that t ′ 2 − t ′ 1 = γ(u) (L/c − uL/c 2) = γ(u) L c (1 − u/c) = L c √ 1 − u/c 1 + u/c . as expected since the light must travel a distance x′ 2 − x′ 1 in Σ′ with speed c.
