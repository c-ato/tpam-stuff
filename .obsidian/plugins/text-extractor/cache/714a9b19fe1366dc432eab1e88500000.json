Standing wave frequencies on a string with both ends fixed:𝑓𝑛 = 𝑛𝑣 2𝐿, 𝑛 = 1,2,3, … 4. Standing wave frequencies on a string with only one end fixed (or pipes with one end open and one end stopped): 𝑓𝑛 = 𝑛𝑣 4𝐿, 𝑛 = 1,3,5, … 5. Lens-maker’s equation: 1 𝑓 = ( 𝑛𝑙 𝑛𝑚 − 1) ( 1 𝑟1 − 1 𝑟2). 6. Image magnification: 𝑚 = − 𝑠′ 𝑠 . 7. Speed of a wave on a string: 𝑣 = √𝑇 𝜇. 8. The Decibel scale for sound: 𝛽 = 10𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝐼 𝐼0). 9. Doppler shift due to moving source: 𝑓𝑟 = 𝑣 𝑣±𝑢𝑠. 10. Doppler shift due to moving receiver: 𝑓𝑟 = 𝑣±𝑢𝑟 𝑣 . 11. Beat: 𝑓𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑡 = 𝑓1 − 𝑓2. 12. Shock wave: sin 𝜃 = 𝑣 𝑢. 13. Double slit interference: 𝑦𝑚 = ± 𝑚𝜆𝐿 𝑑 . 14. Refraction at a spherical interface: 𝑛1 𝑠 + 𝑛2 𝑠′ = 𝑛2−𝑛1 𝑟 . 15. Sign rules for mirrors: s is +ve/-ve if object is in front/behind mirror. s’ is +ve/-ve if image is in front/behind mirror. f/r +ve/-ve if mirror is concave/convex. 16. Sign rules for refraction: Radius of curvature: Positive if centre of curvature on the same side of the outgoing ray. (convex towards object); otherwise, it is negative (concave towards object). s’: Positive if image is formed on the same side of the outgoing ray. (real image); otherwise, it is negative. s: Positive if object on the same side of the incoming light. Real images form on the side of a refracting surface that is opposite the object, and virtual images form on the same side of the object.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
