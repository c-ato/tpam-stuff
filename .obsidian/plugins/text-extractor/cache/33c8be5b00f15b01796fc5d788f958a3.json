The ﬁgure shows, in cross-section, portions of two inﬁnitely large, parallel, non-conducting sheets, each with a uniform charge distribution. The charge density for the sheet on the left is +3σ and that for the sheet on the right is −σ. Find the magnitude and direction of the total electric ﬁeld E in terms of σ: 1. To the left of both sheets; [2] 2. Between the sheets; [1] 3. To the right of both sheets. [2] Problem 2. A sphere S1 of radius R1 contains charge with a uniform density ρ. A spherical cavity S2 of radius R2 is cut out of the sphere. The centres of the spheres are separated by a vector distance a, with R2 + a < R1. Derive an expression for the electric ﬁeld E as a function of a and ρ in a generic location inside the spherical cavity. (Hint: Use the superposition principle to replace this sphere by two objects which are equavalent and keep everything in vector form.) [5] Classical Mechanics and Special Relativity 2 Assessed problem sheet 2 (1) Two alien spaceships approach The Earth from opposite directions, moving with equal and opposite velocities as measured by a stationary observer on The Earth. Their relative speed, as measured by the aliens, is 0.8c. Determine the speed of the spaceships as measured by the stationary observer on Earth. [3] (2) Three events, labelled A, B, and C, are observed in the same inertial frame. Their 2-D space-time (y=z=0) coordinates are: A(x=4m, t=10-8 s), B (x=1m, t=10-8 s), and C (x=6m, t=2x10-8 s). Determine which, in any, of these events could be caused by which others. [3] (3) Two events occur in the same place in the laboratory frame of reference and are separated by 3 seconds. (a) Calculate the space-time interval between these events [2] (b) What is the spatial distance between these events in a different frame of reference in which they are separated by 5s? [2] [You may take the speed of light, c to have the value 3x108 ms-1] Temperature and Matter 2024 Assessed problem 2 1. At room temperature, mercury (molar mass of 200.6 g mol−1) is in liquid form with a density of ρ = 13.35×103 kg m−3. Its surface tension is measured to be γ = 465×10−3 N m−1. (a) Estimate the number of atoms per m2 on the surface of liquid mercury. [7 marks] (b) Using a reasonable value for the co-ordination number, estimate the value of ϵ in the Lennard-Jones potential for mercury. [3 marks]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
