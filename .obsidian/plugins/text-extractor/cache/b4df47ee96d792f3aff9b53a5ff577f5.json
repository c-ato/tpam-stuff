Introduction to Probability We pick 4 balls out of 16: Ω = 16 4 There are 10 2 ways to get red There are 6 2 ways to get orange 𝑃 = 10 2 6 2 16 4 = 10 16 9 15 6 14 5 13 × 𝟒 𝟐 Set Theory Set Theory Previously we introduced sets. Elements in sets are unordered and unique. Now we introduce two operations on sets. First, we need Venn Diagrams. Introduction to Probability A set is a collection of things (elements) Venn Diagrams Introduction to Probability A Ω A C We have a space Ω. We then have a subset of Ω labelled A. We also have the part of Ω that is not A called the complement written as AC. Also can define A as: 𝐴 = {𝑥|𝑥 ∈ 𝐴} 𝐴 𝐶 = {𝑥|𝑥 ∉ 𝐴} Venn Diagrams (2) Introduction to Probability We have a space Ω. We have two subsets of Ω labelled A and B. The two sets overlap and the part in the middle is called the intersection written: A ∩ 𝐵 A Ω BA ∩ 𝐵 It is the elements in 𝐴 and 𝐵. 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = {𝑥|𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵} Venn Diagrams (3) Introduction to Probability We have a space Ω. We have two subsets of Ω labelled A and B. Everything that is in A or B is called the union written as 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 Ω A ∪ 𝐵 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = {𝑥|𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 𝐨𝐫 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵} Empty Set Introduction to Probability A special case is the empty set, written as ∅ If two sets have no common elements, then: The intersection is ∅ The sets are pairwise disjoint (mutually exclusive) The empty set is the complement of Ω Ω = ∅𝐶 A Ω B 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = ∅ Note 𝐴 ∩ 𝐴 𝐶 = ∅ 𝐴 ∪ 𝐴𝐶 = Ω De Morgan’s Laws Introduction to Probability 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 𝐶 𝐴 𝐶 ∩ 𝐵𝐶 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 𝐶 𝐴𝐶 ∪ 𝐵𝐶 Examples Example If: Ω = 1,2,3,4,5,6 A = 1,3,5 i.e. odd numbers B = 2,4,6 i.e. even numbers C = {1,2,3} i.e. numbers less than 4 Then what is: 1. 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 2. 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 3. Ω ∩ 𝐵 4. 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 Introduction to Probability 1. 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = 1,2,3,4,5,6 = Ω 2. 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 = 2 3. Ω ∩ 𝐵 = 2,4,6 = B 4. 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = ∅ Class Examples If Ω is a deck of cards, what is: 1. Red Cards ∪ Black Cards 2. Hearts ∪ Spades ∪ Diamonds ∪ Clubs 3. Cards with Numbers ∩ Diamonds 4. Spades ∩ Jacks Introduction to Probability 1. Every card is either black or red, so Red Cards ∪ Black Cards = Ω 2. Every card has a suite Hearts ∪ Spades ∪ Diamonds ∪ Clubs = Ω 3. Cards with Numbers ∩ Diamonds = {2 ⋄ ⋯ 9 ⋄, 10 ⋄} 4. Spades ∩ Jacks = Jack of Spades Inclusion-Exclusion Principle Probability and Sets The number of elements in the sets A and B satisfy 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = 𝐴 + 𝐵 − |𝐴 ∩ 𝐵| Introduction to Probability Ω 𝐀 ∪ 𝑩 A Ω B Ω = + − Ω𝐀 ∩ 𝑩 Probability Functions The same is true of probability functions 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 + 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) In words: Probability of A + Probability of B = Probability of A 𝐨𝐫 B + Probability of A 𝐚𝐧𝐝 B 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 and 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 are events just as much as 𝐴 or 𝐵 were. They are just sets. Introduction to Probability Consequences 𝑃 ∅ = 0 𝑃 𝐴 = 𝑝 → 𝑃 𝐴𝐶 = 1 − 𝑝 Introduction to Probability A Ω AC Ω 𝑃 𝐴 = 𝐴 |Ω| |∅| = 0 → 𝑃 ∅ = 0 Ω = 𝐴 ∪ 𝐴 𝐶 𝑃 Ω = 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 𝐴𝐶 − 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐴𝐶 𝐴 ∩ 𝐴𝐶 = ∅ so 1 = 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 𝐴 𝐶 Consequences (2) Introduction to Probability 𝑃 A ∩ 𝐵𝐶 = 𝑃 𝐴 − 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) Ω A B Ω B𝐴 𝑃 AC ∩ 𝐵𝐶 = 1 − 𝑃(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) Example 𝑃 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = 0.4, 𝑃 𝐴 = 0.1 and 𝑃 𝐵 = 0.3. What is 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ? Introduction to Probability Using the formula 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 𝐵 − 𝑃 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 So 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 0.1 + 0.3 − 0.4 = 0 This means the events 𝐴 and 𝐵 are pairwise disjoint. Multiple Events Multiple Events 𝑃 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 = 𝑃 𝑒1 + 𝑃 𝑒2 − 𝑃 𝑒1 ∩ 𝑒2 If 𝑒1 ∩ 𝑒2 = ∅ 𝑃 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 = 𝑃 𝑒1 + 𝑃 𝑒2 Introduction to Probability Ω 𝐀 ∪ 𝑩 A Ω B Ω = + − Ω𝐀 ∩ 𝑩 Multiple Events (2) Introduction to Probability 𝑃 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 ∪ 𝑒3 = 𝑃 𝑒1 + 𝑃 𝑒2 + 𝑃 𝑒3 − 𝑃 𝑒1 ∩ 𝑒2 − 𝑃 𝑒1 ∩ 𝑒3 − 𝑃 𝑒2 ∩ 𝑒3 + 𝑃 𝑒1 ∩ 𝑒2 ∩ 𝑒3 If 𝑒𝑖 ∩ 𝑒𝑗 = ∅ 𝑃 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 ∪ 𝑒3 = 𝑃 𝑒1 + 𝑃 𝑒2 + 𝑃 𝑒3 Multiple Events (3) If events 𝑒1, 𝑒2 … 𝑒𝑁 are all mutually exclusive then 𝑃 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 ∪ ⋯ ∪ 𝑒𝑁 = 𝑃 𝑒1 + 𝑃 𝑒2 + ⋯ 𝑃(𝑒𝑁) Or 𝑃 ራ 𝑛=1 𝑁 𝑒𝑛 = ෍ 𝑛=1 𝑁 𝑃(𝑒𝑛) Introduction to Probability Ω 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 𝑒4 Normalisation If 𝑒1, 𝑒2 … 𝑒𝑁 are mutually exclusive and Ω = 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 … 𝑒𝑁 Then P Ω = P e1 + P e2 + ⋯ 𝑃 𝑒𝑁 = 1 Example Ω = 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 ∪ 𝑒3 All disjoint and 𝑃 𝑒1 = 𝑃(𝑒2) = 𝑃(𝑒3). What is 𝑃 𝑒1 ? Introduction to Probability We have that 1 = 𝑃 𝑒1 + 𝑃 𝑒2 + 𝑃(𝑒3) 1 = 3𝑃 𝑒1 𝑃 𝑒1 = 1 3 Example If I toss a fair 6 sided die: 1. What is the probability that I see an even number? 2. What is the probability that I see an even number or 1,2 or 3? Introduction to Probability The even events are 2, 4 and 6 and these are mutually exclusive, so 𝑃 2 ∪ 4 ∪ 6 = 𝑃 2 + 𝑃 4 + 𝑃 6 = 3 6 = 1 2 Let 𝐴 = {2,4,6} and 𝐵 = {1,2,3} and these are not mutually exclusive, so 𝑃 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 𝐵 − 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 1 2 + 1 2 − 1 6 = 5 6 Summary 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 𝐵 − 𝑃(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) 𝑃 𝑒1 ∪ 𝑒2 ∪ ⋯ ∪ 𝑒𝑁 = 𝑃 𝑒1 + 𝑃 𝑒2 + ⋯ 𝑃(𝑒𝑁) Introduction to Probability Concept Formula Union 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 Intersection 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 Empty Set (disjoint) A ∩ 𝐵 = ∅ Sample Space A ∪ 𝐴 𝐶 = Ω Inclusion-Exclusion 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = 𝐴 + 𝐵 − 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵Examples Example Someone is interested in how often they eat ice cream, but unfortunately they only have data relating to the weather as well. Historically, the following facts are true: 1. The probability of rain on any day is 1/4 2. It rains and the person eats ice with probability 1/10 3. The probability that it rains or the person eats ice cream is 1/3 What is the probability the person eats ice cream? Introduction to Probability r: rain i: ice cream 𝑃 r = 1 4 ; 𝑃 r ∩ i = 1 10 ; 𝑃 r ∪ i = 1 3 𝑃 r ∪ i = 𝑃 𝑟 + 𝑃 𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑟 ∩ 𝑖 → 𝑃 i = 𝑃 𝑟 ∪ 𝑖 + 𝑃(𝑟 ∩ 𝑖) − 𝑃 𝑟 𝑃 i = 1 3 + 1 10 − 1 4 = 11 60 Class Examples 1. If 𝐴 = {1,2,3, … 16} and 𝐵 are all the positive numbers that perfectly divide by 3, what is |𝐴 ∩ 𝐵|? 2. If 𝐴 = {1,2,3, … 16}, 𝐵 are all the numbers that divide by 3, and 𝐶 are the numbers that divide 5 what is |𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶|? 3. If I pick two numbers from 𝐴 = {1,2,3, … 16}, what is the probability that at least one divides 3? Introduction to Probability Solutions 1. We need the set 𝐵 = {3,6,9, … }. Then 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = {3,6,9,12,15} 2. We also need the set 𝐶 = {5,10,15 … }. Then 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 = {15}. 3. Number of pairs in {1,2,3, … 16} is 16 2 . The number of pairs with no divisors of three is 11 2 so 𝑃 at least 1 divisor of three = 1 − 11 2 16 2 = 13 24 Introduction to Probability","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
