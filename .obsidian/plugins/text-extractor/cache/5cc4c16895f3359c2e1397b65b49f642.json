The bodies and the Earth acquire a common potential - called zero of potential 7 Earth • The potential of the Earth does not change 𝑉𝑎 = 1 4𝜋𝘀0 𝑄𝑎 𝑎 • because a is very large • Similar to the use of sea level as a reference for altitude 8 Earthing • Earthing or grounding 9 Capacitance for Charge • Q placed on a conductor changes the conductor’s potential by 𝑉 ∝ 𝑄 • We define the capacitance C of the conductor by the equation: 𝐶 = 𝑄 𝑉 • Unit of C - Coulomb Volt-1 - Farad (F) • Named after Faraday 10 Capacitance • So anything that can hold a charge has a capacitance (not just parallel plates). • Example: an isolated conducting sphere of radius R and carrying a charge Q: • 𝑉 = 𝑄 4𝜋𝜀0𝑅 → 𝐶 = 𝑄 𝑉 = 4𝜋𝘀0𝑅 • A sphere of radius 9  109 m (more than 103  that of the Earth) would have a capacitance of about 1 farad. • Common capacitors in use: pF-mF 11 Capacitors • It is a system designed for the storage of separated positive and negative charges • Capacitors store charge and hence energy. 12 Energy Stored in Capacitor • Transfer q between the two conductors whilst at a potential difference of Vq • 𝑞 = 𝐶𝑉𝑑 → 𝑑𝑞 = 𝐶 𝑑𝑉𝑞 • Work done = 𝑊 = 𝐶 ׬0 𝑉 𝑉𝑞 𝑑𝑉𝑞 = 1 2 𝐶𝑉2 = 𝑈 13 Work done 𝛿𝑊 = 𝛿𝑞 𝑉𝑞 Total work = ׬0 𝑄 𝑉𝑞𝑑𝑞 Energy Stored in Capacitor • Capacitance defined as: 𝐶 = 𝑄 𝑉 • Energy stored in the electric field between the “plates” of a capacitor 14 𝑈 = 1 2 𝐶𝑉2 = 1 2 𝑄𝑉 = 1 2 𝑄2 𝐶 Calculation of Capacitance • Procedure: 1.
