The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Problem 2.1 Stretching The stress on the wire is the force, M g, with M = 600 kg, divided by the area, A = 2 × 10 −5 m2, of the cable. Thus we have F A = Y δℓ ℓ ⇒ F A ℓ δℓ = Y Now the strain, δℓ/ℓ = 5 × 10 −4/5 = 10−4. The stress is F A = M g A = 600 × 10 2 × 10−5 Pa = 3 × 10 8 Pa . Substituting these into the expression for Y yields: Y = F A ℓ δℓ = 3 × 10 8 × 10 4 Pa = 3 × 10 12 Pa , which is a bit high. Finally we should check whether we needed to include the mass of the wire when working out the tension and hence the extension (it is intuitively small, but good to check). We are given the density of steel (ρsteel = 8 × 10 3kgm −3) for that purpose. The unstretched volume of the wire is 5 × 2 × 10 −5 m3, so the mass of the cable, mcable = ρsteel 10 −4 kg = 0.8 kg ≪ 600 kg . Thus the mass of the cable is negligible. Problem 2.2 Lateral contraction Poisson’s ratio for steel is νsteel = 0.3. So δw/δℓ = 0.3, where δw is the change in the width of the object. Since δℓ = 5 × 10 −4 m, we see that δw = 0.3δℓ = 1.5 × 10 −4 m. Problem 2.3 Stretching and cooling For a change in temperature ∆T , the fractional change in length is δℓ ℓ = α∆T . This thermal strain must be of the opposite sign to the strain from the weight – so the temperature must be decreased. The strain, ϵ, due to the weight is ϵ = 10 −4, so α∆T = −10 −4 ⇒ ∆T = −10 −4 α = − 10 −4 1.3 × 10−5 K = −7.7 K . 2 ELASTICITY – SOLUTIONS 2 Problem 2.4 Auxetic materials Consider the two-dimensional auxetic material with geometry deﬁned in Fig. (2.1). All joints are freely hinged. Firstly note that for θ → π/2, to avoid the constituents overlapping we Figure 2.1: The notation for auxetic materials. need 2ℓ2 ≤ ℓ1. In that limit the ﬁgure collapses to zero length in the lateral direction and a \"height\" of (N ℓ1)/2, where N is the number of layer of the bow-ties one has. For ﬁxed θ, the expression for w is w = ℓ1 − 2ℓ2 sin θ . and for ℓ3 is: ℓ3 = 2ℓ2 cos θ . Let us now consider small variations around a particular value of θ, i.e. θ → θ + δθ. Now we determine the eﬀect on w and ℓ3. w = ℓ1 − 2ℓ2 sin θ ⇒ w + δw = ℓ1 − 2ℓ2 sin(θ + δθ) ≃ ℓ1 − 2ℓ2 [sin(θ) + δθ cos(θ)] ⇒ δw = −2ℓ2δθ cos θ (2.1) and ℓ3 = 2ℓ2 cos θ ⇒ ℓ3 + δℓ3 = 2ℓ2 [cos(θ + δθ)] = 2ℓ2 [cos θ − δθ sin θ] ⇒ δℓ3 = −2ℓ2δθ sin θ . (2.2) Now let us eliminate δθ from Eq. (2.1) and Eq. (2.2) to obtain a relation between δw and δℓ3: δw 2ℓ2 cos θ = δℓ3 2ℓ2 sin θ ⇒ δw δℓ3 = cot θ 2 ELASTICITY – SOLUTIONS 3 Remembering that the δw has a minus sign in the deﬁnition of Poisson’s ratio – ie contrac- tion is regarded as positive, we see: ν = − cot θ . Problem 2.5 Elastic energy of a compressed rod The rod has cross sectional area t 2, so the relation between the strain and the stress is F (x) A = F (x) 4t2 = Y x L0 , where F (x) is the force at a compression of x and Y is the Young’s modulus for the material of the rod. Thus the work, W comp, performed by the force in compressing the rod by an amount d is: W comp = ∫ d 0 dx F (x) = 4t 2Y L0 ∫ d 0 dx x = 2t 2Y d 2 L0 . ♣Problem 2.6 Elastic energy of a bent rod and the Euler instability Consider the same uncompressed rod as in the last problem, but now bend the centre of the rod into an arc of a circle with radius a with angle θ. See Fig. (2.2) Figure 2.2: The rod of thickness 2t, bent through an angle θ. The arc-length of the middle of the rod is L0, so L0 = 2aθ. The arc-length of the outer/inner side of the rod is L(r = a ± t) = 2(a ± t)θ. Consider the rod as a set of thin rectangular plates, of thickness dr. The the stress-strain relation of the plate at radius r is F (r, x) tdr = Y x(r) L0 . 2 ELASTICITY – SOLUTIONS 4 The total extension or compression of the sheet depends on its radius: X(r) = L(r) − L0 = 2rθ − 2aθ , where a − t ≤ r ≤ a + t. Then we may deduce the elastic energy in the plate at radius r as being: W (r) = ∫ X(r) 0 dx F (r, x) = tY dr L0 ∫ X(r) 0 dx x = tY dr 2L0 X(r) 2 . We now must add up the contributions from the plates at diﬀerent r: W tot = ∫ a+t a−t dr W (r) = tY 2L0 ∫ a+t a−t dr X(r) 2 = tY 2L0 ∫ a+t a−t dr 4θ2(r − a) 2 letting u = r − a, = tY 2L0 ∫ t −t du 4θ2u 2 = 4θ2tY 2L0 [ u 3 3 ]t −t = 4θ2tY 2L0 2 3 t 3 using 2θa = L0, = L0t 2Y 3 ( t a )2 . (2.3) Let us now eliminate a in preference for the change in separation of the end points of the bar, d. See Fig. (2.3) d = L0 − 2a sin θ (use L0/(2a) = θ) = L0 − 2a sin ( L0 2a ) = L0 − 2a (L0 2a − 1 3! [L0 2a ]3 + · · · ) ≃ 2a 3! [L0 2a ]3 ⇒ 3! d L 3 0 = 1 (2a)2 2 ELASTICITY – SOLUTIONS 5 Figure 2.3: The displacement of the end of the rod, d, after bending through an angle θ. We may now eliminate the factor of 1/a 2 in Eq. (2.3): W tot = L0t 2Y 3 ( t a )2 = L0t 2Y 3 ( 3! × 4dt 2 L3 0 ) = 8t4Y d L2 0 = W bend (2.4) If we now equate the two energies for ﬁxed d, we may ask which deformation – compression or bending – is preferable. Note the energy of the compression grows like d2 where as the bending energy is linear in d. So for small d, compression is preferable. Let us calculate the Critical force to be applied in compression when the rod will bend. We do this be equating the energies to determine the value of dcrit and from that determine the force F crit: W comp(dcrit) = W bend(d crit) ⇒ 2t 2Y [ dcrit]2 L0 = 8t 4Y d crit L2 0 ⇒ d crit = 4t 2 L0 ⇒ F (d crit) = F crit = 4t 2Y dcrit L0 = 16t 4Y L2 0 So the critical force rises steeply with the cross sectional area (A2) and decreases rapidly with length. Our assumption about the circular arc is not quite right – which alters the numerical prefactor (i.e. 16) – but the dependence on the physical variables is correct. The original application of this by Euler (the Euler strut) had slightly diﬀerent boundary conditions, and represented a vertical column being loaded from the top (under the inﬂuence of gravity), with the question being when it buckled. Again the dependence on the physical variables is the same as our solution 2 ELASTICITY – SOLUTIONS 6 Notice unthinking dimensional analysis would not work as we have two lengths in the solution: t and L0.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
