In an inertial frame Σ two events occur at distance 10 × 108 m away from each other and are separated by a time interval of 3 s. (a) Calculate the space-time interval ∆s2 between the events. Is there an inertial frame in which these events happen at the same space point? Justify your answer by using the value of the space-time interval you found. [5] (b) In some inertial frame Σ′ the events happen simultaneously. Find the velocity of the frame Σ′ relative to Σ [5] 2. Spaceship B appears to have velocity u in the positive x direction as observed from the spaceship A. Find the velocity V of the spaceship C relative to the spaceship A so that the spaceships A and B have opposite velocities of equal magnitude. [10] 3. Two particles each having rest mass m are approaching each other with velocity v (in some inertial frame). (a) Write down the total energy E of the particles and their total momentum p [1] (b) In the reference frame Σ′ the rightmost particle is at rest. Assuming that the leftmost particle has velocity v′ write down the total energy E′ of the particles and their total momentum p′ in the new frame of reference. [2] (c) Using invariance of the combination E2/c2 − p2 ﬁnd the velocity v′ and show that it obeys the relativistic law of velocity composition. [7] 4. Obtaining a university degree doubles the chances of a successful career. Only one quarter of young people go to university. What is the probability that a person with a successful career does not have a university degree? [10] A22622 Page 2 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 5. Consider the generating function g(z) = A sinh z = ∞∑ n=0 pnzn of a discrete probability distribution pn. (a) Find the value of the constant A and calculate the probabilities for n = 0 and for n = 1. [5] (b) Write down the deﬁnitions for the mean µ and the variance σ2 of the distribution pn and calculate them using the generating function above. [5] 6. A one-dimensional quantum mechanical wavefunction is ψ(x) = Cxe−x , where the particle is restricted to the region x ∈ [0, ∞] and C is the (real) normalisation constant. Find the normalisation constant C and calculate the uncertainty in position ∆x = √⟨x2⟩ − ⟨x⟩2 of the particle.

The space ship crew plans to enter inside the gate of length L using the shown trajectory keeping the space ship parallel to the gate. The velocity v (in the station’s reference frame) makes the angle θ with the gate’s plane. Choose a coordinate system with ˆx axis parallel to the space ship velocity, v = vˆx, the ˆy axis as shown and the origin coinciding with the left end of the opening. (a) Give a deﬁnition of proper length. [2] (b) Using the time measured by the space station’s clocks, the event of the rear of the space ship entering the station is Er = (tr, xr, yr, zr) = (0, 0, 0, 0) and the event of the front of the space ship entering the station is Ef = (tf , xf , yf , zf ) = (0, X, Y, 0). Express X and Y in terms of the space ship length l measured in the station’s reference frame and state the condition on the length l for the space ship to be able to enter the station gate. Neglect the width of the space ship. [8] (c) The condition on the maximal length of the spaceship is communicated to the space ship crew and captain. The crew measures the length of their ship and ﬁnd that it is actually twice longer than the communicated length limit. Nevertheless the captain decides the passage is still possible. Upon which relativistic phenomenon does he base his decision? [5] (d) The angle θ = 30◦ is communicated to the space ship crew from the station. Perform a Lorentz transformation to the reference frame moving with the space ship, and ﬁnd the corresponding coordinates of the events Er and Ef . By using these results or otherwise ﬁnd the minimum velocity v which will allow it to enter the space station gate. [15] A22622 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 8. (a) Deﬁne the probability density p(x) of a random variable a < x < b and explain how to normalise it. [3] (b) If the random variable x is mapped onto y using the monotonically increasing function y(x) show the following relation between their probability densities, P (y) = p(x)dx dy , for y(a) < y < y(b) . [5] A thermal source with temperature T produces relativistic particles of (rest) mass m. The particles move in the xy plane, so that the the momentum magnitude p = √p2 + p2 is distributed according to probability density f (p) = A p e−E(p)/kBT , where A is a normalisation constant. (c) State the relativistic relation E(p) between the energy and momentum. [3] (d) Show that the probability density p(E) of the energy of the emitted particles is p(E) = AE c2 e−E/kBT . State the interval of energy E for which p(E) is deﬁned. [4] (e) Find the constant A. [5] (f) Calculate the mean energy ¯E of the emitted particles. Write down the result in the limit kBT ≪ mc2 and explain the physical meaning of the expression. [10] A22622 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 9. An atom is found in a cubic container with size length L at random position with coordinates (x, y, z). (a) Find the probability p(x)dx for the coordinate x of the atom to be found in the interval [x, x + dx]. By considering similar intervals for coordinates y and z show that the joint probability density p(x, y, z) which allows to ﬁnd probability to ﬁnd the atom in a inﬁnitesimal volume dxdydz situated at (x, y, z) is p(x, y, z) = 1/L3 [5] (b) Using the probability density from the previous part, ﬁnd the probability for an atom inside the cube to be outside the volume v. [3] (c) Suppose now that the cube contains N atoms with positions distributed randomly according to the probability distribution p(x, y, z). Find the probability p0 that the volume v is empty. Assume that atoms are independent and do not inﬂuence each other. [5] (d) Using the mean density n = N/L 3 of the atom show that in the limit v/L3 → 0 and for ﬁxed n the probability p0 becomes p0 = e−nv . . [7] (e) Find the probability distribution f (v) of the size v of an empty region. [Hint: Use the probabilistic deﬁnition of its cumulative distribution function F (S) = ∫ S 0 f (s)ds .] Calculate the mean distance between the points in the cube using this distribution.
