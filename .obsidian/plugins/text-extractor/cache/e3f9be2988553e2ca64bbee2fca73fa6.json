Evans d.evans@bham.ac.uk Last Lecture • Some more examples of continuous charge distributions – Infinite plane – Inside charged hollow sphere • Electric flux • Gauss’s Law – Examples using Gauss’s Law 2 Gauss’s Law • This is Gauss’s Law – You need to know this and know how to use it න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 𝜀0 • Very useful for solving problems where there’s symmetry (see examples). 3 Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss number theory, statistics, analysis, differential geometry, electrostatics, astronomy, and optics Born: 30 April 1777 in Brunswick, Duchy of Brunswick Died: 23 Feb 1855 in Göttingen, Hanover Lecture 3 Content • More examples using Gauss’s Law 5 Solid Sphere with Uniform Charge 6 Q r Example: Sphere of radius R uniformly charged throughout its volume. Total charge Q (a) E-field for r > R Method: set up an (imaginary) Gaussian Surface and use symmetry (b) E-field for r < R E-field outside & inside uniform charged sphere 7 ~1/r2 ~r 𝐸 = 𝑄 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟2 𝐸 = 𝑄 𝑟 4𝜋𝜀0𝑅3 (a) Outside r > R (b) Inside r < R What about Solid Sphere with Non-Uniform Charge 8 (r) r Example: Sphere of radius R with charge density 𝜌 𝑟 = 𝜌0𝑟 E-field for r < R Let’s solve this using the visualizer Now 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 = ׬0 𝑟 𝜌 𝑟 𝑑𝑉 න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 1 𝜀0 න 0 𝑟𝜌 𝑟 𝑑𝑉 Use Gauss’s Law and symmetry E-fields in Conductors • EXTERNAL E-FIELD. Electrons are free to move, and exist in vast quantities. • Free electrons drift to the surface until they create 9 E = 0 an equal but opposite E-field that cancels external E-field. 𝑬 = 0 in a conductor න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 0 Thus Q=0, free charge found on surface only Application: shielding sensitive electronics from E-fields Gauss’s Law: More Examples • Spherical Shell • Infinite sheet of charge – Non-conducting – Conducting • Infinite charged thin wire 10 E-field Inside Uniform Charged Shell • We already know it’s zero from before but now use Gauss’s Law. 11 Q Inside shell (using Gauss’s Law) න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 𝜀0 = 0 → 𝐸 = 0 E-field Inside Uniform Charged Shell 12 Q Inside shell (using Gauss’s Law) න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 𝜀0 = 0 → 𝐸 = 0 Outside shell (using Gauss’s Law) න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄 𝜀0 → 4𝜋𝑟2𝐸 = 𝑄 𝜀0 𝐸 = 𝑄 4𝜋𝜀0𝑟2 r E-field Inside Uniform Charged Shell 13 For ‘thin’ shell Note: Same as for conducting material Infinite Charged Sheet • Non-Conducting (charge uniform throughout sheet) – surface charge density =  14 As sheet is infinite (i.e. no edge effects) E is ⊥ to the sheet. Use a cylindrical Gaussian surface - axis ⊥ to the sheet (as shown).  Infinite Charged Sheet 15 Make area of end of cylindrical Gaussian surface = A No E-field coming out of side walls, only ends න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 𝜀0  LHS: total flux,  = AE + AE = 2AE RHS: total charge on surface = A So RHS = A / 0 𝐸 = 𝜎 2𝜀0 Infinite Charged Sheet 16 02e s =E The result agrees with the one we found by taking the infinite radius limit of a disk. But much easier method (only works for infinite sheet, otherwise have to use integration as before). Infinite Charged Sheet • Conducting (charge only on surface, not inside conductor) – surface charge density =  • Charges move until E = 0 inside a conductor • No net charges exist inside a conductor • Free (extra) charges reside on surface 17 E-field due to an infinite conducting sheet • Q distributes until there is a charge density on both surfaces 18   E E We now repeat the “pill box” construction. No E-field inside E-field due to an infinite conducting sheet • Apply Gauss’s Law 19   A E 𝐸 = 𝐸𝐴 = 𝜎𝐴 𝜀0 ∴ 𝐄 = 𝝈 𝜺𝟎 Factor of 2 difference between the fields of insulator and conducting infinite planes.

E · d A ò = 0 E = 0 ?? If the charge falls outside the Gaussian Surface, the net flux through the surface is zero. No. In this case E is not parallel to dA and not constant around surface Summary on Gauss’s Law • In situations of high symmetry (planar, spherical, cylindrical), Gauss’s law allows us to compute quantitatively the E-field in a straightforward manner. • Very useful. 27 න 𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑙 𝜀0","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
