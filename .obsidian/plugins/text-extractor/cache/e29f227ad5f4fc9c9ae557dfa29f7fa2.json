The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Problem 3.1 Mixing water 100g of water and 100◦C is mixed with 400g of water at 20◦C. What is the ﬁnal temperature of the mixture? Problem 3.2 Hot electronics Some electronic circuitry on a piece of silicon of mass 20 mg produces heat at a rate of 5mW. If there is no means of transporting heat out of the device, at what rate does the temperature of the silicon increase? [The speciﬁc heat capacity of silicon is 705 Jkg −1K−1.] Problem 3.3 Expansion A gas is kept at constant pressure. If its temperature is changed from 50 ◦C to 100 ◦C, by what factor does its volume change? Problem 3.4 Isothermal expansion An ideal gas is initially at temperature 20 ◦C, pressure 200 kPa and has a volume of 4 litres. It undergoes an isothermal expansion until its pressure is reduced to 100 kPa. Find the work done by the gas and the heat added to the gas during expansion. Problem 3.5 Adiabatic expansion One mole of an ideal monatomic gas expands adiabatically from a pressure of pi = 10 atmospheres and a temperature of Ti = 0 ◦C to a pressure of pf = 2 atmospheres. Find the initial, Vi, and ﬁnal, Vf, volumes, the ﬁnal temperature, Tf, and the work done by the gas, Wby. Problem 3.6 A simple thermodynamic cycle Consider an ideal gas undergoing the following cycle. An isothermal compression, at tem- perature T0, is made from (pi, Vi) to Vf. Calculate pf. At constant volume, Vf, the gas cools with the pressure dropping from pf to pi. Finally the gas expands at constant pressure to Vi. Calculate the work performed on the gas, Won, and the heat input into the gas, Qin. Problem 3.7 Bow tie cycle Consider the bow tie contour in Fig. (3.1). We work with an ideal gas. The section (p1, V1) → (p2, V2) is adiabatic and (p3, V2) → (p4, V1) is isothermal, at temperature T0 and V2 = V1/2. Note that γ > 1. 3 THERMODYNAMICS AND IDEAL GASES 2 Figure 3.1: The bowtie cycle. 1. Derive p2 in terms of p1, n, the number of moles and V1. 2. Derive p4 and p3 In terms of T0 and V1. 3. Determine the work done on the adiabatic and isothermal paths. 4. What is the work done on the other two sections? 5. If the whole cycle is to have zero net work, what value must T0 have? Problem 3.8 The atmospheric lapse rate The atmosphere does not conduct heat very well – which is why convection often occurs. Can we use this observation to deduce how the temperature drops in the troposphere with altitude, or at least its stability? If the atmosphere does not conduct well, any process where one displaces some air should be adiabatic. Start from the First Law in the form: mcv dT + p dV = 0 where m is the mass of the air being displaced, and cv is the speciﬁc heat per unit mass. Assume the change is adiabatic and show that cp dT − 1 ρ dp = 0 , where ρ is the density. Write down the expression for the hydrostatic equilibrium we considered when discussing the isothermal atmosphere in diﬀerential form. involving p and the height h. Hence show that the dry adiabatic lapse rate, Γd, is Γd = dT dh = − g cp . 3 THERMODYNAMICS AND IDEAL GASES 3 Given, for air, cp ≃ 1kJ kg−1K−1, derive the numerical value of Γd. The decrease in tem- perature is actually 6.5 K km−1. What can you say about stability of such an atmosphere? Provide a physical argument. [Actually the answers are closer if one takes into account moisture in the air.]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
