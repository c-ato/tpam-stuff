Fiz. 89,380-399 (August 1985) A two-dimensional exactly solvable model of a conformal quantum field theory is developed which is self-dual and has ZN symmetry. The operator algebra, the correlation functions, and the anomalous dimensions of all fields are calculated for this model, which describes self-dual critical points in 2,-symmetric statistical systems. INTRODUCTION There are good grounds for believing that fluctuations of the macroscopic fields (\"of the order parameter\") at a second-order phase-transition point possess conformal as well as scale invariance. ' From this viewpoint, the principal task in the theory of second-order phase transitions-the classification of all types of universal critical behavior--can be formulated as the problem of finding the conformally in- variant solutions of quantum field theory. Polyakov2 sug- gested constructing these solutions by combining the re- quirement of conformal invariance with the Ansatz that the field operators form an algebra. This problem has recently been found3 to admit at d = 2 an exact solution in many cases; this comes about because the conformal group of two- dimensional space is infinite-dimensional, and the fields that form an operator algebra can be classified in terms of the representations of the Virasoro algebra, for which a well- developed theory An infinite set of exactly solvable \"minimal\"conforma1 field theory models (related to the strongly degenerate representations of the Virasoro algebra) was found in Ref. 3; in these models, the space of fields form- ing the operator algebra contains a finite number of irreduci- ble representations. Each of these models is described by two relatively prime numbers p, q and corresponds to a central charge. in the Virasoro algebra. It was shown in Ref. 6 that only the \"principal series\" (q = p + 1, p) 3) of minimal models sat- isfies the positivity condition.\" The mathematical structure of the minimal models in the principal series is by now fairly well understood; in particular the correlation function and structure constants of the operator algebra have been calcu- lated.' The four simplest models in the principal series (p = 3, 4, 5, 6) turn out to describe the critical points of the Ising (p = 3) (Ref. 3) and Z3 Potts (p = 5) (Ref. 8) models, in addition to the corresponding tricritical models (p = 4, 6) (Refs. 6, 9). In Ref. 10, the anomalous dimensions corre- sponding to all the principal-series minimal models were found to coincide with the exponents at the \"ferromagnetic\" critical points of the exactly solvable RSOS model recently discovered in Ref. 1 1. The minimal models certainly do not exhaust the class of all solutions of conformal field theory for d = 2. For in- stance, a series of exactly solvable models with superconfor- ma1 ~~mmetry~.'~ and conformally invariant solutions of the Wess-Zumino models13 are known to exist. In these cases the conformally invariant field theory also possesses a more gen- eral type of infinite symmetry which is generated by local currents and is described by the Neveu-Schwarz and Kac- Moody algebras in the first and second cases, respectively. Reference 14 examines some other types of infinite symme- tries generated by local currents. In this paper we consider a conformal field theory with an infinite symmetry generated by nonlocal currents with fractional spins (\"parafermions\" ) . Conserved parafermion currents were discovered by one of us (V. F.) in the minimal models with p = 5, 6. In general, the parafermion currents form closed operator algebras which are associated in a natu- ral way with commutative groups. We will investigate a se- ries of very simple exactly solvable models corresponding to the cyclic groups Z, with N> 2. These models are confor- mally invariant and have central charge in the Virasoro algebra. In addition to their explicit ZN sym- metry, the operator algebras for these models are also self- dual (they possess \"order-disorder\" symmetry). Thus, for a given N there exist N - 1 fields a,, k = 1, 2, . . . ., N - 1 (order parameters) with anomalous dimension and N - 1 \"dual\" fields p, (\"disorder parameters\") with the same dimensions as in ( 1.3), and all the correlation func- tions are invariant under the interchange a~p. The opera- tor algebra also contains ZN-neutral fields &'\", j = 1, 2, . . . . , <N/2 of dimension 2Dj=2j (j+l) l (Nf 2). (1.4) We note here that the dimensions given by ( 1.3 1, ( 1.4) coin- cide exactly with the exponents characterizing the \"antifer- romagnetic\" critical points of the RSOS model.\"*'0 More- over, the solutions that we construct for N= 2, 3 also coincide2' with the minimal theories p = 3, 5 and describe critical points of the Z, Ising and Z3 Potts models, respec- 215 Sov.

We propose that our solutions for N> 3 describe the self-dual critical points of the ZN Ising models; we will dis- cuss this hypothesis more fully in Sec. 6. 2. SELF-DUAL SYSTEMS WITH IN SYMMETRY AND PARAFERMION CURRENTS We consider a two-dimensional lattice statistical sys- tem with cyclicZ, symmetry (theZN Ising model, the sim- plest example of such a system, is discussed in Sec. 6). We can describe the ZN degrees of freedom by associating \"spin\" variables a, to each node rd in a (square) lattice L; thea, taketheNvaluesmq (q=O, 1,2,. . .,N- l),where It is helpful to immediately define the N - 1 (dependent) variablesa,,, = (ar ),, k = 1, 2, . . . , N - 1, which take the value mkq ; we will write a,- ,,, = UL. Assume that the sys- tem has a critical point at which the correlation radius of the '6 spins\" a,,, becomes infinite. In such a theory the long- range correlations of the spins ak can be described by contin- uous conformal fields a, (x), x€R2 (uN- , = ak+ ) with anomalous dimensions 2dk, where d, = dN - , . The critical theory will then be ZN-symmetric if and only if the correla- tions are invariant under the transformation for arbitrary integral m. We will say that the field a, (x) has ZN-charge equal to k; of course, the ZN-charge is only de- fined modulo N. Z,-symmetric systems possess order-disorder duality (Kramers-Wannier symmetry).1s-18 We will assume that the ZN-system is self-dual (i.e., invariant under the Kramers-Wannier transformation) at the critical point in question. This means that in addition to the conformal fields a, (x) (order parameters), the theory also contains dual conformal fields p, (x), k = 1, 2, . . . , N - 1 (disorder pa- rameters) with the same anomalous dimensions 2dk. The main properties of the dual fieldsp, (x) are'as follows (see, e.g., Refs. 19 and 20 for the details of the definition). The correlation functions (CF) are in general N-valued functions of the coordinates xi, yi eR2; if we analytically continue the CF (2.3) with respect to xi, say, along a path enclosing the point yi counterclock- wise as shown in Fig. 1, the CF acquires a phase factor m - Fields a, (x) and p, (x) with this property will be called mutually semiloca13' with exponent ykl = - ~I/N. TWO fields A (x) and B (x) are said to be mutually local if y,, is an integer. The field A (x) is semilocal (local) if it is semilocal (local) with respect to itself. For example, the fields a, (x) and a,. (x ) [as well asp, (x) and p, . (x ) ] are mutually lo- cal. In self-dual systems all correlations are invariant under the interchange a, ep,. In addition toZN-symmetry (2.2), the theory possesses the dual zN-invariance FIG. 1. Path along which the correlation function is continued with re- spect to the variable xi. The fields p, (x ) thus have 2, -charge equal to I. In general, we will say that the field (x) has ZN ~2~-char~e {k, I) if it transforms as under (2.2) and (2.4). Thus, the fields ak (x) and p, (x) have charge {k, 0) and {0, k). We observe that the ZN- theories #(,,[) (x) and #(,.,,., (x) are mutually semilocal with exponent We will assume that our ZN xZN theory is C- and P-invar- iant, and that these inversions transform the fields as For the case of Z2-symmetry (Ising model), the most singular terms in the operator expansion of the product cr(x)p(O) (where a = a,, p = p,) are given by (see, e.g., Ref. 3) where we have introduced the complex coordinates of RZ: and $(z) and $(TI are the \"right- and left-hand\" compo- nents of the free Fermi fieldz2 satisfying the massless Dirac equation a2 $ = = 0. For N> 2 the most singular terms in the operator expansions of a, (x)pk (0) and a, (x)pk+ (0) can be written in the form where we have used the symmetries (2.7). Here $, and qk are certain conformal fields, and the parameters A, and x, are the nonnegative \"dimensions\" of these fields. Since the mutual-locality exponent of the fields a, and p, is equal to - k '/N, we have k2 Ah-&=- - ( N mod Z) . We assume that there exist self-dual critical points of the ZN-models with N> 2 for which xk = 0 as in (2.8), and that the fields $, and qk satisfy the equations 21 6 Sov. Phys. JETP 62 (2), August 1985 A. B. Zamolodchikov and V. A. Fateev 216 so that we may write $, = $, (z), qk = qk ((z). The param- eters A, in (2.10) are then equal to the spins of the fields $, (z) and are given by where the m, are integers. The fields $, and qk are semilo- cal with ZN ~2,-charges equal to {k, k} and {k, - k), respectively. Unlike local fields, they can have fractional spins and it is natural to refer to $, (z) and $, (2) asparafer- mion currents. The simplest expression for A, that satisfies (2.12) and the requirement A, , = A, is We will henceforth assume that the spins A, of the parafer- mion currents $, are given by (2.13). 3. THE PARAFERMION CURRENT ALGEBRA We will concentrate on the parafermion currents $, (z) (k = 1,2,. . . , N - 1) bearing in mind that all of our results are also valid for & (2). It will be convenient to adjoin the identity operator I to the family {$, } (we set $,,=I) and write $k+ = $N- ,. We consider the operator expansion of the product $, (z) $,. (z') . Since the mutual locality exponent of $, and $, , is equal to - 2kk '/Nand the spins (2.13) satisfy we have for this operator expansion where the fields qFi , ,.,, have ZN xZN charge {k + k ', k + k '1. (Here and below, we understand the sums k + k ' to be modulo N. ) The field , ,,, (z) has spin A, + , , and coincides with the parafermion current $, + , . (z) . We call the scalars c,,, , the structure constants of the parafermionic current algebra; they depend on how the fields $, are norm- laized. We put i.e., c,,_, = 1. The remaining structure constants c,,,. must be found from the associativity condition for the opera- tor algebra (3.2) (see below). We pause to discuss expansion (3.2) with k + k ' = 0 (mod N) more fully. In this expansion \\VF' is equal to the identity operator I and the field q,, (2) has spin 1. If such a field existed in the theory then it would generate the symme- try group U( 1 ), which is bigger than ZN . Since we are inter- ested in the Z, -symmetric critical theory described in Sec. 2, we require that It is natrual to identify the fields (z) of spin 2 with the corresponding component of the energy-momentum tensor of the theory: Y (z) = (~AA/c) T (z) . (3.5) The scalar factor 2Ak /c is necessary for conformal invar- iance3; c is the central charge in the corresponding Virasoro algebra of conformal generators, and is defined by the opera- tor expansion c 2T(z1) 1 T (z) T (2') = + ----- + a,,T (z') +O(l). 2 (z-z') (z-2') Z-z (3.6) The operator expansions defining the algebra of the par- afermion currents $, in the Z, xZN theory have thus the form Q~ (2) gk,+ (Zr) =Ck, (z-z') -2h(N-k')/N [$h-h' (z') +O(z-2') I; k'<k, (3.7b) Ak 1 T(z)$~(z') = -j-qy $h(z')+- Z-z dz.$k(zf)+0(l). (3.8) Equation (3.8) means simply that the fields $, (z) are con- f~rmal.~ The operator expansions (3.7) can be used to explicitly calculate any correlation function We first consider the 2n-point function If we multiply (3.10) by we get an analytic function of the variable z, which (due to the mutual semilocality of the fields $,, $,+, see Sec. 2) is single-valued in the entire complex plane and has second- order poles at the points q,, q2, . . . , 7,. This function is uniquely determined by its residues at these poles, because the condition for $, (z) to be regular as z-co is3 We can use the expansion (3.7~) to evaluate the residues. We find that 217 Sov. Phys. JETP 62 (2), August 1985 A. B. Zarnolodchikov and V. A. Fateev 217 which expresses the 2n-point function (3.10) in terms of (2n - 2)-point functions. We can now use (3.12) to evalu- ate (3.10) by successively decreasing the order of the CF. Of course, any CF (3.9) can then be evaluated from (3.10) by using (3.7). The same CF (3.9) can be evaluated in many different ways; the result will be the same in all cases (i.e., the operator algebra defined by the relations (3.7) will be associative) only if the structure constants c,,, , have the form 2 I'(k+kl+l)r(N-k+l)I'(N-k'+l) ck,kr= (3.13) r(lc+l)r(k1+l)I'(N-k-lc'+i)r(N+1) ' In addition, the parafermion current algebra (3.7) is consis- tent with the conformal Ward identities3 defined by (3.6), (3.8) if the central charge c in (3.6) is equal to We note that the parafermion current algebra con- structed above is not the only possible associative algebra. Appendix A describes an alternative associative ZN -algebra for which the fields @, have different spins. 4. THE SPACE OF FIELDS IN THEZ~X&-THEORY AND REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PARAFERMION CURRENT ALGEBRA The operator algebra of a conformal field theory was formulated in Ref. 3 in terms of a complete set of mutually local fields. For our purposes it will be helpful to enlarge this space by considering a complete set {F} of mutually semilo- cal fields, i.e., one which is closed with respect to the opera- tor algebra. It is natural to assume that the components T(z) and T(2) of the energy-momentum tensor are local with re- spect to all of the fields {F}. In this case the classification in Ref. 3 in terms of the representations of the Virasoro algebra remains valid. The operators L, and En, n = 0, + 1, + 2, . . . , operate on the space {F}; they are associated with the fields T(z) T(T) and satisfy the commutation relations C [L,, L,] = (n-m) L,+,+ - (n3-n)6m+m.0 12 (4.1) (the also satisfy (4.1 ) and commute with L, ). There exist several (possibly infinitely many) semilocal conformal fields #,E{F} which are characterized by two nonnegative numbers (di , ai ) (\"dimensions\") and satisfy the equations Although the sum di + Zi and difference di - ai are equal to the usual anomalous scaling dimension and spin of the field #i, respectively, the spins of the semilocal fields can in general take arbitrary fractional values. All the other fields in {F} can be obtained by repeatedly applying the operators L, , with n < 0 to the conformal fields #i. In the ZN xZN-invariant theory described in Secs. 2 and 3, the field space {F} splits naturally into a direct sum of subspaces with specified 2, ~2,-charges {k, I), where we have expressed the charge {k, 1) in the more con- venient form [q, ij] = [k + I, k - I]. The right and left charges q and ij are defined mod 2N and take arbitrary in- teger values such that q + ij is even. It is convenient to ex- tend the summation in (4.3) over all I - N < q, ij<N, each value of the ZN ~2~-char~e then occurs twice, which ac- counts for the factor 1/2 in (4.3). With these conventions the parafermion currents qk ($, ) have charge [2k, 01 ( [O, 2k]) and It is clear that an arbitrary field I~{F1k,z has spin 2sIk, E,= (kZ-k2)/2N(mod Z), (4.4) and that the mutual locality exponent of any two fields and 4 [,, is equal to In particular, all the fields in {F~,,,] and {PI,, - ,, ) are local, and I, T(z), and T(T) belong to {Flo,oI }. It turns out that the fields spanning the space (4.3) can be classified by the associated representations of the parafer- mion current algebra ( 3.7). Let 4 [, i; ,€{I;; ,, i; be a field of dimension (d, a) and consider the operator expansions m where the exponents in (4.6) are given by (4.5), and A4 and A +# are fields in {F} with 1-k - A-~~-~~E~{~-,~ d+m N~ 4 (4.7b) (the dimensions of the fields are given on the right). The expansions (4.6) define the operators A, and A with 21 8 Sov. Phys. JETP 62 (2), August 1985 A. 0. Zarnolodchikov and V. A. Fateev 218 I-k p= (mod Z) ; they act on the space {F} as follows: A(:-~)/N+~: {F[k,~]) -f {F1k-l,~l). (4.8b) The fields in the expansion (4.6) can also be represented conveniently in the form Proceeding in the same way with the currents q,(z) and - $: (3, we can define operators xc and 2 F+ with l+k y= - I-k N (mod Z) , p= --- (mod Z) ; N they act on {F) but differ from Eqs. (4.6)-(4.9) only in that z and k replaced by - 5 and x. We have considered only the currents $,, $:, $,, and $:, because according to (3.7) the full algebra of the parafermion currents $, , 3, is unique- ly determined by the algebra generated by the operators, A, A +,A,A+. We find the commutation relations defining the opera- tor algebra A, A + by considering the double integral where the exponents are chosen so that the integrand is sin- gle-valued in z,, z,. The integration paths C, and C, are shown in Fig. 2. The integral (4.10) can be evaluated by two different methods. We can first integrate overz, and then use Eqs. (4.9) to do the z, integration. In the second method we must first deform the contour C, in Fig. 2 so that it lies inside C,. In this case account must be taken of the contribution of the pole z, = z, to the z,-integral; the residue is given by Eq. (3.7~) in terms of the field T(z). Equating the results of both methods, we find that FIG. 2. Paths of integration with respect to z, and z,. where the binomial coefficients are given by We have used (2.13) and (3.14) for the parameters A, and c in deriving (4.1 1 ) . Similarly, we find by considering the in- tegral that The operators A + of course satisfy the same \"commutation\" relations, with k replaced by - k. We recall that according to (4.7) the fields A,+ and A,+ have dimensions (d - Y, d) and (d -p, 7) if 4 has dimension (d, d). The requirement that the dimensions of the fields be bounded from below therefore implies that there exist fields which are annihilated by all operators A,, A with Y, p > 0. We use the equations with n>O to define N scalar fields (order parameters) a, E{F[,, }, k = 0, 1, . . . , N - 1, for the Z, xZN theory. If we apply Eq. (4.11 ) with n = m = 0 to the fields a, and use (4.14), we immediately find the dimensions Similarly, the dual fields p, ECF~,, - ,, ) (disorder param- eters) can be defined by the equations with n>O. Their dimensions are of course also given by (4.15). All the fields spanning the space {F} can be obtained by - - successively applying the operators A, A +, A, A + to the fields a,. The independent fields obtained in this way from a, generate an irreducible representation [a, 1, of the para- fermion-current algebra (4.1 1 ), (4.13 ), and the space {F} is represented by the direct sum N-I {F)= @ [oh]*. (4.17) k=O In general, the number of irreducible representations of the Virasoro algebra in (4.17) is infinite. An exception occurs when N = 2 or 3; these cases are related to the minimal mod- els in the principal series with p = 3, 5 (see the Introduc- tion). The dimensions of the fields generating {F} can be de- scribed as follows. Each \"spin\" field a, corresponds in a natural way to a series of fields +[:, , (q = - k, - k + 2, . . . ,2N - k - 2) defined by 219 Sov. Phys. JETP 62 (2), August 1985 A. 0. Zamolodchikov and V. A.

Applying the operators and 2 + in analogy with (4.18 ) we can construct the system of \"principal\" semilocal fields q5;::, (q, ij = k mod 22) of dimension (d iq', d iq)). According to (4.181, the quantities dp', k=0, 1, 2,. . . , N- 1, aregivenby We note that all the fields q5f:,b are mutually local (in particular, they are local with respect to the \"spins\" a, ). Of particular interest among them are the ZN xZN-neutral fields. They exist for even k = 2 j: E\"' = 4fzA and have di- mensions (D, , D, ) where The Dj clearly describe the \"thermal\" exponents for a self- dual critical point of the 2,-theory. A1 the other fields in {F) have dimensions that differ by integers from (4.19). 5. OPERATOR ALGEBRA AND CORRELATION FUNCTIONS As in the \"minimal models\" of Ref. 3, the correlation functions for the \"principal\" fields in the described ZN X ZN -theory all satisfy linear differential equations of a particular form. In principle these equations can be derived directly by using Eqs. (4.2), (4.1 I), (4.14), and (4.18). However, it is more convenient to exploit the following re- markable fact. The algebra defined by (3.7), (3.13) for the parafernion currents $, (z) is closely related to the Kac- Moody su(2) algebra (current algebra)23,4' in which N plays the role of the central stage. The 2, xZ,-theory can be regaged in the standard way as a \"reduction\" of an h su(2) ~su(2)-invariant field theory; the latter theory de- scribes a conformally invariant solution of the two-dimen- sional SU(2) XSU(2)-chiral Wess-Zumino model13 and will be called the WZ theory. The field dimensions, operator algebras, and correlation functions for the two theories are related in a very simple way. The fundamental formulas for the WZ theory are given in Appendix B. We now introduce the free massless Bose field $(z, 2) satisfying the equation a, a, q5 = 0, i.e., where the \"right\" and \"left\" free fields q5 and 4 are uniquely defined by their two-point functions <cp(z)cp(O))=-2logz; (ql(T)ql(O)>=-2logT; (cp (z) ql (0) ) =O (5.2). (5.2) The components T(O) (z) = (d,cp (z) )Z, T(O) (z) = (alq (z) ) (5.3) of the corresponding energy-momentum tensor generate a Virasoro algebra (3.6) with central charge We consider a conformal field theory which splits into the ZN XzN-theory described in Secs. 2-4 plus a free field (5.1) which does not interact with the Z, xZN-fields. We define new fields by where : : denotes the usual normal ordering. The arguments of the exponentials in (5.5) are chosen so that all three \"cur- rents\" Ja (a = 0, + , - ) have dimensions ( l, 0). One can readily verify the operator expansions where qaB and f given by Eqs. (B.2). The total energy- momentum tensor of this \"composite\" theory is TI0' (2) =T (z) +T(O) (2) , (5.7) where T(z) is the energy-momentum tensor for the ZN xzN-theory defined by Eq. (3.712); Ttot satisfies theVir- asoro-algebra relation (3.6) with [here we have used (3.14) and (5.4) 1. A straightforward verification reveals that Ttot is related to the currents (5.5) 220 Sov. Phys. JETP 62 (2), August 1985 A. B. Zamolodchikov and V. A. Fateev 220 by (N+ 2) Tfof (z) =qGR:P (z) Jyz) : . (5.9) Comparison of Eqs. (5.6) and (5.9) with (B.11 and (B.6) shows that the currents (5.5) generate the su(2) Kac- Moody algebra, and the \"composite\" and WZ theories coin- cide. The simple formula can be derived without difficulty; it expresses a simple rela- tion between the invariant fields Qg', of the WZ theory (see Appendix B) and the \"principal\" ZN xZN -theory fields defined in Sec. 4. The dimension (Dj , Dj ) of @'j' is the sum of the dimension (d ijm', d i;\")) of the field Q[~~,,, and the dimension of the exponential in (5.10), i.e., in agreement with (4.19) and (B. 11 ). Equation (5.10) im- plies the formula which relates the correlation functions for the WZ and ZN xZN -theories. We can use (5.12) to immediately de- duce all the structure constants of the operator algebra and some of the correlation functions of the ZN xZN-theory from the corresponding results for the WZ theory (see Ap- pendix B ) . The 3-point function of the \"spin\" fields, normalized by has the form <ok, ('1, j1) Ok, ('2, '2) ('3, '3)) wherez,, = z, - z,, etc.; the structure constants are given by The surprising similarity of (5.15) to Eq. (3.13) is noteworthy. The function where is another interesting 3-point function that includes nonlo- cal fields. Here the fields $, and a, are assumed normalized by (3.3) and (5.13), respectively; the fields pk are normalized by the same formula ( 5.13 ). With this normalization, Eq. (2.10) must of course also contain the constant Q, . We also state some results for some of the 4-point func- tions of the theory: where are the standard projective invariants and x F(') (k, x) F(L) (k, 5) x F(') (k, x) F(2) (k, Z) (5.20) Here F\"' and F\"' are hypergeometric functions: The 4-point function describing the mutual correlations of the fields p, and a, is given by <pi (z,, 51) (~2, ~2) ok(~33 zS)O~+ (z&?

The other CFs are expressible gen- erally speaking in terms of the multiple integrals introduced in Ref. 7. In conclusion, we note that the close relationship to the WZ theory discussed in this section can also be used to prove that the positivity condition6 is valid for the ZN ~2~ theor- ies. 1 The dual transformation for the model (6. I), (6.3) is carried out by the standard te~hnique.'~-'~ The \"spins\" or are replaced by the \"dual spins\" pi associated with the nodes I. of the dual lattice 2, and the dual-spin interaction is again described by Eqs. (6.1) and (6.3) with 6. DISCUSSION The system is self-dual if In this paper we have constructed a conformal field the- ory which is ZN-invariant and possesses order-disorder symmetry (self-duality). We now consider the problem of describing the statistical models with this type of critical behavior. As noted in the Introduction, the dimensions (4. IS), (4.20) coincide with the exponents characterizing the \"antiferromagnetic\" critical points of the RSOS mod- els.\".\" In addition, it seems plausible that our solution might describe the self-dual critical points for the generaliza- tions of the Ising model to ZN . Although these Z,-models have been widely discussed in the literat~re,'\"'~,~~-~~ it . will be helpful to examine them here in the context of the above formalism. We associate with each node r in a square lattice L a variable ur that takes on the values wq , q = 0, 1, . . . , N - 1, where w is defined by Eq. (2.1 ). If we assume that only near- est neighbors interact, we can write the partition function in the form where e, = el, e, are basis vectors ofL, and the \"pair Hamil- tonian\" H(u, a') must be chosen so that the theory is ZN- symmetric and C-invariant: The function W(a, a') can then be expressed as with real nonnegative coefficients satisfying w, = wN-, (we set w, = 1). The interaction in this system (2, Ising One can show that Eqs. (6.5) define a hyperplane of dimen- sions int (N/4) in the parameter space {w,}. For N = 2, 3 the model (6.1 ), (6.3) coincides with the standard Z, Ising and Z, Potts models, and in this case con- dition (6.5) defines the critical points. Figure 4a shows a phase diagram of the Z4 Ising model, which is a special case of the Ashkin-Teller model.\" The self-dual Z4-models are described by the line and the model can be solved exactly for these parameter val- ue~.~~*~~ All the points on segment AB of the line (6.6) are critical, and the exponents vary continuously along AB. One can show that AB contains a point C, defined by sin (n/16) WI = w2=1-2wi, sin (3n/ 16) ' at which the critical theory is described5' by ZN ~2,-theory with N = 4. Figure 4b shows a phase diagram for the Z5 Ising model. The \"self-dual line\" FB, defined by the equa- tion model) is thus described by real parameters w,, k = 1, 2, FIG. 4. Phase diagrams for the Z, (a) and Z, models (b). FB is the self- ' . . , GN/2, whose number int (N/2) stands for the integer duality line. Phases I, 11, and 111 correspond to the following values: I) part. (a) #O, 01) = 0; 11) (a) = 0, (p) #O; 111) (a) = 01) = 0. 222 Sov. Phys. JETP 62 (2), August 1985 A. B. Zamolodchikov and V. A. Fateev 222 contains two symmetrically located \"bifurcation points\" C and C * which in all probability are critical.,' The self-dual ZN Ising models were shown in Ref. 26 to be completely integrable if k-1 sin (nl/N+n/4N) w'=' sin(nil+l)/N-n/4~) . (6.9) 1=0 Our hypothesis is that the points (6.9) in the phase diagrams of theZN -models are critical and described by the conformal ZN xZN-theories constructed in this paper. Of course, this hypothesis requires verification. In particular, it would be interesting to carry out a numerical renormalization-group analysis of the neighborhoods of the points (6.9). If our hy- pothesis is correct, the corresponding \"thermal\" exponents should be as given by Eq. ( 1.4). We note here that the num- ber of \"energy\" operators dJ' in the ZN xZN-theory is equal to the dimension of the phase space for the ZN Ising model. APPENDIX A We consider a conformal theory with parafermion cur- rents $, (z), k = l, 2, . . . , N - l, of dimension (A,, 0) where Ak=AN-k. (A. 1) We assume that the operator algebra for the currents $, is consistent with ZN-symmetry and is described as in (3.7) by the expansions Here the coefficients dZ $ and T(z) are specified by the con- formal symmetry requirement,, c is the central charge of the Virasoro algebra, the Z.,,, , are the structure constants, and $,+ = $,-, . We see from (A.2) that the mutual locality exponent of the fields $, and $, . is equal to Yk, h'=Ak+h'- Ah-- Ak. (A.3) which is consistent with the operator algebra (A.2) pro- vided the dimensions A, satisfy Using (A. 1 ), we find that the general solution of (A.4) is of the form wherep and M, (k = 1,2, . . . , N - 1 ) are arbitrary integers subject to MN-, = M,. The simplest solution (p = 1, 223 Sov. Phys. JETP 62 (2), August 1985 M, = 0) was examined in the main part of this paper. Here we will present another solution of the associativity algebra (A.2) for which With this choice the solution contains a single free param- eter A; the structure constants are given by where the c,,, , are defined by (3.13), and the central charge is given by 4(N-I) (Nfh-1)h c= (N+2h) (N+2h-2) ' (A.8) The study ofthe representations of this algebra (and in parti- cular, of the positivity condition6) lies beyond the scope of this paper. We merely note that for A = 1/2 the algebra (A.2), (A.5)-(A.7) coincides with the \"even\" subalgebra of the Z,,-algebra (3.7) (Z.+,. = c,,,,,. ), while forA = 1 it coincides with the \"square\" of the ZN-algebra (3.7) (C,,,. = c;,, . ). Finally, for N = 3 and /Z = 1/4 this algebra arises in the minimal model withp = 6 (\"tricritical Z, Potts model\"). APPENDIX B Here we will derive the funda2ental foArmulas for a con- formal theory invariant under the su(2) ~su(2) current al- gebra. Because this theory describes a conformally invariant solution of the two-dimensional Wess-Zumino we will call it the WZ theory. Some additional details may be found in Ref. 13. The WZ theory contains local fields (\"currents\") Ja (z), Ja (5) (a = 0, + , - ), for which the operator ex- pansions hold, where the f ;o are the structure constants of su (2) and the tensor qao is given by the associated Killing form. The nonzero components are given by fW'--f+ +- +- O--fO:=f-\"I, The parameter Nin (B. 1 ) is called the central charge of the current algebra and takes positive integer values, since oth- erwise the algebra (B. 1 ) would not have any suitable unitary representations. Let {A) be a complete space of mutually local fields describing the WZ theory. The action of the operators JE, n = 0, + 1, * 2, . . . , on {A) is then determined by where cP is any field in {A} and the integration path encloses the point z = 0. The expansion (B. 1) implies that the J,\" obey the commutation relation N [lna, I,B] =fTa81A, + - nqaB6,+m,o 2 (B.4) A. 9. Zamolodchikov and V. A. Fateev 223 and therefore form a Kac-Moody algebra. The operators 7: are defined just as in (B.3) [with P (z) replaced by (Z)] and also satisfy (B.4); moreover, 5and J commute. The op- erators J,\" and 5,\" thus generate a global SU(2) xSU(2) - symmetry of the WZ theory; the corresponding Casimir op- erators are where qaBp = 6; are called the \"right\" and \"left\" isoto- pic spins, respectively. The component pWZ' (z) (Fm' (Z)) of the energy- momentum tensor of the WZ theory can be expressed qua- dratically in terms of the currents J\" (z) (J\" (Z) ) : where the product of fields on the right-hand side is regular- ized in the standard way by subtracting the singular term of the operator expansion.13 The corresponding operators L AWZ' are given by and generate a Virasoro algebra (4.1 ) with central charge The symbol : : in (B.7) denotes the standard normal order- ing in which operators J,, with n < 0 appear on the left. The space {A) contains invariant fields @\"', j = 0, I/ 2, 1, 3/2, . . . , satisfying the equations Each invariant field @\"'E{A) is an SU(2) xSU(2) tensor - with (2j + 1)' components Qz', (m, m = -j, -j + 1, . . . , j) that can be found from the equations (j) 0 mm- m@,L mmr ~,o@:!~~=fi@ ,,=. (B. 10) The fields have the same dimension (D, , D, ) regard- less of m, ;, where The @( I' can be orthonormalized as follows: <@;!:A, (z, Z) @::!iii2 (0,O) ) Taken together, the independent fields obtained from a giv- en invariant field Q\"' by successive application of the oper- ators J:, 5: with n < 0 form a subspace [F'j' ],E~A) which corresponds to the highest weight of the su (2) Xsu (2) cur- rent algebra. The correlation functions of the invariant fields in the WZ theory satisfy the linear differential equations i'ti x (o(Jl) (z,, TI) . . . @(In) (z,,, T.) )=O, where the (2jk + 1 ) X (2jk + 1 ) matrices S = S zk,mir act on the \"right\" tensor indices m, of the field @y:kk and cor- respond to the su (2)-algebra representation of spin j, : [Sku7 St]=f aT~kTl qUBSkaSkP=jk(jk+l). (B. 14) The equations that follows from (B. 13) by replacing z by Z are of course also valid; in this case the matrices S, act on the \"left\" indices i, of the fields @\"\". One can show that for a fixed central charge N in (B. 1 ), the space {A) contains exactly N + 1 invariant fields @(\" , j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . . , N/2, where the field @'O' coincides with the identity operator I. Moreover, {A) is the direct sum NIZ {A)= @ [@(j'IJ, and the fields on the right-hand side generate a closed opera- tor algebra. For example, the product of two invariant fields is expanded in the form @'j\" m,, - m, (z, 2) 0: ,, (0, 0) where at j1>j2 the sum over j contains terms with j=j,-j2-k, k=0, 1, ..., min (2j2, N-2j,). The square brackets [acJ' 1, in (B. 16) denote the contribution from all fields in the corresponding subspace; the field @;f;; occurs with multiplicity I, while the coefficients multiplying the 0th: fields in [@\"' 1, are uniquely specified by the A su(2) Xsu (2) symmetry requirement. The numerical con- stants C are called the structure constants of the operator algebra.
