You should upload your solutions to this problem sheet on the VGLA Canvas page. The deadline is 5pm on 11th December 2024. Remember that you should always carefully write out your solutions giving full explanations (not just stating the answer). Also, submissions should consist of a single pdf ﬁle. Q1. Suppose that z1 = 1 + i. (i) Calculate z8 1 in both modulus-argument form and exponential form giving the principal value of the argument. (ii) Find all the ﬁfth roots of z1. Present your answers in exponential form giving the principal value of the argument. Q2. Consider the polynomial p(z) = z3 − z2 + 9z − 9. (i) Determine the roots of p(z). (ii) Write p(z) as a product of real linear and real irreducible quadratic factors. Q3. The circle of radius r in the xy-plane centred at (a, b) ∈ R2 is described by the equation (x − a) 2 + (y − b) 2 = r2. Describe the solution set to the equation |z − 1| = 4|z − 3| (where z ∈ C) as a geometrically deﬁned subset of the Argand diagram. Q4. Is the following system of linear equations homogeneous? Justify your answer. 2x1 − 7(x4 + 1) − 3x2 = 2(x3 + 3) − 13 x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 0 (x1 + 1) − 2(x2 − 2) + x3 = 5 Q5. We deﬁne the following matrices: A =   1 −1 2 1 3 −1 −1 1 4   B =  −2 1 0 0 1 2 4 −1 2   C =   6 1 2 0 −1 1   . For each of the following matrix calculations, either do the calculation or explain why it is not possible to do the calculation.
