Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. No calculator is permitted in this examination. Page 1 Turn over No Calculator Section A 1. (a) The displacement x(t) of a mass m attached to a spring obeys the equation of motion, ¨x + γ ˙x + ω 2x = F(t) m , where γ ≥ 0 and ω > 0 are constants and F(t) is a driving force. Let the mass have initial displacement x(0) = x0 > 0 and initial velocity v(0) = 0. (i) Let γ = 0 and F(t) = 0. Find x(t). (ii) Let γ = 0 and F(t) = F0 cos(ωt), where F0 > 0 is a constant. Verify that the function x(t) = C cos(ωt) + F0 2mω t sin(ωt), where C is any constant, satisfies the equation of motion and the initial condition v(0) = 0. Determine C. Describe how x(t) behaves in the limit t → ∞. (iii) Let γ > 0 and F(t) = F0 cos(ωt), where F0 > 0 is a constant. Without finding x(t), describe how x(t) behaves in the limit t → ∞ and justify your answer. [25] (b) A particle of mass m moves under gravity along a coil of frictionless wire in the shape of an elliptical helix. The Cartesian coordinates of the particle are x(t) = a cos θ (t), y(t) = b sin θ (t), z(t) = cθ (t), where θ (t) is some function of t, and a, b and c are positive constants with a > b. (i) Find the particle’s velocity vector, and hence show that 1 2m ˙θ 2 ( a2 sin 2 θ + b 2 cos 2 θ + c 2) + mgcθ = E, where E is a constant. (ii) Let the particle be initially stationary at position θ (0) = 0. Find an expression for ˙θ 2. Assuming that the particle never stops after it is released, show that θ (t) < 0 for all t > 0. (iii) Show that ˙θ 2 has a local maximum or local minimum whenever (a2 − b2) ( sin2 θ − θ sin(2θ ) ) + b 2 + c 2 = 0. (⋆) Show that (⋆) holds for infinitely many values of θ < 0, and interpret this result. [25] A38707 Page 2 Turn over No Calculator Section B 2. In plane polar coordinates (r, θ ), a particle of mass m is attracted towards the origin by a central force of magnitude maω 2 (a3 r3 + a2 r2 e −a/r) , where a and ω are positive constants. (a) Explain why a must have the dimensions of length. Derive the dimensions of ω. [4] (b) Let u = 1/r. Starting from Newton’s Second Law, show that the quantity h = r2 ˙θ is a constant, and that the particle’s path satisfies d2u dθ 2 + u = aω 2 h2 (a3u + a 2e −au). (†) You may assume the following expressions for the particle’s velocity ˙r and acceleration ¨r: ˙r = ˙rer + r ˙θ eθ , ¨r = (¨r − r ˙θ 2) er + 1 r ( d dt ( r2 ˙θ ) ) eθ . [16] (c) Let the particle’s initial position be given by [r]t=0 = a and [θ ]t=0 = 0, and let its initial velocity be [˙r]t=0 = aω eθ . Find the value of h, and the values of u and du dθ at θ = 0. [10] (d) Let a = 1 in some arbitrary units. Verify that the function u(θ ) = 1 + log ( cosh2(cθ ) ) , (‡) where c is any constant, satisfies the initial conditions for u and du dθ at θ = 0. Find the value of c > 0 such that (‡) solves (†). You may use the following without proof: d dX sinh(X) = cosh(X), d dX cosh(X) = sinh(X), cosh2(X) − sinh 2(X) = 1. [12] (e) Assume that the particle path is given by (‡), with c > 0. Show that ˙θ is a strictly increasing function of θ , and hence explain why θ → ∞ as t → ∞. What happens to r as t → ∞? Justify your answer. Draw a sketch of the particle path in the (r, θ ) plane.
