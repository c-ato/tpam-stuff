The current is the integral of the current density j(r) = j0 r a , therefore: I = ∫ b a j(r)2πrdr [1 mark] = 2π 3a j0 (b3 − a3) . [1 mark] 2. We will use Ampere’s law to derive the magnetic ﬁeld: ∮ ⃗B · d⃗l = µ0I , where I is the current linked to (enclosed by) the closed loop. (a) r < a: no current linked, therefore B = 0 [1 mark] (b) a ≤ r ≤ b: 2πrB(r) = ∫ r a j(r)2πrdr = 2π 3a µ0j0 [ r3]r a B(r) = µ0j0 3a 1 r ( r3 − a3) . [1 mark] (c) r > b: B = µ0I 2πr = µ0j0 3a 1 r ( b3 − a3) [1 mark] Problem 2. 1. B and I are perpendicular to each other, therefore the force on an element dr of the rod is: dF = IB dr . The torque is: d⃗τB = ⃗r × d ⃗F and due to the fact that ⃗r ⊥ ⃗F : dτB = rdF = r(IBdr) . Integrating, the torque is: τB = ∫ L 0 dτB = IB ∫ L 0 rdr = 1 2 IBL 2 Putting in the numerical values: τb = [ 6.5 × 0.34 × 0.2 2 2 ] N m = 0.044 N m [1 mark] The torque tends to rotate the rod clockwise. [1 mark] 2. The rod is in equilibrium when the torque from B is balanced by the torque, τS, produced by the spring: |FS| = k∆x , τS = k∆xL sin α α = 53 o [1 mark] Therefore at equilibrium: τB = τS , hence: ∆x = τB kL sin α [1 mark] The energy stored in the spring is: U = 1 2 k(∆x)2 = 1 2k ( τB kL sin α )2 = τ 2 B 2kL2 sin2 α = [ (0.044) 2 2 × 4.8 × (0.2)2 [sin(53π/180)] 2 ] J = 0.008 J [1 mark]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
