A current I (ignore resistance) circulates anticlockwise in the loop. Point P is directly above the middle of side (4) at distance r ≫ a from the centre of the loop, as seen in the ﬁgure below. The loop and P are in the (x, y) plane, with the z-axis of the coordinate system pointing out of the page. 1. Explain why the magnitudes of the magnetic ﬁeld, B, at P generated by the current ﬂowing through sides (1) and (3) are negligible compared to those from sides (2) and (4). The Biot-Savart Law can be used to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld: δB = µ0 4π I r2 δl ∧ ˆr [1 Mark] where δl is in the direction of the current and ˆr is from the element δl to point P . Note to markers: 1 mark for using Biot-Savart Law anywhere in this problem. As r ≫ a, sides (1) and (3) are almost parallel to ˆr hence δl ∧ ˆr ≈ 0 =⇒ B ≈ 0 [1 Mark] Likewise, the sides (2) and (4) are almost perpendicular to ˆr and as a ≪ r we can approximate a ≈ δl hence |δl ∧ ˆr| ≈ |a ∧ ˆr| ≈ a =⇒ B ≈ µ0 4π Ia r2 [1 Mark] therefore magnetic ﬁeld from each of (1) and (3) individually is much less than from each of (2) and (4). 2. Determine the total contribution from the current ﬂowing through sides (2) and (4) to B(P ) to leading order in (a/r) (magnitude and direction). The magnetic ﬁelds from sides (2) and (4) are in the opposite direction. B2 is out of the page and B4 is into the page. As a ≪ r: B2 ≈ µ0I 4π a (r + a 2 )2 ≈ µ0I 4π a r2 (1 − a r ) Likewise, for side 4: B4 ≈ µ0I 4π a (r − a 2 )2 ≈ µ0I 4π a r2 (1 + a r ) to order a r . B2 + B4 = µ0I 4π a r2 [(1 − a r ) − (1 + a r )] ˆz. = µ0I 4π a r2 ( −2a r ) ˆz = −µ0I 2π a2 r3 ˆz [3 Marks] Note to markers: 1 mark for direction (−ˆz) or stating “ﬁeld into page”). 1 mark for the a2 r3 term, and 1 mark for the correct expression with all numerical factors. 3. Determine the total contribution from the current ﬂowing through sides (1) and (3) to B(P ) to leading order in (a/r) (magnitude and direction). Sides (1) and (3) also make a small contribution to the magnetic ﬁeld at P . Consider side (3): |δl ∧ ˆr| = δl sin θ ≈ a sin θ ≈ a tan θ = aa/2 r = a2 2r to leading order a r . Therefore B3 ≈ µ0I 4π 1 r2 a2 2r ˆz The contribution is out of the page (positive ˆz) The contribution from side (1) is also out of the page and is the same as side (3). Therefore B1 + B3 = 2B3 = µ0I 4π a2 r3 ˆz [3 Marks] Note to markers: 1 mark for direction (+ˆz) or stating “ﬁeld out of page”). 1 mark for the a2 r3 term, and 1 mark for the correct expression with all numerical factors. 4. Hence, determine the total magnetic ﬁeld B(P ) from the whole loop to leading order in (a/r). Hence total B-ﬁeld at P is: µ0I 4π a2 r3 ˆz − 2µ0I 4π a2 r3 ˆz = −µ0I 4π I a2 r3 ˆz [1 Mark]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
