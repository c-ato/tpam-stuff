Only true for a fluid of constant density 𝜌! 𝑃0 ℎ 𝑃 = 𝑃0 + 𝜌𝑔ℎ Needs units of pressure, so force/area [kg][m]-3 [m][s]-2 [m] → [kg][m][s]-2/[m]2 Fluid dynamics If I apply a force to the liquid shown in this container here, what will happen? Pressure in the liquid will increase, so applied force to the walls of the container increases! Pascal’s law: If pressure is applied to an enclosed fluid, the pressure is applied equally (and undiminished) to every part of the fluid and the walls of enclosure. Applied force/pressureHydraulic presses If a force 𝐹1 is applied to a liquid through some relatively small area, 𝑎1, then the pressure determined by these quantities must be applied at all points to the liquid 𝑃 = 𝐹1/𝑎1 Therefore 𝑃 = 𝐹2/𝑎2 𝐹1 𝑎1 𝐹2 𝑎2 𝐹2 = 𝐹1𝑎2 𝑎1 Q: incompressible fluid, with cross- sectional area a1 of 0.25 m2. On the other side, the cross sectional area is 2.5 m2. What force is required to lift a 1 tonne car? A: 980 N (100 kg of mass equivalent) Fluid flowing through a pipe In the steady state (unchanged with respect to time), the amount of water that passes a given point should always be the same at any time… Speed of the flow depends on the area of the pipe, such that 𝐴1𝑣1 = 𝐴2𝑣2 𝐴1 𝐴2𝑣1 𝑣2 For a change in speed, we require an acceleration and hence a force This force comes from the neighbouring water, but how does this affect pressure? Bernoulli’s equation Before, we had To include the velocity, we need the pressure from the kinetic energy (think back to our gravitational pressure term) 𝑃 = 𝑃0 + 𝜌𝑔ℎ Constant = 𝑃 + 𝜌𝑔ℎ + 1 2 𝜌𝑣2 Static pressure Hydrostatic pressure Dynamic pressure Bernoulli’s equation example Water enters the pipe at a speed of 1.5 ms-1 and pressure 4 x 105 Pa through a pipe of diameter 2 cm. It then travels through a pipe of diameter 1 cm to a tap in a bathroom 5 metres above. What speed does the water flow out when the tap is opened? What is the pressure at the tap? Constant = 𝑃 + 𝜌𝑔ℎ + 1 2 𝜌𝑣2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
