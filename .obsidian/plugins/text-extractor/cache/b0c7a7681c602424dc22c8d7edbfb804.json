Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. No calculator is permitted in this examination. Page 1 Turn over No Calculator Section A 1. (a) Consider the equation ∫ u dt = mg + ¨x, where u is velocity, t is time, m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, x is distance and double dot denotes the second derivative with respect to time. Is this equation dimension- ally homogeneous? Justify your answer. [2] (b) If a particle of mass m is subject to a force of the form F = F0 cos (ωt), where F0 and ω are constants and t is time, find the acceleration, velocity and position of the particle as a function of time, given the particle starts at x = 0 with constant velocity u. [6] (c) Starting from Newton’s Second Law, show that d dt (r × ˙r) = 0 for a particle moving under the action of a central force, where r is position, m is mass and t is time. Hence, prove that the motion is constrained to lie in a plane. [5] (d) Formulate a complete model system for a situation where a particle of mass m is acted on by an outward pointing central force of the form F(r) = − α r2 + β r3 , where α and β are constants. The particle is initially located a distance a from the centre of the force, moving with radial velocity v and transverse velocity w. You may assume that ˙r = ˙rer + r ˙θ eθ for a position vector r in polar coordinates, ˙r = −h du dθ and d2u dθ 2 + u = −F(1/u) mh2u2 , where u = 1/r and you should carefully define h. Note that you are not asked to solve the resulting model. [12] A38707 Page 2 Turn over No Calculator Section B 2. (a) First consider a particle of mass m moving in a straight line with position x. Starting from Newton’s second law, prove the principle of Conservation of Energy for a force that depends only on x. [5] Please turn over for the rest of the question. A38707 Page 3 Turn over No Calculator (b) Now consider a particle of mass m at position P(θ ,t) moving on a smooth wire shaped in a circle of radius a lying in a vertical plane, where θ is the polar angle that the particle makes with the centre of the circle O measured from the upwards vertical and t is time. The particle is attached to one end of a spring (spring constant k, natural length a/2) with the other end of the spring attached to the top of the wire T (θ = 0). See Figure 1. Figure 1: Sketch of the wire, mass and spring system for part (b), showing the top of the circle T (θ = 0), the particle at point P(θ ,t) and the origin O at the centre of the circle. (i) Show that the kinetic energy of the particle is given by 1 2ma 2 ˙θ 2, where dot denotes the first derivative with respect to time. (ii) Show that the extension in the spring is given by 2a sin (θ 2 ) − a 2 . (iii) Find the height of the particle above the centre of the circle. (iv) Hence, show that the total energy of the system is given by 1 2ma 2 ˙θ 2 + mga cos θ + ka2 2 ( 2 sin (θ 2 ) − 1 2 )2 = E. (v) If the particle starts from rest at θ = π/3, find the value of θ when the particle will stop again. You may leave your answer in terms of a trigonometric function for θ . [20] [Hint: Recall that sin π 6 = 1 2 , sin π 3 = √ 3 2 and cos 2θ = 1 − 2 sin2 θ .] A38707 Page 4 End of paper This page is intentionally blank.
