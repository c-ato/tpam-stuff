The magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the area, A, of the loop. When the bar has reached a generic velocity v the magnitude of the emf is: |ϵ| = dΦ dt = B dA dt [1 mark] = B L v dt dt = BLv [1 mark] 2. The terminal velocity vt is reached when Fg = FB , [1 mark] where: Fg = mg sin α [1 mark] and FB = BLI = BL ϵ R = BL BLv R = (BL) 2v R . [1 mark] Hence: mg sin α = (BL) 2vt R and vt = R (BL)2 mg sin α [1 mark] 3. The energy is dissipated at a rate: Pe = ϵI = BLvt R BLvt = (BLvt) 2 R [1 mark] and the rate at which the gravitational force is doing work is: Pg = ⃗Fg · ⃗vt = mg(sin α)vt [1 mark] now substitution the value for vt Pe = [BL R (BL)2 mg sin α]2 1 R = R (BL)2 (mg sin α) 2 [1 mark] and Pg = (mg sin α) R (BL)2 (mg sin α) = R (BL)2 (mg sin α)2 [1 mark] which shows that: Pe = Pg , which are the same","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
