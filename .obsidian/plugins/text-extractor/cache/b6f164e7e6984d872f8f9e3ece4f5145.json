The ones with ♣ are the hardest ones, which might only occur as a \"sting in the tail\" at the end of a long examination question. Problem 5.1 Two-level gas Consider a volume of gas at 27 ◦C. The atoms of the gas can exist in only two energy states, one being an energy E above the other. Calculate the fraction of atoms in the higher energy state 1. if E = 1 eV, 2. if E = 0.1 eV and 3. if E = 0.01 eV. Problem 5.2 Sketching Maxwell-Boltzmann Sketch the probability distribution for the y-component of velocity of the molecules of a gas at temperature T . Problem 5.3 Speed versus velocity Sketch the probability distribution for the speed of the molecules of a gas at temperature T . Why is the shape of this distribution diﬀerent from that of (2) above ? Problem 5.4 Internal energy of a gas Internal energy of a gas, U (T ) = ( 1 2kbT ) × (?) × (number of molecules) . What is the missing term? What is its value for a monatomic gas? The next problem is a little mathematical so has a ♣, but the results can be used straightfor- wardly – for example in the following questions. ♣Problem 5.5 Approximations for probabilities As was observed in the lectures, it is impossible in general to provide an exact, analytic, expression for the probability that a molecule in a gas at temperature T is travelling faster than v0, say. This must be determined numerically. However if v0 ≫ ⟨|v|⟩ or if 0 < v0 ≪ ⟨|v|⟩, useful approximations may be made. Two results from integration (which are illustrations of general techniques for approximating integrals) follow. Consider the function f (x) = e −αx2, so there is a natural scale for x, α−1/2. We will now approximate F (x) = ∫ ∞ x dy f (y) , 5 KINETIC THEORY 2 (i) x ≫ α −1/2.. Write F (x) = ∫ ∞ x dy e−αy2 = ∫ ∞ x dy −2αy −2αy e −αy2 , then judiciously group symbols and integrate by parts twice to show that: F (x) = e−αx2 2αx − 1 (2α)2 e−αx2 x3 + · · · (5.1) ≃ e−αx2 2αx ( 1 − 1 2αx2 ) . (5.2) Note that α1/2x ≫ 1 so this expansion looks useful. (ii) x ≪ α −1/2. Firstly rewrite F (x), with x > 0, F (x) = ∫ ∞ x dy e −αy2 = ∫ ∞ 0 dy e −αy2 − ∫ x 0 dy e−αy2 . The ﬁrst term is known, and for the second term note the region of integration, x ≪ α−1/2. How may we exploit that to evaluate the integral approximately? Hence show that F (x) ∼ x→0 1 2 √ π α − x + αx3 3 − · · · ≃ 1 √ α (√π 2 − α1/2x + (α1/2x)3 3 ) . (5.3) Since α1/2x ≪ 1 this approximation also appears useful. Problem 5.6 A languid cyclist A cyclist is cycling at 5 ms −1 in a straight line in the x-direction. What fraction of the molecules in the atmosphere have vx < 5 ms −1? [Decide which approximation from the previous problem to use.] Problem 5.7 Hot air – the leaky Earth What is the escape velocity from Earth? Assuming molecules of nitrogen, 14N2, in the atmosphere do not collide with each other and have a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at room temperature (say 300 K), what fraction will escape from the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld? How does this fraction diﬀer for 3He, 4He and 14N2 molecules? Is this a credible reason for the disparities of of abundance of these entities in the atmosphere? (Consult the Web to ﬁnd the Earthly isotopic abundances.) Problem 5.8 Counterpart to equipartition for diﬀerent potential shapes The aim is to derive the counterpart to 1 2kbT per degree of freedom for potential energy of the form Vn(x) = V0|x| n, with n > 0 and V0 > 0. 5 KINETIC THEORY 3 The Boltzmann factor for Vn(x) is exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) . So the normalised probability for the particle being x0 ≤ x ≤ x0 + dx, p(x)dx, is p(x) dx = exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) dx ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp (−V0|x| n kbT ) . It is convenient to deﬁne the quantity Zn: Zn = ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) . And the average value for the potential energy is ⟨Vn⟩ = ∫ ∞ −∞ dx V0|x| np(x) = ∫ ∞ −∞ dx V0|x| n exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) dx ∫ ∞ −∞ dx exp ( −V0|x| n kbT ) . We will break the derivation of this quantity into a number of stages. (i) Firstly a general result on Zn. Let us deﬁne β = 1/(kbT ). Then show, using the chain rule, that −∂ ln Zn ∂β = ⟨Vn⟩ . (5.4) (ii) Rewrite the the expression for Zn, by deﬁning a new variable of integration y = (βV0) 1/n x to show Zn = (βV0) −1/n ∫ ∞ −∞ dy e−|y|n . (5.5) (iii) Now use Eq. (5.4) and apply to Eq. (5.5). Hence show that ⟨Vn⟩ = 1 nkbT . What value of n corresponds to the harmonic oscillator? (iv) What is the result for particles in the \"ﬂat Earth\" gravitational potential which we considered in analysing the density proﬁle of the atmosphere? Problem 5.9 A two-level heat engine – magnetic cooling Consider a two-level system where the energy diﬀerence between the levels is 2µH, with E− = −µH and E+ = +µH. The physical setting for this is an atomic (or nuclear) magnetic dipole, µ, which has two quantum states. In the presence of an applied magnetic ﬁeld, Hˆz, the states are split to give E±. I.e. the magnetic moment is either parallel or anti-parallel to the ﬁeld. 5 KINETIC THEORY 4 The average magnetisation, M (T, H), is deﬁned as M (T, H) = µp(E−) − µp(E+) . Constructing the probabilities p(E±) using the corresponding Boltzmann factors and hence calculate M (T, H). This plays the role of the equation of state for the two-level system. Work may be performed on the system by changing H. It can be placed in contact with heat baths to exchange heat. Derive the \"internal energy\", U deﬁned via U (T, H) = ⟨E⟩ , where we assume the two-level system is in equilibrium at temperature T . This is a function of state, as in the ideal gas, but note it depends on the applied ﬁeld, H, as well as the temperature. Consider the thermodynamic cycle depicted in Fig. (5.1). Along section 1⃝ the magnetic Figure 5.1: A magnetic refrigeration cycle. ﬁeld is increased adiabatically; there is a heat exchange in section 2⃝ where the two level system cools to come to equilibrium at T3; along section 3⃝ there is an adiabatic decrease in the applied ﬁeld; ﬁnally in section 4⃝ there is a heat exchange with the cold heat bath at T1 and the two level system heats up. (i) Start at (M1, H1). What is the initial temperature, T1? (ii) Increase the magnetic ﬁeld, H, to H2, keeping M ﬁxed. What is the change in the internal energy? (iii) What is the temperature, T2, at this point (M1, H2)? (iv) Then at ﬁxed H = H2 let the system come to equilibrium at the temperature, T3 < T2. Calculate the magnetisation M2, and the change in U . (v) Reduce the ﬁeld adiabatically back to H1. What is the resulting temperature T4? Is it larger or smaller than T1? (vi) Finally exchange heat with the medium at T1. 5 KINETIC THEORY 5 (vii) Is this cycle a refrigeration of heating cycle. Why? (viii) Sketch the isotherms through the vertices of the thermodynamic cycle. Indicate the ordering of the temperatures associated with them. (ix) Show the isotherms for T = 0 and T = ∞ on the diagram. Problem 5.10 Self-diﬀusion constant for an almost ideal gas We employ the same logic as in section 10 to determine the self diﬀusion constant, D, of an almost ideal gas. We deﬁne the concentration of the atomic species as n(y), then experimentally we ﬁnd the number crossing a plane of area A per unit time, dN dt = −D ∂n ∂y A . By considering planes a distance y ± λ away from that at y, show the net transfer of atoms is −2λA⟨v+ y ⟩ ∂n ∂y . Hence show D = 2λ⟨v+ y ⟩ . For air at s.t.p., one ﬁnds D ∼ 10 −5 m2s −1.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
