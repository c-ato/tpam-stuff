Let’s assume we know (or estimate) 𝑥 , 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑥) We set 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) What is 𝑃𝑦(𝑦)? Introduction to Probability Formally we would need 𝑃𝑦 𝑦 = 𝑑 𝑑𝑦 𝑓−1 𝑦 𝑃𝑥 𝑓−1(𝑦) But we don’t know 𝑃𝑥 Instead we target 𝑦 var(𝑦) Example In an experiment, we want to measure kinetic energy. This is hard so instead we measure the velocity of a mass. Then 𝐸 = 1 2 𝑚𝑣2 𝑣 is a random variable. What is ⟨𝐸⟩ and var(𝐸)? Introduction to Probability Taylor’s Theorem Gives a polynomial expression for 𝑓 𝑥 around the point 𝑥0. What if 𝑥 was a random variable? We might want ⟨𝑓 𝑥 ⟩ and var(𝑓 𝑥 ) Introduction to Probability 𝑓 𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑥0 + 𝑥 − 𝑥0 𝑓′ 𝑥0 + 𝑥 − 𝑥0 2 2! 𝑓′′ 𝑥0 + ⋯ Expectation Value Expand 𝑓(𝑥) Introduction to Probability We assume 𝑥 = 𝜇 and 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑥) = 𝜎2 𝑓 𝑥 ≈ 𝑓 𝜇 + 𝑥 − 𝜇 𝑓′ 𝜇 + 𝑥 − 𝜇 2 2 𝑓′′(𝜇) Take expectation ⟨𝑓 𝑥 ⟩ ≈ ⟨𝑓 𝜇 ⟩ + ⟨ 𝑥 − 𝜇 𝑓′ 𝜇 ⟩ + 𝑥 − 𝜇 2 2 𝑓′′(𝜇) Then 𝑓 𝜇 = 𝑓 𝜇 ; 𝑥 − 𝜇 𝑓′ 𝜇 = 𝑓′ 𝜇 𝑥 − 𝜇 = 0 𝑥 − 𝜇 2 2 𝑓′′(𝜇) = 𝑓′′ 𝜇 2 𝑥 − 𝜇 2 = 𝑓′′ 𝜇 𝜎2 2 Expectation Value So 𝑓 ≈ 𝑓(𝜇) If 𝜎2𝑓′′(𝜇) is “small”. And in the experiment we would estimate 𝜇 using the sample mean. Introduction to Probability Variance Propagation From before: 𝑓 ≈ 𝑓(𝜇) Introduction to Probability Then 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝑓 = 𝑓2 − 𝑓 2 = 𝑓2 − 𝑓 𝜇 2 To first order 𝑓 𝑥 ≈ 𝑓 𝜇 + 𝑥 − 𝜇 𝑓′ 𝜇 So 𝑓2 = 𝑓 𝜇 + 𝑥 − 𝜇 𝑓′ 𝜇 2 = 𝑓 𝜇 2 𝑓 𝜇 2 + 2𝑓 𝜇 𝑓′ 𝜇 𝑥 − 𝜇 0 + 𝑓′ 𝜇 2 𝑥 − 𝜇 2 𝜎2 Therefore 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝑓 ≈ 𝑓 𝜇 2 + 𝑓′ 𝜇 2𝜎2 𝑓2 − 𝑓 𝜇 2 𝑓 2 = 𝑓′ 𝜇 2𝜎2 Summary Introduction to Probability 𝑥 ∼ 𝑃𝑥 𝑥 𝑥 = 𝜇 var(𝑥) = 𝜎2 𝑦 ≈ 𝑓(𝜇) var(𝑦) = 𝑓′ 𝜇 2𝜎2 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) If 𝜎2𝑓′′(𝜇) is “small”. Example Measure energy with 𝑣 𝐸 = 1 2 𝑚𝑣2 With 𝑣 = 𝑣0 and var 𝑣 = 𝜎2. Estimate 𝐸 and var(𝐸) Introduction to Probability We use 𝑓 = 𝑓 𝑥 So 𝐸 = 1 2 𝑚𝑣0 2 Then 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝐸 = 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝑣 𝑑𝐸 𝑑𝑣 2 𝑑𝐸 𝑑𝑣 ቚ 𝑣0 2 = 𝑚𝑣0 2 Therefore 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝐸 ≈ 𝜎2𝑚2𝑣0 2 Example If 𝑥 is drawn according to a Poisson distribution with parameter 𝜆, estimate 1 1 + 𝑥 And var 1 1 + 𝑥 n.b. 𝑑 𝑑𝑥 1 1 + 𝑥 = − 1 2 1 + 𝑥 3/2 Remember for a Poisson: 𝑥 = var 𝑥 = 𝜆 Introduction to Probability We want 1 1 + 𝑥 = ෍ 𝑥=0 ∞ 1 1 + 𝑥 𝜆𝑥 𝑥! 𝑒−𝜆 = ? Instead we use 1 1 + 𝑥 ≈ 1 1 + ⟨𝑥⟩ = 1 1 + 𝜆 And var 1 1 + 𝑥 ≈ 𝑑 𝑑𝑥 1 1 + 𝑥 2 ቚ 𝑥=⟨𝑥⟩ 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑥) → var 1 1 + 𝑥 ≈ 1 4 1 + 𝜆 3 𝑑𝑓 𝑑𝑥 2 ณ𝜆 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑥) General formulae If we have 𝑁 variables, 𝑥1, 𝑥2 … 𝑥𝑁 with ⟨𝑥𝑖⟩ = 𝜇𝑖 var 𝑥𝑖 = 𝜎𝑖 2 And the 𝑥’s are statistically independent. For some function 𝑓(𝑥1, 𝑥2 … 𝑥𝑁): 𝑓 ≈ 𝑓(𝜇1, 𝜇2 … 𝜇𝑁) var 𝑓 ≈ 𝜕𝑓 𝜕𝑥1 2 𝜎1 2 + 𝜕𝑓 𝜕𝑥2 2 𝜎2 2 + ⋯ And you would estimate 𝜇𝑖 and 𝜎𝑖 2 using sample values. Introduction to Probability Example Measure energy with 𝑣 and 𝑚 𝐸 = 1 2 𝑚𝑣2 With 𝑣 = 𝑣0 and var 𝑣 = 𝜎𝑣 2 With 𝑚 = 𝑚0 and var 𝑚 = 𝜎𝑚 2 Estimate 𝐸 and var(𝐸) Introduction to Probability For ⟨𝐸⟩ we can just use 𝑚 and ⟨𝑣⟩ so 𝐸 = 1 2 𝑚0𝑣0 2 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝐸 ≈ 𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑣 ቚ𝑣0,𝑚0 2 𝜎𝑣 2 + 𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑚 ቚ 𝑣0,𝑚0 2 𝜎𝑚 2 𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑣 = 𝑚𝑣; 𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑚 = 𝑣2 2 → 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝐸 = 𝑚0 2𝑣0 2𝜎𝑣 2 + 1 4 𝑣0 4𝜎𝑚 2 Class Example Measure speed of sound through liquid 𝑐 = 𝑑 𝑡 By measuring time of flight. 𝑡 = 𝑡0 and var 𝑡 = 𝜎2 Estimate 𝑐 and var(𝑐) var 𝑓 ≈ 𝑑𝑓 𝑑𝑥 2 𝜎2 Introduction to Probability 𝑐 = 𝑑 𝑡0 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐) = 𝑑𝑐 𝑑𝑡 ቚ 𝑡0 2 𝜎2 = − 𝑑 𝑡0 2 2 𝜎2 = 𝑑2𝜎2 𝑡0 4 Class Example (2) Introduction to Probability Measure speed of sound through liquid 𝑐 = 𝑑 𝑡 By measuring time of flight. 𝑡 = 𝑡0 and var 𝑡 = 𝜎𝑡 2 𝑑 = 𝑑0 and var 𝑡 = 𝜎𝑑 2 Estimate 𝑐 and var(𝑐) var 𝑓 ≈ 𝜕𝑓 𝜕𝑥 2 𝜎𝑥 2 + 𝜕𝑓 𝜕𝑦 2 𝜎𝑦 2 𝑐 = 𝑑0 𝑡0 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝑐 = 𝜕𝑐 𝜕𝑡 ቚ 𝑑0,𝑡0 2 𝜎𝑡 2 + 𝜕𝑐 𝜕𝑑 ቚ 𝑑0,𝑡0 2 𝜎𝑑 2 = − 𝑑0 𝑡0 2 2 𝜎𝑡 2 + 1 𝑡0 2 𝜎𝑑 2 = 𝑑0 2𝜎2 𝑡0 4 + 𝜎𝑑 2 𝑡0 2 Simulation Introduction to Probability Time Velocity 𝑑 = 1 𝑡 = 10 and var 𝑡 = 1 𝑐 = 1 10 var 𝑐 = 𝑑2var 𝑡 2 𝑡4 = 1 10000 Summary If we have 𝑁 variables, 𝑥1, 𝑥2 … 𝑥𝑁 with ⟨𝑥𝑖⟩ = 𝜇𝑖 var 𝑥𝑖 = 𝜎𝑖 2 And the 𝑥’s are statistically independent. For some function 𝑓(𝑥1, 𝑥2 … 𝑥𝑁): 𝑓 ≈ 𝑓(𝜇1, 𝜇2 … 𝜇𝑁) var 𝑓 ≈ 𝜕𝑓 𝜕𝑥1 2 𝜎1 2 + 𝜕𝑓 𝜕𝑥2 2 𝜎2 2 + ⋯ And you would estimate 𝜇𝑖 and 𝜎𝑖 2 using sample values.
