In this question we assume we are in a standard two-dimensional (x, y) Cartesian coordinate system with corresponding unit vectors (i, j).) (a) A particle of mass m has a position vector given by r(t) = (2t 4 + 6)i + sin(2t)j. Determine the acceleration of the particle, and hence determine the force acting on the particle. [5] (b) A particle of mass m moves in a force-ﬁeld F = m((y3 − 4)i − j). If the particle starts from rest at the origin, determine the path of the particle as a function of time. [5] 2. A baseball is dropped from rest over the edge of a tall cliﬀ and is subject to quadratic air resistance. What is the terminal fall speed vter of the baseball? The same baseball is thrown vertically upwards from y = 0 with initial speed vo and is again subject to quadratic air resistance. Write down an equation for the upward motion of the ball and show that the maximum rise height is given by ymax = v2 ter 2g ln ( v2 ter + v2 o v2 ter ) . (Note that if dy dt = v then d2y dt2 = v dv dy .) [10] W7120 Turn over - 3 - Speciﬁed Calculator SECTION B 3. A particle of mass m is attached to a spring with a Hooke’s constant of k. Suppose that the particle is on a horizontal frictionless surface and x measures the distance of the particle away from the equilibrium length of the spring. (a) Use Hooke’s law to determine the force acting on the particle due to the spring. [2] (b) Write down Newton’s second law for the particle and hence determine the location of the particle as a function of time, if at time t = 0, x = xo and dx dt = 0. [5] (c) Show that the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy for the particle described in (b) is constant. [5] (d) If we now assume that the particle is subject to a frictional resistance force equal to −b dx dt , determine the location of the particle as a function of time, where once again at time t = 0, x = xo and dx dt = 0. The constants k and b are related by k = 3b2 16m . In this case, what is lim t→∞ x? [8] W7120 Turn over - 4 - Speciﬁed Calculator 4. In polar coordinates Newton’s second law for a particle of mass m can be written as F = Frer + Fθeθ = m ([ d2r dt2 − r ( dθ dt )2] er + [ 2 dr dt dθ dt + r d2θ dt2 ] eθ ) . Assume that the particle is subject to a central force with Fr = −g(r) (for some function g) and Fθ = 0. (a) Show that the quantity h = r2 dθ dt is constant and hence or otherwise show that the position vector of the particle sweeps out equal areas about the origin in equal times. [6] (b) If u = 1/r show that the radial component of Newton’s second law becomes d2u dθ2 + u = g (1/u) mh2u2 , where h is the constant identiﬁed above. [6] (c) Determine the general form of the orbit r(θ) of the particle if g(r) = γ/r2 where γ is a dimensional constant. [6] (d) Under what condition are the orbits calculated above bounded?
