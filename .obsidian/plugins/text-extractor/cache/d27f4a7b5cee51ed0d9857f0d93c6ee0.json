We need two new dynamical variables and the natural choice is p = dx and at least one of the roots is positive and so the origin is unstable. Using x = 1 + δx we have −x + x3 = x(x − 1)(x + 1) ↦→ 1(δx)2 = 2δx and so using the exponential ansatz d2δx Answer 6. We may use Newton’s laws m d2x The separatrix forms an “inﬁnity sign”, surrounding the two sets of distorted ellipses and being surrounded in turn by closed loops. The ellipses are harmonic motion in either of the two minima while the large closed loops describe motion which passes across both minima. At large time we are either oscillating in one of the two minima or across both of the two minima. 7. A one-dimensional particle moves in a potential V (x) = − 1 = ± tanh ( 1Answer 8. The physical picture is mg kr x z and applying Newton’s laws we get, along the x-axis m d2x These equations of motion give us that the energy of each component is separately conserved Ex = m and turns the exact solution into x = A cos [ k + K Alternatively we can target the kinetic and potential energies T = m The equilibrium position is when A=0 and B=0, which gives x= k2dto provide r2 = (a cos θ)2 + (d − a sin θ)2 = d2 + a2 − 2ad sin θ We may now rewrite the potential energy as V = −mga cos θ + 1 or [ dx The y-collisions are analogous under the mapping vx ↔ vy.
