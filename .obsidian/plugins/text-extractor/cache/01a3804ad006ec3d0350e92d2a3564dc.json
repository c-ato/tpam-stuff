Lesne Institut des Hautes ´Etudes Scientiﬁques Le Bois-Marie, 35 route de Chartres, 91440, Bures-sur-Yvette, France. ∗ This chapter confronts renormalization used in quantum ﬁeld theory and that used in critical phenomena studies in statistical mechanics or dy- namical systems theory. Regularization that cures spurious divergences is distinguished from renormalization transformations allowing to com- pute actual physical divergences. The former generates a group, and is also encountered in singular perturbation analyses in nonlinear physics. The latter generates a semi-group, and is implemented as a ﬂow in a space of models; its analysis, focusing on ﬁxed points and their neigh- borhood, allows to determine asymptotic scaling behavior, to delineate universality classes and to assess model structural stability (or instabil- ity, i.e. crossovers). The renormalization group can be seen as a sym- metry group and a general covariant formulation is proposed. Aspects presented here show that renormalization theory has emulated a shift of focus from the investigation of outcomes of a given model to the analysis of models themselves, by relating models of the same system at diﬀerent scales or grouping models of diﬀerent systems exhibiting the same large- scale behavior. So doing, not only (subjective and partial) models are distinguished from underlying physical systems, but also intrinsic phys- ical features can be derived from model comparison and classiﬁcation. 1.1. Introduction A ﬁrst motivation of the present chapter is to investigate the relations be- tween renormalization techniques encountered in very diﬀerent domains of theoretical physics. The use of one and the same term of “renormaliza- tion” seems confusing when comparing its contents in quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) with renormalization methods exploited for studying critical phe- ∗Permanent address: Laboratoire de Physique Th´eorique de la Mati`ere Condens´ee, Uni- versit´e Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, 4 place Jussieu, 75252 Paris Cedex 05, France. 1 June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 2 A. Lesne nomena in statistical mechanics or the onset of chaos in dynamical systems theory. They respectively involve cutoﬀs or local averages, without or with rescaling, a single transformation or a transformation iterated to inﬁnity with relevant large-scale information lying in the limiting behavior of the ensuing ﬂow in a space of modelsa. The approach is perturbative in QFT whereas it is non perturbative in statistical mechanics and dynamical sys- tems theory. The associated ‘renormalization group’ (RG) has a diﬀerent structure, being respectively a group (in general non commutative) or a semi-group (in general commutative). Finally, the divergences asking for renormalization diﬀer in nature, being in short either spurious ultra-violet (UV) divergences of the theory (to be cured) or actual infra-red (IR) diver- gences observed experimentally (to be computed); they come respectively from unphysical features of the theory at very small scales or from the pres- ence of ﬂuctuations and correlations at all scales that build up an anomalous macroscopic behavior. I here propose to distinguish: — renormalization understood in the sense of regularization, used mainly in quantum ﬁeld theory to cure UV divergences, — renormalization implemented as a renormalization ﬂow, used to investi- gate critical phenomena and universal scaling properties. But there are also conceptual and historical links between the diﬀerent renormalization approaches, e.g. they all rely on the computation of eﬀec- tive (‘renormalized’) parameters and exhibit a group structure related to some scale invariance property. The relation between QFT and critical phe- nomena and their respective renormalizations has been already discussed by K.G. Wilson, 51 after he had successfully applied renormalization to un- derstand Kondo eﬀect (eﬀect of a magnetic impurity in a non magnetic metal). I shall discuss in this paper several additional points: – the distinction between regularization and renormalization ﬂow (§ 1.2); – QFT-inspired renormalization to manage with singular perturbations and singular dependence in initial or boundary conditions (§ 1.3); – principles of real-space RG generating a ﬂow in a space of models (§ 1.4); – RG ﬂow seen as a ‘generalized dynamical system’ where the rescaling factor (or number of iterations) plays the role of time; its analysis around renormalization ﬁxed points allows to compute the critical exponents. Re- markably, its global analysis achieves a partition of the space of models into universality classes, identiﬁes the possible origins of crossovers, and provides a systematic way for investigating model structural stability (§ 1.5); aNote that one speaks of a ‘theory’ in QFT and of a ‘model’ in statistical mechanics.

Renormalization as a way of regularization 1.2.1. Historical background The ﬁrst meaning of renormalization, encountered in hydrodynamics more than a century ago, refers to a method in which some indirect, external or spurious eﬀects are dealt with through a redeﬁnition of the parameters of the model. This idea originates in the renormalization of the mass of a moving body into a moving ﬂuid. 9,17 The adjective “renormalized” here describes a coeﬃcient or a quantity computed by adding to its actual value (‘bare’ value) in the initial model M of the systemb S some contributions of the same dimension, coming from additional phenomena taking place in S or from interactions between S and its environment. A typical instance where this basic renormalization is fruitful is the case where some parameters of the initial theoretical model have no experimen- tal reality: their values are aﬀected by the inadequacies of the model (e.g. they diverge) due to an unavoidable lack of information on small scale mech- anisms, and they should be replaced by eﬀective ones in order to reproduce correctly the observed reality: the measured values correspond to these ef- fective parameters. An acknowledged example is the renormalization of the mass of the classical electron. In classical electrodynamics, the electromag- netic mass m∞ is deﬁned by m∞c 2 = U where U is the total electromagnetic energy of the electron; m∞ diverges in the limit where the electron is de- scribed as a point-like charge c. Renormalization here appears as a formal bWe here meet a leitmotiv of the present chapter, that renormalization methods under- lined and exploited in a deep way: the careful distinction between the system S and its models, observer-dependent insofar as constructing a model M requires to choose a theoretical framework, hence to introduce minimum scales under which another theory has to be used.1 cAn intuitive understanding of the problem can be grasped by considering the model where the charge Q is described as a homogeneous distribution in a sphere of radius a, hence involving a uniform charge density ρa(⃗r) = ρa if r < a else 0, such that Q = 4πρaa3/3. Letting the scale a → 0 corresponds to a mathematical idealization extending artiﬁcially the model beyond its natural range of validity, from which the divergence of ρa as a → 0 originates. The mathematical theory of ‘generalized functions’ has been precisely devised by L. Schwartz and others to handle such singular situations: the charge density is properly written as a distribution ρa→0(⃗r) = Qδ(⃗r). What makes June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 4 A. Lesne operation aiming at reestablishing the operational validity of the point-like model. It consists in compensating the divergence of m∞ by an inﬁnite mass m′ in order to obtain an eﬀective ﬁnite mass mef f = m∞ − m′, giving the experimental value of the mass. mef f can rather be termed a regular- ized quantity in which the spurious divergence due to the model inadequacy at inﬁnitely small scales has been discarded. 1.2.2. Ultra-violet divergences and cutoﬀs In QFT, renormalization mainly refers to a procedure intending to eliminate the so-called “UV divergences” arising in perturbative calculations with re- spect to interaction terms (the zero order being the free-ﬁeld theory). The adjective “ultra-violet” refers to high-energy and large-momentum domain in the conjugate space, corresponding to structures and mechanisms with short characteristic lengths and times. As in the above examples, § 1.2.1, the origin of UV divergences is the inadequacy of the explicit microscopic description that encompasses an unlimited number of interactions of ar- bitrarily small scale and high energy (e.g. arbitrarily fast creation and annihilation of electron-positon pairs d). The occurrence of ultra-violet di- vergences thus appears as a feature of the theory. Regularization intends to compensate the unphysical inﬁnite contributions in perturbative expansions by adequately modifying the initial model, so as to obtain ﬁnite contribu- tions and, all things considered, a regular model. A standard way to implement regularization is to introduce an UV cut- oﬀ Λ = (Λq, Λω) and to ignore large-momentum and large-frequency com- ponents with q ≡ ||⃗q|| > Λq and |ω| > Λω (those producing unphysical divergences). Mechanisms involving these components, i.e. high energy processes, are no longer described explicitly but taken into account by in- troducing additional low-momentum and low-frequency contributions. By construction, the eﬀective model thus obtained has only components with q ≤ Λq and |ω| ≤ Λω (hence no longer UV divergences) and it induces the same observable consequences as the initial model; this is the very prescrip- tion deﬁning what the additional terms should be, the obvious diﬃculty being to explicitly determine the terms that fulﬁll this requirement. sense physically is not the inﬁnite value of ρa→0 at the point-charge location ⃗r = 0 but the integrated distribution over an observation sphere of radius r0 since R r<r0 ρa→0(⃗r)d⃗r = Q (independently of r0, that plays the role of a cutoﬀ, as in § 1.2.2). dA similar diﬃculty would arise in chemistry, associated with the lack of knowledge about elementary reactions, involving transient species of arbitrarily short lifetimes. June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 5 UV cutoﬀs are here used to circumvent ill-deﬁned small-scale mecha- nisms and stick to a well-controlled eﬀective theory; we shall see in § 1.3.2 that they are also useful to reduce the number of microscopic degrees of freedom (replaced by a smaller number of eﬀective degrees of freedom) and are centrally involved in renormalization-group studies in statistical physics. 1.2.3. Renormalizability In quantum electrodynamics, a theory is said to be renormalizable if its regularization, that is, adding eﬀective terms to counterbalance apparent divergences due to the inadequacy of the theory at high energies, amounts to a modiﬁcation of the coupling constants (charges) and masses into “renor- malized” ones.6 When regularization is implemented with an UV cutoﬀ, renormalizability means that the overall inﬂuence of the modes left aside by the cutoﬀ can be reproduced by changing the parameters which control the equations for the remaining modes. Renormalizability appears as a kind of internal consistency of the theory, as its space-time scales can be bounded from below without increasing the dimension of the parameter space. It is still discussed whether renormalizability has to be prescribed as a criterion of validity when constructing a quantum ﬁeld theory. 1.2.4. Emergence of the notion of renormalization group The so-called renormalization group has been introduced in 1953 by Stueck- elberg and Petermann 49 to relate one to another the diﬀerent regular- ized models MΛ obtained with diﬀerent UV cutoﬀs Λ. One may indeed introduce a transformation RΛ2,Λ1 relating the regularized models MΛ1 and MΛ2 according to MΛ2 = RΛ2,Λ1[MΛ1 ]. In other words, the vari- ous possible regularizations [RΛ,∞]Λ>0, each associated with a cutoﬀ pa- rameter Λ, are formally related through RΛ2,∞ = RΛ2,Λ1 ◦ RΛ1,∞. Ob- vious transitivity (the models are regularized versions of the same the- ory) implies that the set of operators R has a group-theoretic structure RΛ3,Λ2 ◦RΛ2,Λ1 = RΛ3,Λ1 which explains the term “renormalization group”. In case when the transformation RΛ2,Λ1 depends only on the ratio e Λ1/Λ2, namely RΛ2,Λ1 = ̃RΛ1/Λ2, the constructive relation ̃Rk[MΛ] = MΛ/k implies the simpler group-theoretic relation ̃Rk1 ◦ ̃Rk2 = ̃Rk1k2. Soon after, a similar method was exploited by Gell-Mann and Low28 to eFor simplicity, we here use a shortcut in the notation: being a bound on 4-vectors, Λ hence k have 4 components, and the ratio Λ1/Λ2 should be considered component-wise. June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 6 A. Lesne study the behavior of quantum electrodynamics at small space-time scales. They ﬁrst pointed out the relevance of using diﬀerent eﬀective parameters according to the scale κ of the description, which led them to introduce apparent charges (eκ)κ for the electron. Again, the breakthrough was to relate one to another the diﬀerent values (eκ)κ, more precisely their square EQ = (eκ=√Q) 2, by a renormalization transformation: Rk,Q[EQ] = EQ/k (1.1) A non-commutative group-like structure shows up in the relation Rk2,Q/k1 ◦ Rk1,Q = Rk1k2,Q (1.2) Commutativity fails as Rk2,Q/k1◦ Rk1,Q = Rk1,Q/k2◦ Rk2,Q ̸= Rk1,Q ◦Rk2,Q/k1 (in fact, the right-hand-side is not deﬁned, and the structure is not a group but a groupoid in which the internal composition law is not total). Such a renormalization group is said to be non-autonomous because the asso- ciated renormalization equation, obtained by diﬀerentiating the relation Rk,Q[EQ] = EQ/k with respect to k and taking k = 1, appears to be a non-autonomous dynamical system: Q ( dEQ dQ ) (Q) = − ( dRk,Q dk ) (k=1) [EQ] ≡ ψ (EQ, m2 Q ) (1.3) where m is the mass of the electron, or equivalently: κ2 de 2 κ dκ2 = ψ (e 2 κ, m2 κ2 ) (1.4) (note that the right-hand-side depends explicitly on κ). The diﬃcult step is to compute the function ψ from the quantum electrodynamic description of the electron. ψ contains the information required to determine the cor- respondence κ ↦→ eκ. The limiting case e∞ corresponds to the bare charge that appears in the initial theory; it does not correspond to a physical (i.e. measurable) quantity because the electron cannot be removed from the electromagnetic ﬁeld and its charge measured in a bare situation. By contrast, any renormalized charge eκ is a physical quantity corresponding to the charge measured at a κ-dependent energy level. 1.2.5. Renormalization equations Scale consistency of the regularization expresses in the renormalization group-structure (1.2) or equivalently in its diﬀerential form (1.3-1.4) called June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 7 a renormalization equation. It ensures basically that the arbitrary cut- oﬀ choice has no impact on the investigated physical features and in fact contains all the information to determine them. A change of notation Rk,Q[EQ] ≡ ¯g(k, Q, EQ) translates the group relation (1.2) into the equa- tions derived by Bogoliubov and Shirkov: 3 ¯g(x, y, g) = ¯g[x/k, y/k, ¯g(k, y, g)] (1.5) expressing the functional self-similarity of the regularization. Derivation with respect to k in k = 1 yields the so-called Callan-Symanzik equations: 46 [ x ∂ ∂x + y ∂ ∂y − β(y, g) ∂ ∂g ] ¯g(x, y, g) = 0 (1.6) where β(y, g) = ∂¯g ∂x (x = 1, y, g) (1.7) These ﬁrst advances, now ﬁfty years old, have been followed by a huge amount of developments, giving rise to new issues and new viewpoints on renormalization, for which I refer, among others, to papers by Rivasseau, 44 Ebrahimi-Fard and Kreimer 20 or Connes, 14 and a book of proceedings edited by Duplantier and Rivasseau. 18 1.3. Renormalization to compute singular limits 1.3.1. Renormalization to handle non-commuting limits A common feature of all renormalization techniques is to deal with singular limits. In QFT, an ill-deﬁned small-scale limit lima→0 m∞(a) = ∞ is regu- larized, currently using a cutoﬀ Λ, so that mΛ(a) remains ﬁnite (and inde- pendent of the scale a) as a → 0; one would like here to compute limΛ→0 mΛ. In statistical physics, the issue is to compute the temperature dependence of a thermodynamic limit f (size N → ∞ at constant density) and its critical behavior limT →Tc limN →∞ (diﬀering from limN →∞ limT →Tc ). In dynam- ical systems theory, similar non commuting limits arise in computing the parameter µ dependence of the asymptotic behavior (inﬁnite time) and its bifurcating behavior limµ→µc limt→∞. The idea of renormalization is to evidence an invariant behavior when the limits are performed jointly, the parameter being gradually renormal- ized as 1/Λ, N or t goes to inﬁnity. The unique way to get a non trivial fIndeed, Lee-Yang theorem assessed that phase transitions are well-deﬁned only in the thermodynamic limit (as free energy singularities) and have no rigorous meaning in a ﬁnite system.36,54 June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 8 A. Lesne limiting behavior expresses through renormalization equation and the point is that it contains all the desired information on the investigated behavior. 1.3.2. Renormalization approach to singular perturbations Singular perturbations refer to situations depending on a small dimension- less parameter ϵ in such a way that the behavior for ϵ = 0 diﬀers qual- itatively from the limiting behavior ϵ → 0. Acknowledged examples are anharmonic oscillators (Duﬃng and Van der Pol oscillators) where the damping goes to 0 with ϵ, hydrodynamics in the inviscid limit (viscosity ν ∼ ϵ → 0), diﬀerential equations where ϵ is a factor in front of the highest- order derivative, or secular divergences (originally in celestial mechanics) where a resonance between the perturbation and the unperturbed system builds up a slow unbounded drift (we here face again non commuting limits limϵ→0 limt→∞ ̸= limt→∞ limϵ→0). As in critical phenomena, divergences arise at large scales and correspond to a real feature; but perturbation series asking for regularization are quite similar to QFT divergences issues. Let us denote θ a control parameter and investigate the θ-dependence of the asymptotic behavior of the solution f (ϵ, θ, t) of an ϵ-dependent dy- namical system. The singularity reﬂects in the lack of uniform convergence of the straightforward perturbation series: f (ϵ, θ, t) = ∞∑ n=0 ϵ nfn(θ, t) (1.8) for instance limt→∞ fn(θ, t) = ∞ at ﬁxed n and θ. It means that the perturbation, although of small amplitude and controlled over any ﬁnite time, is ampliﬁed and propagated up to have macroscopic non perturbative consequences, that makes the ϵ-expansion inconsistent at long times: the relative order of the successive terms is not preserved along the time. It is thus impossible to investigate the asymptotic behavior t → ∞ using the plain expansion (1.8). The principle of the renormalization approach is to integrate diverging contributions in a reparametrization: f (ϵ, θ, t) = g[ϵ, Θ(ϵ, θ, t), t] (1.9) where the renormalized parameter Θ(ϵ, θ, t) is such that the expansion of g(ϵ, Θ, t) in powers of ϵ is uniformly convergent with respect to Θ and t. This prescription requires a solubility condition, expressing the multi-scale consistency of the renormalized perturbation expansion, to be satisﬁed: the fast components should actually be fast, meaning that they have no slowly June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 9 evolving consequences, and slow modes should involve slow variables only. In this way, the asymptotic behavior can be faithfully captured at ﬁnite or- ders of the ϵ-expansion of g(ϵ, Θ, t). 10 The solubility condition appears as a renormalization equation, thus bridging this approach with QFT renormal- ization (§ 1.2.5). Other common features with QFT regularization are that a single step θ → Θ will be in general suﬃcient, no rescaling is involved, and the procedure is not intended to be iterated to inﬁnity. 1.3.3. Singular dependence to initial conditions A formal identity can be drawn between the QFT renormalization equa- tions, § 1.2.5, and the regularization of the solution f (t; t0, f0) of a diﬀeren- tial equation that depends in a singular way on the initial condition (f0, t0) with f (t0; t0, f0) = f0. Namely, f0 tends to ∞ as one tries to let t0 → −∞: some cutoﬀ or regularization is thus required, as in QFT. Let us note z = e t, z0 = e t0 and f (t; t0, f0) = F (z; z0, f0). The group structure of the solution (a temporal ﬂow) implies that F (z; z0, f0) = F [z; z1, F (z1; z0, f0)] (1.10) When F (z; z0, f0) = g(z/z0, f0), it comes g(x, f0) = g[x/k, g(k, f0)] to be compared to the homogeneous (y-independent) version of (1.6). The same functional self-similarity is observed, expressing here the consistency rela- tion between the initial conditions at diﬀerent times required to describe one and the same solution. It will be exploited to replace the singular initial condition in z0 = 0 by a ﬁnite one at some z1 > 0. This intermediary z1 plays the role of a cutoﬀ and its speciﬁc value is of no importance provided the corresponding initial condition is chosen according to (1.10), namely1 = F (z1; z0, f0). This procedure for regularizing a singular dependence to initial condition has been successfully applied to anomalous diﬀusion equation 29 and several other partial diﬀerential equations. 11,30 Let us un- derline that renormalization is here applied only once, and to the solution itself; it thus strongly diﬀers from the RG procedure applied to the evolu- tion rules that will be discussed in the next section, § 1.4.2. 1.4. Renormalization of critical phenomena 1.4.1. From QFT to critical phenomena In the context of critical phenomena, RG approaches have been developed to compute large-scale behaviors, singular insofar as scaling exponents com- June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 10 A. Lesne puted by mean-ﬁeld methods dramatically diﬀer from the measured ones; one also speaks of anomalous exponents. The discrepancy clearly originates in the very notion of criticality: the system exhibits long-range correlations; accordingly, the slightest ﬂuctuations are able to have a macroscopic impact and never self-average out. 29,37 Denoting ξ the correlation length and a a typical molecular length scale, all the ﬂuctuations in the range [a, ξ] matter (with ξ → ∞ at the critical point whereas ξ is of the same order than a far away from the critical point). Experimental signatures are the divergences at the critical temperature Tc of susceptibilities, transport coeﬃcients and other response functions, and singularities at T = Tc of thermodynamic functions, e.g. free energy or order parameter; in the critical region where ξ(t) ≫ a, all these quantities satisfy scaling laws with respect to T − Tc with anomalous exponents. 38 The conceptual unity of RG across diﬀerent domains of theoretical physics has already been underlined, by bridging RG principles and tech- niques between QFT and statistical physics 25,52,55 but also between statisti- cal physics and dynamical systems (analogy between spatial and temporal settings) 29,37 and even probability theory, understanding criticality as a statistical pathology departing from the central limit theorem range of va- lidity. 10,34 Focusing here on the passage from QFT to statistical physics, several common features can be underlined, mainly UV cutoﬀs and the computation of eﬀective parameters. But there are also deep diﬀerences, already mentioned in the introduction, § 1.1, that we shall now detail; they are mainly related to the systematic exploitation of the renormalization (semi)group-structure insofar as it generates a ﬂow in the space of models. 1.4.2. Principles of renormalization-group analysis The issue in critical phenomena studies is to account for the macroscopic impact of ﬂuctuations at all scales. Renormalization proceeds by dividing the correlation range into subranges that can be recursively managed with by means of coarse-graining g, that is, by integrating out the smallest-scale degrees of freedom and interactions, and capturing their overall inﬂuence gIn one case, namely fully developed turbulence driven by an energy input at a macro- scopic scale, the relevant renormalization scheme is to integrate out the inﬂuence of large scale onto smaller ones, traveling the Richardson cascade downwards, down to dissipa- tion scale; indeed, criticality here appears when the dissipation scale tends to 0, since then small-scale singularities develop in ﬁnite time, whereas the macroscopic scales are prescribed in the setting, e.g. the size of an obstacle or the scale at which energy is injected. This unique situation is known as inverse renormalization-group.27 June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 11 through eﬀective terms at higher scales. When the model is expressed in the conjugate space, a coarse-graining corresponds to a UV cutoﬀ integrat- ing out modes with large wave vectors, as in QFT. However, it is usually assumedh in (classical) statistical physics that the model exhibits a minimal length scale a = 2π/Λq, e.g. the cell size in spin lattice models or more generally some molecular length scale. Contrary to regularizing cutoﬀs in QFT, cutoﬀs involved in statistical physics are ﬁnite ones, in the sense that they integrate out modes in a ﬁnite window Λq/k < q ≤ Λq for some scale factor k > 1. In real space, coarse-graining is implemented through a local average over cells of linear size ka. Considering the coarse-grained cells as the elementary units in the renormalized description reduces the number N of elements by a factor kd where d is the space dimension. Another departure from QFT renormalization is to supplement the coarse-graining (equivalently the cutoﬀ) with rescalings intending to make the renormalized conﬁgurations the most similar possible to the original ones. The lattice cell size a (equivalently the upper bound Λq) is preserved by means of a rescaling of all lengths by the factor k. Other rescalings, in the ﬁrst place of the local state variable ⃗s (e.g. the spin value in case of spin lattice models) might be needed to preserve physical invariants. The central step of renormalization is to describe how the model should change when we change the description level in order to correspond to the same real system. It expresses as a transformation φ → Rkφ of the model rule φ, that is a “microscopic” state function (deﬁned on the microscopic phase space of the model) which thoroughly determines the microscopic behavior: think of a reduced Hamiltonian φ = H/kBT where T is the temperature and kB the Boltzmann constant; other examples of model rules are the action in a quantum ﬁeld theory, the evolution map for a discrete dynamical system, the vector-ﬁeld for a continuous dynamical system, or the transition probabilities for a diﬀusion process. In summary (details and case studies can be found in literature 8,10,22,23,29,37,52) the renormalization procedure acts jointly on several quantities: N → N k−d which deﬁnes the rescaling factor k, ⃗r → ⃗r/k in the real space, ⃗q → k⃗q in the conjugate space, ⃗s → ⃗s/kw (suitable rescaling to preserve physical invariants), φ → Rkφ (renormalization operator) with Rk1 ◦ Rk2 = Rk1k2. hWe mean that investigations start directly with a lattice or ﬁnite-resolution model, without working out its derivation from more fundamental (e.g. quantum) physics. June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 12 A. Lesne It makes sense to compare the initial model with the renormalized one since they have the same (apparent) resolution. A single renormalization is already fruitful since it achieves dimensional reduction, as well as regular- ization insofar as the correlation length ξ is reduced due to space rescaling: ξ(Rkφ) = ξ(φ)/k hence the model is less critical. But renormalization be- comes really fruitful when iterated. A renormalized model of size N (e.g. with N elements) corresponds to an original model of size N0 = kdN : the larger the original system, the more times its model at a given scale a could be renormalized. At ﬁxed N , limk→∞(Rkφ)(N ) describes the thermody- namic limit of the model ruled by φ. This idea of iterated coarse-grainings has been proposed by Kadanoﬀ, 35 and it amounts to consider the degrees of freedom not all at once but hierarchically and recursively. In case of critical phenomena, renormalization should be iterated indeﬁnitely to take into account ﬂuctuations and correlations at all scales. As can be guessed from the equivalence between coarse-grainings and cutoﬀs, renormalization can be implemented either in real space or in conju- gate space. Real-space RG7 is intuitively meaningful hence easier to devise; it is preferable for systems where real-space geometry plays a central role, e.g. for percolation and polymer conformation studies. 16 RG implemented in the conjugate space is technically more eﬃcient; in particular, the space dimension d appears as a numerical parameter, that allows to implement a perturbation approach with respect to ϵ = 4 − d (critical exponents take their mean-ﬁeld values for i d > dc = 4), the so-called ϵ-expansion. 53 Renormalization can also be exploited to investigate critical dynamics, replacing coarse-graining in real space by a local time averaging over k time steps, while the ﬂow analysis follows the same steps. RG methods have for instance been very fruitful to investigate universal scaling at the onset of chaos in the period-doubling scenario. 13,15,21,37 Spatio-temporal extension as well has been developed to investigate dynamic critical phenomena. 32 RG can also be seen as an iterated multiscale approach allowing to derive in a rigorous, systematic and constructive way eﬀective low-dimensional equations describing large-scale behavior of the system under consideration; an example is the derivation of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations from Boltzmann kinetic equation. 10,31 iFor d = dc = 4, the critical exponents still take their mean-ﬁeld values but additional logarithmic terms slightly modify the scaling laws.

Renormalization ﬂow around an hyperbolic ﬁxed-point φ∗ in the space of model rules {φ}. The critical manifold coincides with the stable manifold Σs. The critical scaling of a one-parameter family (φK )K is obtained by determining the critical point Kc such that φKc ∈ Σs and identifying the renormalization action on the family with its action along the unstable manifold Σu. A universality class is thus associated with each hyperbolic ﬁxed point. Relevant directions are the unstable ones (along Σu) while contributions to φ along Σs have no large-scale consequences. 1.4.3. RG computation of critical exponents Let us now unravel the ‘magic of the renormalization-group’ 26 leading from general principles to numerical values for the critical exponents. Having devised the renormalization operator Rk, the next step is the determina- tion of its ﬁxed points φ∗ satisfying the ﬁxed-point equation Rkφ∗ = φ∗ and corresponding to exact self-similarity. Since ξ[Rk(φ)] = ξ(φ)/k, the correlation length ξ∗ = ξ(φ∗) satisﬁes ξ∗ = ξ∗/k hence either ξ∗ = 0 (trivial ﬁxed point corresponding to an uncorrelated system) or ξ∗ = ∞, associated with criticality. Critical ﬁxed points are those having moreover both stable and unstable directions (‘hyperbolic’ ﬁxed points). The operators Rk are precisely designed to extract the universal large-scale behavior of a critical system. Each renormalization eliminates the speciﬁc small-scale details in order to highlight the self-similar properties common to all the models of the same universality class: all models converging to the same ﬁxed point φ∗ upon the action of Rk exhibit the same large-scale features: those of φ∗. The stable manifold Σ s of φ∗ is thus the location of the critical systems: ∀ φ ∈ Σ s, lim n→∞ R n k0φ = lim k→∞ Rkφ = φ∗ (1.11) June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 14 A. Lesne To grasp the principle of RG computation of critical exponents, we shall consider a model rule φK depending on a control parameter K, and assume (at the cost of some approximations to be checked afterwards) that renormalization action can be transferred onto a transformation K → rk(K), i.e. RkφK ≈ φrk(K). The critical point is determined by rk(Kc) ≈ Kc, with φKc ∈ Σ s (see Fig. 1.1). Plugging the investigated scaling law ξ(φK) ∼ |K − Kc| −ν for the correlation length into the equa- tion ξ(RkφK) = ξ(φK)/k expressing the renormalization action on ξ yields |rk(K) − Kc| −ν ∼ |K − Kc| −ν/k. Then, the ﬁrst order approximation rk(K) − Kc ≈ rk(K) − rk(Kc) ≈ r′ k(Kc)[K − Kc] yields k = |r′ k(Kc)| ν from which follows the value of the exponent: ν = ln k ln |r′ k(Kc)| (1.12) The next and last step is to show that |r′ k(Kc)| coincides with the largest eigenvalue of DRk(φ∗). Expanding RkφK ≈ φrk(K) around K = Kc yields: DRk(φKc ) . ∂φK ∂K (Kc) . (K − Kc) ≈ ∂φK ∂K (Kc) . r′ k(Kc) . (K − Kc) (1.13) Provided φKc is enough close to φ∗, this equation reduces to: DRk(φ∗) . ∂φK ∂K (Kc) ≈ ∂φK ∂K (Kc) . r′ k(Kc) (1.14) Applying the projection P u onto the unstable direction of DRk(φ∗) to this equation evidences the ‘transversality condition’ P u [ ∂φK ∂K (Kc)] ̸= 0 required for the validity of the analysis and ﬁnally yields the equality r′ k(Kc) = kγ1 where kγ1 is the most unstable eigenvalue of DRk(φ∗). In case when the renormalization operator involves m > 1 rescaling factors (k1, . . . , km), there is in general a unique one-parameter family ¯k = (kα1 , kα2 , . . . , kαm ) leading to a non trivial limit as k → ∞, and this very fact brings a lot of information on the scaling exponents describing the asymptotic behavior. Let us consider the example of diﬀusion processes. Aiming at determining the leading behavior at large scales of a random walk in R d, renormalization procedure is deﬁned by the action on the transition probability p(⃗r, t) (probability density of being in ⃗r at time t when starting from the origin at time t = 0) of a family [Rk,K]k≥1,K≥1 of operators [Rk,K(p)](⃗r, t) ≡ kd p(k⃗r, Kt) (1.15) The mean-square displacement D(p, t) ≡ ⟨(⃗r(t) − ⃗r(0)) 2⟩ is transformed according to k2n D[R n k,Kp, t] = D(p, K nt) after n iterations. In case of nor- mal diﬀusion, only the iteration of Rk,K=k2 leads to a non trivial limit, 10,37 June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 15 yielding the asymptotic diﬀusion law D(p, t) ∼ Dt (for t → ∞) of the pro- cess. Starting with diﬀerent assumptions on the statistics of the elementary steps (e.g. L´evy distributed), the non trivial limit is obtained with K = kα, yielding D(p, t) ∼ |t| 2/α for t → ∞. 1.5. Structural stability and universality classes 1.5.1. Renormalization as a ﬂow in a space of models The above technical steps in fact lead to a huge methodological shift: in- stead of studying the outcome of a given model M, for example computing the value of state functions and their variations with respect to variables and parameters changes, renormalization analysis focuses on the transfor- mation of the model following a change in the description scale and on the renormalization ﬂow it generates. In other words, renormalization deﬁnes a dynamical system in the space of model rules {φ}: either a discrete one if only an isolated map R is deﬁned and iterated, the number of iterations being the analog of (discrete) time; either a continuous one if Rk depends smoothly on a continuous rescaling factor k. In this latter case, denoting κ = ln k and ̃Rκ = Rk, the renormalization group structure is that of a one-parameter ﬂow φ(κ; κ0; φ0) = ̃Rκ−κ0 φ0. In its diﬀerential form, the dynamical system writes dφ dκ (κ) = L[φ(κ)] with L = d ̃Rκ dκ (κ = 0) (1.16) As we shall see, a trajectory represents the relation between models of the same system at diﬀerent scales, whereas comparing diﬀerent trajectories allows to investigate model structural stability and universality classes. 1.5.2. Relevant and irrelevant contributions Due to the renormalization group structure, the eigenvectors (hj)j≥1 of DRk(φ∗) do not depend on k and the eigenvalues have the form kγ, where γ > 0 for the unstable directions and γ < 0 for the stable onesj. A parametrization of the model rules is available in the neighborhood of φ∗: φ = φ∗ + ∞∑ j=1 ϕj hj +O(ϕ2) ⇒ Rkφ = φ∗ + ∞∑ j=1 kγj ϕj hj +O(ϕ2) (1.17) jComplex eigenvalues would generate oscillatory corrections to scaling. June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 16 A. Lesne where the labeling j → ϕj is chosen according to the ordering γj ≥ γj+1. Hence, renormalization reduces in the linear approximation to a scale trans- formation rk acting component-wise according to r(j) k (ϕj) = kγj ϕj. The scaling behavior of any state function A follows. Indeed, denoting kα the rescaling factor for the values of A (e.g. α = 1 if A is a length or α = 2w if A is the correlation function of the local state variable ⃗s), its transforma- tion upon renormalization writes exactly A(N, Rkφ) = k−αA(N kd, φ) and in the linear approximation A[N, (ϕj)j≥1] = kα A[N k−d, (kγj ϕj)j≥1] (1.18) The signs of the exponents (γj)j≥1 are crucial. The direction associated to γj is said to be: relevant if γj > 0, marginal if γj = 0, irrelevant if γj < 0. Let us explain this terminology in case when γ1 > γ2 > γ3 = 0 > γ4. The coeﬃcient ϕ1, associated to the maximal exponent γ1 > 0, appears to be the control parameter of the phenomenon; in particular, critical behavior is observed for ϕ1 → 0. Taking k = ϕ−1/γ1 1 (if ϕ1 > 0) leads to: A(ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, ϕ4) = ϕ−α/γ1 1 A(1, ϕ2 ϕ−γ2/γ1 1 , ϕ3, ϕ4 ϕ−γ4/γ1 1 ) (1.19) The value of ϕ4 does not play any role on the limiting behavior ϕ1 → 0, hence ϕ4 is an irrelevant parameter. Typically, A(1, z, ϕ3, 0) behaves as a power law |z| µ ± for z tending to ±∞, hence the leading behavior when ϕ1 → 0 + writes A(ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, ϕ4) ∼ ϕ−η 1 where: • if ϕ2 = 0, A(ϕ1, 0, ϕ3, ϕ4) ∼ ϕ −α γ1 1 Θ 0(ϕ3) hence η = α γ1 ; • if ϕ2 > 0, A(ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, ϕ4) ∼ ϕ −(α+γ2)µ+ γ1 1 ϕµ + 2 Θ +(ϕ3) hence η = α+γ2µ + γ1 ; • if ϕ2 < 0, A(ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, ϕ4) ∼ ϕ −(α+γ2)µ− γ1 1 |ϕ2| µ − Θ −(ϕ3) hence η = α+γ2µ − γ1 , where Θ0, Θ + and Θ − are regular functions of their arguments. Simi- lar scaling laws are deduced for the various derivatives of A. Hence the relevant directions control the values of critical exponents. A crossover be- tween diﬀerent scaling laws is observed when ϕ2 varies from negative values to positive ones, passing through ϕ2 = 0 (other instances of crossover are investigated in the next subsection). The marginal directions do not af- fect the exponent values but intervene in the prefactors. The irrelevant directions have no inﬂuence at all on the leading scaling behavior; they only provide corrections to the asymptotic scaling behavior. Additional corrections come from the nonlinear terms in the renormalization action. June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 17 Let us illustrate the above discussion with the ferromagnetic transition: we have ϕ1 = Tc − T and ϕ2 = h (magnetic ﬁeld). Taking for A the magnetization m, we have in zero ﬁeld m(T, h = 0) ∼ (Tc − T ) β with β = −α/γ1 (here α < 0 hence β > 0). In non-vanishing magnetic ﬁeld, the behavior of the magnetization with respect to Tc − T is regular: this corresponds to µ ± = −α/γ2, so that m(T = Tc, h) ∼ |h| δ with δ = −α/γ2 (hence δ > 0). Taking now for A the correlation length, with α = 1, we get ξ(T, h = 0) ∼ |T − Tc| −ν with ν = 1/γ1: we recover the expression (1.12), namely ν = ln k/ ln kγ1. 1.5.3. Crossovers A crossover refers to the failure to reach the scaling regime prescribed by the action of R along the most unstable direction of the critical ﬁxed point φ∗. Diﬀerent origins can be distinguished, that will put forward related notions: crossover exponent, crossover scale and crossover parameter. (i) The underlying system is of ﬁnite size L that prevents it to reach the asymptotic universal regime. We then observe ﬁnite-size scaling: a scaling law A(K) ∼ |K − Kc| −α becomes A(L, K) ∼ L βF [L|K − Kc| ν] where ν is the exponent of the correlation length ξ(K) ∼ |K − Kc| −ν. Indeed, ξ(K) is the unique other characteristic length of the system, hence a scaling argument implies that F depends on the unique variable L/ξ(K). The behavior of the scaling function should be F (z) ∼ z−α/ν as z → 0 so as to recover the inﬁnite-size scaling as L → ∞, from which follows β = α/ν. In renormalization terms, the ﬁnite size of the system is directly related to the number of renormalizations that can be performed starting from the initial model, i.e. to the length of the trajectory in the space of model rules. (ii) DR(φ∗) has more than one unstable direction hence more than one relevant control parameter, say K and h (think of a ferromagnetic system where K is related to the temperature and h is the magnetic ﬁeld); we then observe bi-critical scaling. 41 RG arguments that related critical exponents to the unstable eigenvalue of DRk(φ∗) extend to the situation where there is two unstable eigenvalues, as exposed above in § 1.5.2. Bi-critical scaling and ﬁnite-size scaling in fact express through very analogous scaling relations, the role of L being played by 1/h where h = 0 recovers the standard scaling. In the case of a ferromagnet, 29,38 the joint scaling of the magnetization with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld h and the temperature diﬀerence T − Tc write m(h, T ) ∼ |T − Tc| βM (h|T − Tc| ∆) with a ﬁnite value M (0) and June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 18 A. Lesne M (z → ∞) ∼ z−β/∆; in a similar way, the singular part of the free energy writes fsing(h, T ) ∼ |T − Tc| 2−αF (h|T − Tc| ∆) with F (0) ﬁnite and F (z → ∞) ∼ z−(2−α)/∆. For |h|.|T − Tc| ∆ ≪ 1, the leading order describes the behavior with respect to T at h = 0, e.g. fsing(h = 0, T ) ∼ |T − Tc| 2−α. For |h|.|T − Tc| ∆ ≫ 1, what dominates is the behavior with respect to h at T = Tc, namely m(h, Tc) ∼ |h| −β/∆. The exponent ∆ is called the crossover exponent with ∆ = −β/δ so as to recover the scaling law m(h, Tc) ∼ |h| δ. (iii) R has several critical ﬁxed points, say φ∗ 1 and φ∗ 3. In the generic case, φ∗ 2 does not belong to Σ s(φ∗ 1) (see Fig. 1.1) hence the ﬁxed point that inﬂu- ences the trajectory upon the action of R depends on the initial condition φ but also dramatically on the number n of iterations of R. Each ﬁxed point describes a diﬀerent form of collective behavior observed when R nφ comes close to the corresponding ﬁxed point. The number n is directly related to the observation scale, i.e. the system or sample size L according to kna ∼ L if a is the resolution at which the initial model and its rule φ describe the real system. Two scaling behaviors will thus be observed according to the system size, that evidence a crossover scale L ∗ at which occurs a ﬁxed-point dominance exchange (L ∗ ∼ kn ∗a such that R n ∗ φ becomes more sensitive to φ∗ 2 than to φ∗ 1). Detailed understanding of such a crossover requires a global analysis of the renormalization ﬂow. An example is the behavior of the sum (divided by N ) of N independent random variables distributed ac- cording to a truncated L´evy distribution: at moderately large values of N , the dominant behavior is described by the anomalous central limit theorem for L´evy distributions while at very large values of N , the standard central limit theorem applies since the random variables have a ﬁnite variance. 48 We see that such a crossover might be avoided in a system of ﬁnite size L < L ∗ where the ultimate inﬂuence of the second ﬁxed point φ∗ 2 will never been felt. (iv) R has several critical ﬁxed points that have disjoint basins of attrac- tion; in this case, the crossover is sharper than in (iii) and the initial location φ in the space of models fully determines to which critical ﬁxed point the trajectory R nφ converges upon the renormalization action, i.e. which one determines its universality class and critical exponents. Such a crossover is observed if the rule depends on a parameter ϵ (the crossover parameter) determining to which basin of attraction it belongs: the system belongs to diﬀerent universality classes for diﬀerent values of ϵ. An example has been June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 19 proposed by Fisher, 22 considering a spin lattice with a pair Hamiltonian H(⃗s, ⃗s ′) = K(s1s ′ 1 + s2s ′ 2 + s3s ′ 3) + ϵK(s2s ′ 2 + s3s ′ 3) (1.20) where ⃗s = (s1, s2, s3). For ϵ = 0, critical exponents are those of Heisenberg spins with 3 components; for ϵ = −1, those of Ising spins with 1 component; for ϵ = ∞, those of XY-spins with 2 components. (v) Disorder, noise or random terms qualitatively aﬀect the asymptotic scaling behavior: 33 the degrees of freedom associated with randomness might generate additional unstable directions or even a novel ﬁxed-point. A well-known example is the random ﬁeld Ising model where the presence of quenched randomness induces a new critical behavior. 40,45 Renormal- ization methods are well-suited to investigate the structural stability of the renormalization ﬂow itself with respect to disorder or noise; a relevant framework to appreciate the relative inﬂuence of the diﬀerent unstable di- rections is random dynamical systems and large deviations theory. 2,4,13 1.5.4. Mapping spaces of models: universality classes Strictly speaking, the basin of attraction of the ﬁxed point φ∗ upon renor- malization action is embedded in the stable manifold Σ s(φ∗) (also called the critical manifold). Its universality class is composed of one-parameter families (φK)K crossing transversally the stable manifold in K = Kc and exhibiting the same critical behavior for K → Kc; indeed, as exposed in § 1.4.3, this behavior can be mapped onto the action of R along the unsta- ble manifold Σ u(φ∗). Accordingly, all real systems whose critical behavior involves a transverse one-parameter family of models will exhibit the same critical exponents related to the eigenvalues of DR(φ∗). By expressing the relationship between models at diﬀerent scales, the renormalized ﬂow picture allows to describe quantitatively the actual physical divergences arising at critical points in inﬁnite size (i.e., in the thermodynamic limit or in the asymptotic regime) and to prove their universality. The full non linear analysis, if tractable, would yield a partition of the space of models into universality classes, each associated with an ideally critical and self- similar model (a renormalization ﬁxed point) and grouping both models at diﬀerent scales of the same system (along a RG trajectory) and models at a given scale of diﬀerent systems sharing the same critical behavior. June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 20 A. Lesne 1.5.5. Renormalization and structural stability By shifting the study from the phase space to a space of models, renormal- ization oﬀers a way to investigate structural stability issues: two models diﬀering in a relevant parameter will see their diﬀerence increases upon renormalization while diﬀerences in irrelevant terms are damped out, cor- responding to structural stability. Renormalization can be exploited to check the robustness of a model, as regards the asymptotic scaling behav- ior, with respect to enlarging both the parameter space (adding new terms to the model rule φ) or the phase space of the model (e.g. passing from a discrete to a continuous space of states47). Renormalization is also eﬃcient to appreciate the inﬂuence of disorder on phase transitions, 33,40,45 of noise on the onset of chaos, 2,13 or of a stochastic forcing term on the large-scale behavior of the solutions of partial diﬀerential equations, e.g. Landau- Ginzburg equation, 5 hydrodynamic equations (Navier-Stokes equations 24) or equations describing the growth of an interface (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation 50); the stochastic term can represent an external noise or the in- ﬂuence of degrees of freedom not explicitly accounted for in the model. Renormalization approaches, allowing to discriminate essential noise terms for irrelevant ones, thus oﬀer a constructive and qualitative way to investi- gate the structural stability of deterministic models and the robustness of their prediction with respect to external or internal noise. 1.6. Mathematical structures of renormalization A common feature of renormalization methods presented in § 1.3 and § 1.4 is the semi-group structure of the renormalization ﬂow. It expresses jointly at several levels (variables, state functions, ﬁelds, model rules) and leads to technical simpliﬁcations in case of a continuous structure (Lie group). Investigating the renormalization group structure moreover evidences its relations with symmetry groups and hints at possible generalizations. 1.6.1. Renormalization group structure and action Let us denote ¯z = (z1, . . . , zm) a set of independent extensive variables of the model, typically chosen among the numbers of particles, linear sizes, durations, maximal amplitudes, time and space variable; ¯k = (k1, . . . , km) the associated rescaling factors (with ki ≥ 1); and R¯k the renormalization operator acting on the model rules φ. Internal consistency requires that June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 21 renormalization procedures associated with the same rescalings coincide: R¯k1 ◦ R¯k2 = R¯k1×¯k2 (× being performed pairwise) (1.21) The set {R¯k, k1 ≥ 1, . . . , km ≥ 1} of renormalization operators is thus endowed with a multiplicative semi-group structure k homomorphic to ([1, ∞] m, ×); it would be additive, homomorphic to ([0, ∞] m, +) by replac- ing ki with κi = ln ki. This homomorphism ensures that the renormaliza- tion group is commutative. Rescalings involved in R¯k should be performed so as to satisfy the group relation when iterated: for instance, rescaling a function x ↦→ f (x) writes (k·f )(x) = kf (x/k) so that (k1k2)·f = k1 ·(k2 ·f ). Internal consistency also prescribes the rescaling of related variables so as to preserve physical invariants; for instance, linear size, distances and space positions are rescaled by the same factor, say k1, whereas the number of par- ticles is rescaled by the factor kd 1 in dimension d and the local state variable ⃗s by a factor kw 1 (see § 1.4.2). More generally, we shall denote Λ (x) ¯k the rescal- ing factor acting on the quantity x, e.g. Λ(⃗r) ¯k ⃗r = ⃗r/k1 and Λ (N ) ¯k N = N/kd 1 , and by deﬁnition of the variables ¯z of reference, Λ(zi) ¯k zi = zi/ki. For any variable x, the set [Λ(x) ¯k ]¯k has the same multiplicative semi-group structure; in particular, in case of a single independent rescaling factor k, it simply writes Λ(x) k = k−α(x) where the exponent α(x) depends on the physical na- ture of x, e.g. Λ(G) k = k−2w for the correlation function G(⃗r) = ⟨⃗s(0).⃗s(r)⟩. Physical quantities are transformed upon renormalization according to: A(R¯kφ, ¯z) = Λ(A) ¯k A(φ, ¯k × ¯z) or A(R¯kφ, Λ(¯z) ¯k ¯z) = Λ(A) ¯k A(φ, ¯z) (1.22) and more generally, A(R¯kφ, Λ(¯z) ¯k ¯z, Λ(⃗r) ¯k ⃗r, Λ(x) ¯k x) = Λ(A) ¯k A(φ, ¯z, ⃗r, x) for a ﬁeld A(⃗r, x). These relations deﬁne a transformation R¯k according to: R¯k[A(φ)] = A(R¯kφ) (1.23) so that (R¯kA)(Λ(¯z) ¯k ¯z, Λ(⃗r) ¯k ⃗r, Λ(x) ¯k x) = Λ(A) ¯k A(¯z, ⃗r, x). Consistency ensures an homomorphic semi-group structure R¯k1 ◦ R¯k2 = R¯k1×¯k2. Invariance upon renormalization simply writes R¯kφ∗ = φ∗, hence R¯kA ∗ = A ∗ where A ∗ = A(φ∗), and corresponds to self-similarity. In this framework, renormalizability means that it is possible to transfer the renormalization kRegularization, § 1.2, has a group structure; by contrast, the set of renormalization transformations has generically a semi-group structure, since coarse-graining occurs with a loss of information and only rescaling factors ki ≥ 1 are relevant (or ki ≤ 1 for conjugate variables, e.g. ⃗q → k⃗q (wave vector) whereas ⃗r → ⃗r/k (position) with k ≥ 1). June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 22 A. Lesne φ → R¯kφ of the model rule φ, hence of all the state variables A, onto a transformation K → r¯k(K) of its parameters. It comes: R¯k[φ(K)] = φ[r¯k(K)] and R¯k[A(K)] = A[r¯k(K)] (1.24) Again, consistency ensures a semi-group structure r¯k1 ◦ r¯k2 = r¯k1×¯k2. 1.6.2. Renormalization group as a Lie group Focusing on the semi-group structure is of special interest when it is a continuous semi-group endowed with a diﬀerentiable structure, namely a Lie semi-group. In this case, the whole analysis can be performed in the Lie algebra generated by the inﬁnitesimal renormalization operators. Let us ﬁrst consider the case of a one-dimensional Lie semi-group (Rk)k≥1. This semi-group and its action can be thoroughly described in terms of the properties of the inﬁnitesimal generator L ≡ dRk dk (k = 1) (1.25) acting locally in scales. Fixed-point equations [∀k ≥ 1, Rkφ∗ = φ∗] equiv- alently express in a compact way: Lφ∗ = 0. Linear analysis of the renor- malization action around φ∗ can be performed on L, according to: [∀k ≥ 1, DRk(φ∗)(ϕ) = kγ ϕ ] ⇐⇒ DL(φ∗)(ϕ) = γ ϕ (1.26) All the operators [DRk(φ∗)]k≥1 commute, hence have the same eigenvec- tors, that are also eigenvectors of DL(φ∗). Due to the group structure, any eigenvalue of DRk(φ∗) is necessarily of the form kγ, where the exponent γ is independent of k and can be determined from the spectrum of DL(φ∗). The formulas extend straightforwardly to the case when the renormal- ization transformation involves m > 1 rescaling factors ¯k = (k1, . . . , km). The associated Lie algebra is m-dimensional and it is generated by m inﬁnitesimal renormalization operators Lj = (∂R¯k/∂kj)(¯k0) where ¯k0 = (1 . . . 1). It is to note that R¯k = ∏m j=1 Qkj where Qkj = R1,...,kj ,...1. These operators (Qkj )j=1...m commute so that Lj = (dQkj /dkj)(kj = 1). The m operators (Lj)j=1...m commute hence have the same eigenvectors, which coincide with the eigenvectors of any R¯k being thus ¯k-independent. Note that although the diﬀerent generators Lj commute, the limits kj → ∞ (or at the level of the model, the limits zj → ∞) do not commute. Typically, there is a unique way of performing joint rescalings, namely a unique direction ∑m j=1 γjLj = ¯γ · ¯L in the multidimensional Lie algebra, June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 23 such that the iterates under renormalization action converge to a non triv- ial limit. The remarkable point is that this direction ¯γ · ¯L gives access to the critical exponents characterizing the asymptotic behavior. Let us con- sider again the RG study of diﬀusion processes, § 1.4.3. The inﬁnitesimal generators associated to (1.15) write:10,37 B0 = (dR1,K /dK)(K = 1) [B0p](t, ⃗r) = t(∂tp)(t, ⃗r) Bi = (∂Rk,1/∂ki)(ki = 1) [Bip](t, ⃗r) = [(1 + xi.∇i)p](t, ⃗r) (1.27) showing explicitly the commutative character of the Lie group. But the limits t → ∞ and x → ∞ do not commute. The renormalization iterates converge towards a non trivial limit only for a special relation kxi = kγi t between the rescaling factors, corresponding to a single direction At + ⃗γ.A⃗r in the Lie algebra, where γi ≡ γ is the anomalous exponent ⟨⃗r(t) 2⟩ ∼ t2γ. 1.6.3. Renormalization groups and symmetry groups Renormalization action and symmetries are described in the same formal- ism of group theory. RG is besides nothing but a special symmetry group expressing the system scale invariance. Since the renormalization operator R acts upon the representations of the system (that is, its models) while preserving the system itself (that is, its physical reality), it should also preserve its symmetries. In order that the original model and its renormal- ized versions share the same symmetries properties, the renormalization operator has to commute with all symmetry transformations that leave the system (and its model) invariant. Accordingly, symmetries appear as ad- ditional constraints, but also as a guideline in deﬁning R and the relevant subspace of models in which to consider its action. Let us note that a marginal direction of the RG is in most cases as- sociated to a continuous symmetry (Sa)a>0 of the system. If (Sa)a>0 is a one-parameterl symmetry group (with Sa ◦ Sb = Sab) and φ∗ a ﬁxed point of R, then [∀a > 0, R(Saφ∗) = Saφ∗]. Either φ∗ is symmetric, i.e. invariant under the action of the symmetry group [∀a > 0, Saφ∗ = φ∗]. Ei- ther its orbit under the action of the symmetry group is non trivial and deﬁnes a one-parameter family of renormalization ﬁxed points (Saφ∗)a>0, and ∂a[Saφ∗](a = 1) is a marginal direction of DR(φ∗) associated with the eigenvalue 1 (it corresponds to a displacement along the curve (Saφ∗)a>0 of lThis case fully extends to continuous symmetry groups of higher dimension; the as- sertions that do not involve the derivative ∂aSa remain valid for a discrete symmetry group.

Moreover, in this latter case, the eigen- values of DR(Saφ∗) are obtained through the action of DSa(φ∗) from those of DR(φ∗). In other words, we get a set of ﬁxed points and a corresponding set of eigenspaces ﬁbered over the symmetry group. An important correlate is the symmetry properties of universality classes. Models belonging to the same universality class are related by renormalization-group action to the same renormalization ﬁxed-point φ∗. If φ∗ is invariant under all symmetries that are preserved by renormaliza- tion, so is the universality class, meaning that either the models of the class are symmetric or their images under the action of the symmetry group be- long to the same universality class. If φ∗ is not symmetric, the image of the class under the action of a symmetry transformation S is the universality class associated with the image Sφ∗. 1.6.4. Covariant formulation of renormalization Renormalization group can be seen as a symmetry group: we are going to show that RG action on state functions formally parallels the basic covari- ance properties of tensors upon the action of the group of rotations. The transformation upon a rotation Θ in real space of a vector ﬁeld A(.) writes ΘA(⃗r) ≡ Θ[A(Θ −1⃗r)] or equivalently ΘA(Θ⃗r) ≡ Θ[A(⃗r)] (1.28) More generally, the transformation of a tensor ﬁeld A(.) of order m writes (ΘA)i1,...,im (⃗r) ≡ ∑ j1,...,jm Θi1j1 . . . Θimjm Aj1,...,jm(Θ −1⃗r) (1.29) We have seen in § 1.6.1 a similar consistency requirement between the transformation upon renormalization of variables (e.g. space position ⃗r and size N ) state functions or ﬁelds, and model rule φ, leading to deﬁne for each quantity A a transformation R¯k such that R¯k[A(φ)] = A(R¯kφ) (1.30) or more explicitly R¯kA(Λ(¯z) ¯k ¯z, Λ(⃗r) ¯k ⃗r, Λ(x) ¯k x) = Λ(A) ¯k A(¯z, ⃗r, x) (1.31) The nonlinear dependence of R¯kA with respect to A is quite weak: it is involved in the value of the rescaling factor Λ (A) ¯k , that is identical for all quantities of the same physical nature, i.e. of the same dimension. Isotropy of the tensor ﬁeld, meaning its invariance upon rotation simply expresses ΘA = A for any rotation θ. In a similar way, scale invariance June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 25 writes R¯kA = A for any set of rescaling factors ¯k. Note that if the model rule is a renormalization ﬁxed point φ∗, i.e. R¯kφ∗ = φ∗, then all state functions are invariant upon renormalization; but a state function could be scale invariant, i.e. R¯kA = A, in a model that is not fully invariant upon renormalization. In the same way, the trivial vector ﬁeld everywhere equal to 0 is isotropic whatever the system is, whereas the system has to be itself isotropic in order that all vector ﬁelds are invariant upon any rotation. For example, if there is a single independent rescaling factor k and Λ (A) ¯k = k−α, scale invariance writes: kα A(⃗r) = A(k⃗r); if A(r) is the mass contained in a sample of radius r of the scale invariant system, α is its fractal dimension. Renormalization thus expresses a covariance property, with scale invariance replacing Galilean invariance and fractal geometry replacing Euclidean geometry. Roughly, a representation describes a set of observable consequences of the group action. The relation R¯k[A(φ)] = A(R¯kφ) deﬁnes a representa- tion R¯k ↦→ R¯k of the renormalization group in the space of state functions. The consistency of renormalization, acting at the same time on the vari- ables (time, space), the state (conﬁguration, ﬁeld) and the functional that rules the system equation or evolution (action, Hamiltonian, vector ﬁeld, transition probabilities), expresses through commutative diagrams: φ −→ R¯kφ φ −→ R¯kφ ↓ ↓ ↑ ↑ A −→ R¯kA K −→ r¯k(K) (1.32) Accordingly, RG could be naturally embedded in the framework of category theory. The simplest explicit example is the temporal RG for the period- doubling scenario. 15,21,37 The variable is here the time t, and Rt = t/2 (namely k = 2). The state is here the position x in the phase space [−1, 1] and Rx = λx where the rescaling factor λ involves the evolution law f according to λ = f (t = 1, x = 1). Finally, the renormalization writes (Rf )(t, x) = λf (2t, x/λ) = R[f (R−1t, R −1x)]. These multi-level renormalization transformations can be summarized under the form of a June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 26 A. Lesne commutative diagram as follows: (t, x) f −→ f (t, x) (R, R) ↓ ↓ R (Rt, Rx) Rf −→ R[f (t, x)] = Rf (Rt, Rx) The general structure of RG can ﬁnally be formulated as follows. It acts on a ﬁber bundle (Fg)g∈G over an arbitrary set G, possibly ordered or even partly ordered. The renormalization operator Rg1g0 is a transformation from Fg0 to Fg1 that satisﬁes the semi-group relation Rg2g1 ◦Rg1g0 = Rg2g0 for any triplet g0, g1 and g2 in G and possibly a constraint g2 ≥ g1 ≥ g0 (the chain rule being ill-deﬁned if there is no ordering or an inconsistent ordering between g0, g1 and g2), and Rgg(φ) = φ for any g ∈ G and φ ∈ Fg. Moreover, the chain rule consistency imposes a constraint on the domains and images: Im[Rg1g0] ⊂ Dom[Rg2g1] ⊂ Fg1. These operators R deﬁne a parallel transport on the ﬁber bundle. The semi-group structure of this extended RG is homomorphic to the semi-group structure embedded in Γ = G × G, with (g2, g1) × (g1, g0) = (g2, g0) and the ordering consistency. The RG is actually a group if and only if the transformations Rg1g0 are invertible, with inverse Rg0g1 ; it is then homomorphic to the full group Γ. 1.7. Conclusion: a deep epistemological shift The usual approach in theoretical physics is to consider a given model and try to extract as much information as possible by studying the solution (evolution, equilibrium state) ruled by this model. But such an approach is unavoidably ﬂawed by the idealizations and approximations involved in devising the model, that is, a limited representation of the real system in- volving arbitrary choice of description scales and keeping some degrees of freedom while ignoring other details. Renormalization approach is totally diﬀerent. In focusing on the dependence on the observation scale and ex- pressing how our models and theories change when we change the scale of our description, renormalization gives access to a more objective knowledge about the system. An illustration of this idea is a fractal curve: its length l(a) is a quantity depending on the observation scale a; by contrast, the relation l(ka) = k1−Df l(a) between the lengths l(a) and l(ka) measured June 2, 2008 17:29 World Scientiﬁc Review Volume - 9in x 6in RG-WS-Lesne-v3 Regularization, renormalization, and renormalization groups 27 at diﬀerent scales a and ka involves an intrinsic quantity Df , namely the fractal dimension of the curve. Replacing the study of a given model by the study of the renormaliza- tion ﬂow is naturally suited to investigate structural stability of the models and robustness of their predictions. This allows to split this space into universality classes grouping models at diﬀerent scales of a given system, and also, at a given scale, models of diﬀerent systems exhibiting the same large-scale behavior. In this way, RG is able to transform qualitative in- formation (the belonging to the same universality class) into quantitative information (the values of the critical exponents and expression of scaling functions); conversely, it enlarges the scope of numerical computation of the critical exponents by assessing their universality and the structural sta- bility of the model used in the computation. RG has thus a deep impact on the epistemological level, changing our way to consider and devise models, hence changing our very theoretical approach of real systems. RG theory today oﬀers several perspectives42 and novel directions to be further explored. It seems promising to investigate the physical interpre- tation of RG ﬂow features other than hyperbolic ﬁxed points. Asymptotic behavior of renormalization trajectories more complicated than the conver- gence towards a ﬁxed point, e.g. a limit cycle or a chaotic behavior, are indeed possible. 39,53 Renormalization group analysis could be generalized using recent extensions of Lie group theory, e.g. local group structures that would allow to extend RG into an assembly of local versions m in the spirit of gauge theories extending global symmetries into space-dependent local versions. One could envision RG based on other symmetries than scale invariance, e.g. to handle any pair of non commuting limits (without nec- essarily one being associated to time or size); renormalization would then relate models of the same system along another parameter axis than space or time scales. Another direction could be to develop RG extensions on the basis of general covariance properties within the framework of cate- gory theory. Let us ﬁnally mention recent and promising insights into the mathematical structures of renormalization in QFT: the Feynman graphs mThis idea is reminiscent of the notion of ‘scale covariance’ proposed by Pocheau43 in the context of fully developed turbulence, amounting to consider local reference frames, and to express more reﬁned scale invariance properties as covariance properties with respect to changes of the local reference frame; let us also mention the somehow related ‘generalized scale invariance’ introduced by Dubrulle,19 expressed with respect to a gen- eralized scale variable deﬁned as a combination of the length scale and other relevant quantities.
