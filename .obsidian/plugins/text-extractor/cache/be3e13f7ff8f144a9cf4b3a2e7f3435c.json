André Marie Ampére (1775- 1836) Andre AmpereNature of Current • Experimentally, recognizable effects of current flow are: 1. Heating 2. Magnetic fields 7 Current in a Conductor • Consider a current flowing through a conductor: current is caused by electrons moving with average drift velocity (due to applied E-field), v • In time ∆𝑡 the volume swept out is 𝐴𝑣∆𝑡 8 n v 𝑣∆𝑡 Area, A Current in a Conductor 9 n v 𝑣∆𝑡 Area, A If there are n conducting electrons per unit volume: the total charge in this volume is: ∆𝑄 = 𝑛 𝐴𝑣∆𝑡 (−𝑒) Therefore: 𝑰 = Δ𝑄 Δ𝑡 = −𝑛𝐴𝑒𝒗 Negative charge Current Density • The current per unit cross-section (area) is called the current density, J 10 𝑱 = 𝑰 𝐴 = −𝑛𝑒𝒗 Typically, the net drift velocity of conducting electrons when a current is flowing 𝑣 < 1 𝑚𝑚/𝑠 Magnetic Force on Moving Charge • A magnetic field exerts a force 𝑭𝑚 on any moving charge (or current) that is present in the field. • A particle of charge +q moving with velocity v in a magnetic field B experiences a force 𝑭𝑚. • Experimentally: – 𝑭𝑚is ⊥ v and B, – 𝑭𝑚 ∝ 𝒗, 𝑭𝑚 ∝ 𝑩, – 𝑭𝑚 ∝ 𝑞 11 Fm  B v 𝐹𝑚 = 𝐵𝑞𝑣 sin 𝜃 Magnetic Force on Moving Charge 12 Fm  B v In vector form 𝑭𝑚 = 𝑞𝒗𝑩 Direction of Magnetic Force • 𝑭𝑚 = 𝑞𝒗𝑩 = ෡𝑭𝑞𝑣𝐵 sin 𝜃 • The direction of 𝑭𝒎 is: 13 Use Right-Hand Rule Fm  B v 𝑭𝑚 = 𝑞𝒗𝑩 𝒗 𝑩 Tesla • 𝑭𝑚 = 𝑞𝒗𝑩 • The unit of B is N C-1 m-1 s • It’s given the name Tesla (T) • in honour of Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943) 14 N C ms-1 • The unit of Gauss (1G = 10-4 T) is sometimes used but the S.I unit is Tesla. Tesla • If 1 C of charge moving at 1 m/s perpendicular to a magnetic field experiences a force of 1 Newton, the magnetic field is 1 Tesla. • Earth’s magnetic field  5  10-5 T ( 0.5 Gauss) • Poles of a large electromagnet  2 T • Surface of a neutron star  108 T • The magnetic field that can be created in Lab ~ 50 T. 15 Earth’s Magnetic Field • The origin of the Earth’s magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive iron alloys of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core although not completely understood yet. • The North and South poles swap places on average every ~ 300,000 years. • The last time the poles swap was 780,000 years ago ! – It take  7000 years to switch 16 Lorentz Force • In regions where both E and B fields are present, the total force is the vector sum of the electric and magnetic forces: 17 𝑭 = 𝑞(𝑬 + 𝒗  𝑩) In direction of E ⊥ to v and B Lorentz Equation (you need to know this) Example 11.1 • The Earth’s magnetic field at a particular region is represented by • 𝑩 = 𝐵 cos 70𝑜𝒋 − 𝐵 sin 70𝑜𝒌 (B = 5 x 10-5 T) • A proton is moving in this magnetic field with a velocity • 𝒗 = 10 7 𝒋 𝑚/𝑠 • Obtain an expression for the direction and magnitude of magnetic force acting on the proton. • Visualizer Time 18 Exercise 11.2 • True or False: The magnetic force does not accelerate a moving charged particle because the force is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. • FALSE (it does but not in the direction of travel) • Ex 11.2: What is the force acting on an electron with velocity 𝒗 = 2𝒊 − 3𝒋 × 106 𝑚/𝑠 • In a magnetic field: 𝑩 = 0.8𝒊 + 0.6𝒋 − 0.4𝒌 𝑇 ? 19 Let’s do it on the visualizer Magnetic Field Lines 20 NOTE: unlike electric field lines, magnetic field lines are ALWAYS continuous (no magnetic monopoles) and they do not point in the direction of the force on the moving charge in a magnetic field. Current upper limit on magnetic monopoles per nucleon is < 10-29 (4x1028 nucleons in your body) Magnetic Field Lines 21 •the tangent to a field line at a point P gives the direction of B at that point •the number of field lines drawn per unit cross sectional area is proportional to the magnitude of B Magnetic Flux B 22 The magnetic flux ∆𝑩 passing through the small area A shown is defined by: ∆∅𝐵 = 𝐵 cos 𝜃 × ∆𝐴 ∅𝐵 = ׬𝑆 𝐵 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 Gauss ’s Law for Magnetism • For E-fields, net electric flux: ׬𝑆 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 𝑄𝑒𝑛𝑐 𝜀0 • But there are no magnetic monopoles so for magnetic fields: • Net magnetic flux: • ׬𝑆 𝐵 ∙ 𝑑𝑆 = 0 23 (not much use for this course but does form Maxwell’s 2nd equation) Summary • A magnetic field B is defined in terms of the force Fm acting on a test particle with charge q and moving through the field with velocity v: • The general case of both B-fields and E-fields is the Lorentz equation (Lorentz Force): 24 𝑭𝑚 = 𝑞𝒗𝑩 𝑭 = 𝑞(𝑬 + 𝒗  𝑩)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
