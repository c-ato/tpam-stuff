Find the derivatives of the following functions according to the definition, where they exist. (a) f (x) = x 3. (b) f (x) = cos x. Please note that only the definition of derivative can be used, and one should not assume these functions are differentiable a priori. In particular, one should not use L’Hospital’s rule to evaluate the limits involved. You can use properties of limits and notable limits discussed in lectures (lecture notes). (SUM) Q10. Find the derivatives of the following functions. Detailed computation is needed. (a) f (x) = 2x3 + 5x2 − 1, (c) f (x) = ln(x2 + 1), (e) f (x) = (x sin x) x, (b) f (x) = x ln x, (d) f (x) = (x − 1)(x − 2) x 1 3 , (f ) f (x) = cos(sin x). (SUM) Q11. Determine the types of the following indeterminate form ( 0 0 , ∞ ∞ , 0·∞, ∞−∞, 0 0, ∞0, 1∞), and use L’Hospital’s rule to find their limits where applicable: (a) lim x→ 1 2 6x2 + 5x − 4 4x2 + 16x − 9 (b) lim x→∞ ln x √x (c) lim x→1 x 8 − 1 x5 − 1 (d) lim x→0+(1 + sin 3x) 1/x 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
