[1 mark] The actual Schwarzschild radius of the event horizon of a black hole turns out to be twice this value, or about 3 km for a black hole with mass M\u0000 —but beingabletoget within afactor oftwooftheright answer without knowing anything about general relativity shows the power of dimensional analysis! (2) The only way to get something with units of power [kg m2 s\u00003]out of the constants G,with units [m3 kg\u00001 s\u00002], and c,with units of [m s \u00001], is via c5 G [2 marks] and c5 G =3.6 ⇥ 1052 W. [1 mark] The actual answer is about a factor of a hundred smaller because of various prefactors – but, again, getting close to the right answer without knowing anything about gravitational waves is impressive! (3) According to Wikipedia, a solar luminosity is 3.8 ⇥ 1026 W. Multiplying this by 1021 Sun-like stars in the visible Universe, the total power emitted by all stars in the visible Universe is only ⇠ 4 ⇥ 1047 W. [1 mark] Thus, the one gravitational-wave event brieﬂy outshone the entire Uni- verse by several orders of magnitude! [1 mark] (4) Total horizontal displacement: [4.0+3.1cos(45 \u0000)] km ' 6.2km Total vertical displacement: [2.6+3.1sin(45\u0000)] km ' 4.8km Total displacement: p6.22 +4.82 km ' 7.8km [1 mark] Angle from the horizontal: arctan(4.8/6.2) ' 38\u0000 [1 mark] 2.6 km 4.0 km 3.1 km [1 mark] Quantum Mechanics 1 – Solution 1 a) As the alpha particle experiences a head-on collision, it comes to momentary rest at a certain distance of closest approach, !\"#$. When the alpha particle comes to rest, its kinetic energy is zero and the energy of the two-body system is in the form of electrostatic potential energy. Because energy must be conserved, at the distance of closest approach the electrostatic potential energy must equal the initial kinetic energy of the alpha particle: %&' = )*)+,+ 4./0!\"#$. [3 marks] Rearranging, !\"#$ = \t )*)+,+ 4./0%&'. Substituting Z1 = 2 (alpha) and Z2 = 79 (gold) and converting %&' from MeV into Joules, gives !\"#$ = 2 × 79 × (1.6 × 10;*<)+ 4 × . × 8.85 × 10;*+ × (7\tMeV × 1.6 × 10;*C\tJ/MeV), so !\"#$ = 3.25 × 10;*H\tm. [3 marks] b) Note that !\"#$ is proportional to the charge of the projectile. Since we are told that the energy of the proton is the same as the alpha particle in part a), the only difference is that the charge of the proton is half that of the alpha particle, so the distance of closest approach is also halved. Thus, for a 7 MeV proton !\"#$ = 1.63 × 10;*H\tm. [2 marks] c) Rutherford also calculated the scattering probability as a function of angle, assuming that both the alpha particle and the gold nucleus are point-like charges. If the alpha particle dived into the gold nucleus this would have changed the 1/r dependence of the potential at small distances, like the calculation we did in class, resulting in a different scattering probability at large angles. Because the observed angular distribution of alpha particles agreed with his calculation, Rutherford knew that the alpha particle had not impacted the gold nucleus. Thus, the radius of the gold nucleus must be smaller than the value of !\"#$ calculated in part a). (In fact, the radius of a gold nucleus is about 7.3 fm.) [2 marks]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
