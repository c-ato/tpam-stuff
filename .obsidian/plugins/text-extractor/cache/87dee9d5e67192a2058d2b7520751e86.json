Problem 3.1 More complicated outcomes 1. There are 2 ways out of 6 possibilities, so p = 1/3. 2. There are 3 ways out of six, so p = 1/2. Problem 3.2 Many balls 1. Total number of balls is 9, of which 3 are black, therefore p(black) = 1/3. 2. Number of ways to get not red is 5, therefore p = 5/9. Problem 3.3 Family probabilities 1. There are 4 possible arrangements and 3 of these have at least one girl, therefore p = 3/4. 2. If at least one is a girl, we are now limited to 3 of the possible 4 arrangements: out of these 3, only one contains 2 girls, therefore p = 1/3. 3. p = 1/2. Chance has no memory! Problem 3.4 An irritating queue To be chosen on the third call requires you not to be chosen on any of the ﬁrst 2. Therefore p(chosen on 3rd call, but not on ﬁrst two) = p(not being chosen on ﬁrst 2 calls) × p(chosen on 3rd) = 9/10 × 8/9 × 1/8 = 1/10 . Problem 3.5 Monkeys, typewriters and Shakespeare The probability of getting the ﬁrst character right is 1/44. The probability of getting 10 5 consecutive characters right is (1/44) 105. Your calculator probably won’t cope with this one, but you can take logs: log(probability) = 105 × log(1/44) = −164, 345 . so the probability of getting 10 5 consecutive characters right is 10 −164,345. 3 PROBABILITY REVISION – SOLUTIONS 2 Now we need to work out the number of attempts that the monkeys get. The monkeys can type 10 × 10 18 characters in the age of the universe and so there are 10 19 − 10 5 ≃ 10 19 sequences of 10 5 successive characters in which Hamlet could occur. Also there are 10 20 monkeys. The probability of typing Hamlet is therefore 10 −164,345 × 10 19 × 10 20 = 10 −164,306. A good enough deﬁnition of impossible? Problem 3.6 Penalty shoot-out 1. p(exactly 2 goals) = 3 4 3 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 5C2 , where the binomial coeﬃcient 5C2 accounts for the fact that it doesn’t matter which 2 of the 5 penalties were scored. 5C2 = 5! 3!2! ⇒ p(exactly 2 goals) = 90 1024 . 2. p(at least one goal) = 1 − p(no goals) = 1 − (1 4 )5 = 1023 1024 . Problem 3.7 Bill and Ben, gambling men There are 6 diﬀerent ways to throw a double out of a total of 36 possibilities. The probability of a double on a single throw is thus 1/6. The probability that Bill is ﬁrst to throw a double is the probability that he throws one straight away (1/6) plus the probability that neither he nor Ben throws a double in the ﬁrst round (5/6 × 5/6) multiplied by the probability that Bill throws a double on the second round (1/6), and so on ..... p(Bill wins) = 1 6 + 1 6 ( 5 6 )2 + 1 6 (5 6 )4 + · · · = 1 6 [ 1 + ( 25 36 ) + (25 36 )2 + · · · ] . which is a geometric series, which we must sum to inﬁnity: p(Bill wins) = 1 6 ∞∑ n=1 ( 25 36 )n−1 = 1 6 1 (1 − 25/36) = 2 3 . 3 PROBABILITY REVISION – SOLUTIONS 3 Problem 3.8 Combinatorics There are 7 ways (available microstates): taking the atoms in turn, we can have 1ϵ 1ϵ 1ϵ 2ϵ 1ϵ 0 2ϵ 0 1ϵ 0 2ϵ 1ϵ 1ϵ 2ϵ 0 1ϵ 0 2ϵ 0 1ϵ 2ϵ So 7 ways altogether.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
