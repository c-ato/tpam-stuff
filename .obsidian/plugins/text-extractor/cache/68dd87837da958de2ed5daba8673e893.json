(a) Mr. and Mrs. Superﬂy retreat in opposite directions from a ﬂyswat with speeds 3c/4 relative to the ﬂyswat. What speed does Mrs. Superﬂy have relative to Mr. Superﬂy? (b) Having escaped the ﬂyswat, Mr. and Mrs Superﬂy enjoy a well deserved rest together by the side of a railway track. To their horror, they realise that baby Superﬂy is trapped inside the Birmingham to Wolverhampton express train which, as is well known, travels with a speed 3c/5 relative to the track. The guard in the train notices that Baby Superﬂy crawls vertically up a window with a speed c/2 relative to the window. What do Mr. and Mrs. Superﬂy decide is Baby Superﬂy’s speed relative to the track and in what direction do they judge Baby Superﬂy to be travelling? 2. Two frames of reference Σ and Σ′ are in the usual standard conﬁguration with respect to each other. Their origins coincide at t = t′ = 0 and Σ′ moves to the right along the common x − x′ axis. An object moves, in the frame of reference Σ′, with a velocity V ′ y parallel to the y′ axis. (a) Show that an observer in Σ judges the object to have velocity components (Vx, Vy) where Vx = u and Vy = V ′ y/γ(u). Show that an observer in Σ judges the object to have velocity components (Vx, Vy) where Vx = u and Vy = V ′ y/γ(u). (b) The diagram shows two beetles A and B. In the frame of reference Σ′ which has a velocity u along the x − x′ axis relative to the frame Σ, the beetles move perpendicular to the x′−axis and parallel to the y′ axis of Σ′ with a velocity V0 and for convenience beetle A has elected to move along the y′ axis of Σ′ as shown. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Example Sheet 2 The line AB joining the beetles remains parallel to the x′ axis and has a length L0 in the frame of reference Σ′. The beetles A and B each cross the x′ axis at a time t′ = 0 and remain separated in Σ′ by a horizontal distance L0 along the x′ axis so that the line AB joining the beetles is, and remains, parallel to the x′ axis. What space and time coordinates does an observer in the frame Σ ascribe to the two events consisting of A′s crossing the x′ axis of Σ′ at t′ = 0 and B′s crossing the x′ axis of Σ′ at t′ = 0? Show that these events are not simultaneous in Σ and ﬁnd the time diﬀerence between these events as judged by an observer in Σ. (c) What angle does the line AB joining the two beetles make with the horizontal x axis? 3. It is well known that the speed limit for a rocket in space is 2 × 107 km hr −1. A rocket travelling to a remote planet is piloted by a physicist and is arrested for driving through a set of red light in space. At the subsequent trial the physicist claims that the car was going so fast that the red light appeared green to the pilot. ”Plea accepted” said the judge, ”but I ﬁne you £ 1 for each kilometer per hour by which you exceeded the speed limit.” If the wavelength of green light is 530 nm and that of red light is 630 nm, calculate the ﬁne. 4. The Hα line has a wavelength 656.3 nm when measured by an observer who is at rest with respect to the hydrogen atom. What is the Doppler shift of this line from a star which moves directly away from the Earth with a velocity 300 km s−1? 5. A force F acts on a particle with rest mass m0 and which moves along the x−axis. The work done by the force in displacing the particle through a distance dx is F dx = F udt where u = dx/dt is the velocity of the particle. This work done by the force is the change, dE, in the energy of the particle so that dE/dt = F u. (a) Show that use of the Newtonian relation between F and the non relativistc mo- mentum of the particle leads to the expression ∆E = ∆ ( m0u2 2 ) = change in the non relativistic kinetic energy (b) If γ(u) = 1/(1 − u2/c2), show that dγ(u) dt = u ˙u c2 γ3(u) DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Special Theory of Relativity Example Sheet 2 (c) Show that if the relativistic momentum p = m(u)u is used in the expression F = dp/dt, then the change in the energy of the particle is given by ∆E = ∆(m(u)c 2) where m(u) = γ(u)m0. This calculation is yet another argument for writing E = mc2. 6. ⋆ A pion has rest mass 139.58MeV and a mean-lifetime of 2.5 × 10−8 s whereas a muon has rest mass 105.65MeV and a mean-lifetime of 2.2 × 10−6 s. A pion usually decays into a muon and a neutrino. You may assume that a neutrino is massless and lives forever. Assuming that the pion is initially at rest, ﬁnd the velocity of the muon and the mean- distance that the muons travel in the pion rest-frame. 7. The deuteron is the nucleus of ”heavy hydrogen” and is made up of a neutron and a proton bound together. The deuteron has a mass md = 3.3433 × 10−27 kg. An unbound proton has a mass mp = 1.6724 × 10−27 kg and an unbound neutron has a mass mn = 1.6747 × 10−27 kg. When a neutron and a proton fuse to form a deuteron an energy ∆E, equivalent to the mass diﬀerence (mn + mp − md) is released as heat. Calculate this energy release in both Joules and M eV. Estimate very roughly the energy that would be released in forming 1 g of deuterium by fusing together an appropriate number of neutrons and protons. How long would a 10 M W power station need to run to produce this quantity of energy? 8. (a) A particle with rest mass m0 has a velocity u. For what value of u/c does the momentum of the particle diﬀer by 1% from its non-relativistic value m0u. Is the correct relativistic value greater or less than that obtained from the non-relativistic result? (b) In a chemical reaction in which 1 kg of hydrogen combines with 8 kg of oxygen to give 9 kg of water about 108 J of heat are released. To what mass is this equivalent? How does the fractional change in mass in this chemical reaction compare with the fractional mass change in a nuclear fusion process such as that described in the previous question? DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Solutions to Example Sheet 2 1. (a) Mr. Superﬂy is on the left and Mrs. Superﬂy on the right. In the middle is the ﬂyswat. Each retreats from the ﬂyswat with velocity 3c/4 relative to the ﬂyswat. Care is needed here because we have three frames of reference - that of Mr. Superﬂy, that of the swat and ﬁnally the frame of Mars Superﬂy. The Lorentz Transformations deal with pairs of frames of reference in uniform motion with respect to each other. In the frame in which Mr. Superﬂy is at rest, the swat moves to the right with velocity 3c/4. However in the frame of reference in which the swat is at rest, Mrs. Superﬂy has a velocity 3c/4 to the right of the swat. In order to calculate the velocity of Mrs. Superﬂy relative to Mr. Superﬂy we thus need to use the relativistic composition law for velocities in which we think of Mr. Superﬂy as being at rest, the swat as having a velocity u1 = 3c/4 relative to the Mr. Superﬂy, and Mrs. Superﬂy as having a velocity u2 = 3c/4 relative to the swat. Mrs. Superﬂy’s velocity V relative to Mr. Superﬂy is then given by using the relativistic composition law with both u1 = 3c/4 and u2 = 3c/3. V = (u1 + u2) (1 + u1u2/c2) = 3c/4 + 3c/4 1 + (3c/4) (3c/4)/c2 = 3c/2 1 + 9/16 = 3c 2 × 16 25 = 24 25 c. Thus V < c as expected. It is tempting but wrong to focus on the swat and say that the relative velocity of the two ﬂies must me 3c/4 + 3c/4 = 3c/2 (> c)! (b) Let Σ be the frame of reference of the track in which Mr. and Mrs. Superﬂy are at rest after their exertions and let Σ′ be the frame of reference of the train in which the train is at rest. In the frame of reference Σ′ of the train, Baby Superﬂy has only a vertical component of velocity V ′ y = c/2 as he crawls up the window. However the train has a velocity u = 3c/5 relative to the track. We know that if the components of the velocity of Baby Superﬂy are (V ′ x, V ′ y) relative to the train (i.e. in Σ′) then relative the the track Baby Superﬂy will have a velocity with components (Vx, Vy) with Vx = u + V ′ x 1 + uV ′ x/c2 and Vy = 1 γ(u) V ′ y 1 + uV ′ x/c2 where u is the speed in the common x − x′ direction of Σ′ relative to Σ. In this problem Baby Superﬂy moves vertically up the window of the train and so V ′ x = 0. Thus in this problem Vx = u and Vy = V ′ y γ(u) Since u = 3c/5, γ(u) = 1/√ 1 − (3c/5)2 = 5/4 and V ′ y = c/2 we ﬁnd that Vx = 3c 5 and Vy = c/2 5/4 = 2c 5 . Thus relative to the track, Baby Superﬂy has a speed √ V 2 x + V 2 y = (c/5) √32 + 22 = c √13/5 and crawls in a direction making and angle θ to the horizontal given by tan θ = Vy/Vx = 2/3 → θ = tan−1(2/3) ≃ 33.70 or 0.57 rad. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Solutions to Example Sheet 2 2. (a) Σ′ moves to the right along the x − x′ axis relative to Σ. V ′ x = dx′/dt′, but dx′ = γ(u)(dx − udt) and dt′ = γ(u) (dt − udx/c2) and hence V ′ x = dx′ dt′ = γ(u)(dx − udt) γ(u) (dt − udx/c2) = dx/dt − u 1 − u(dx/dt)/c2 = Vx − u 1 − Vx/c2 V ′ y = dy′ dt′ = dy γ(u) (dt − udx/c2) = dy/dt γ(u) (1 − u(dx/dt)/c2) = Vy γ(u) (1 − Vx/c2) . In Σ the object has a velocity with components Vx = 0 and Vy and so V ′ x = −u and V ′ y = Vy γ(u). The ﬁrst expression simply simply tells us that Σ retreats from Σ′ in the negative direction with speed u. (b) The two frames are in standard conﬁguration in which the origins coincide at t = t′ = 0 and so if A, crosses the x−axis at x = 0 and t = 0, then in Σ′, A will cross the x′ axis at x′ = 0 and t′ = 0. B will then cross the x − x′−axis at x′ = L0 and at t′ = 0 since we are told the line AB remains parallel to the x−axis. The Lorentz Transformation equations will give the coordinates in Σ of the event that B crosses the x − x′ axis. x = γ(u)(x′ + ut′) = γ(u)(L0 + u × 0) = γ(u)L0 and t = γ(u)(0 + uL0/c 2). Thus in the frame of reference Σ, B crosses the common x − x′ axis at a time t = uγ(u)L0/c2 i.e. in Σ, B will cross the x − x′ axis after A crosses this axis by an amount uγ(u)L0/c2 seconds i.e. the events of A and of B crossing the x − x′ axis are not simultaneous in Σ′. The velocity in Σ of the line joining AB is(V ′ x, V ′ y) = (0, V0) , and so its velocity components in Σ are (Vx, Vy) = (u, V0/γ(u)) . We have shown that an observer in Σ judges A to cross the axis at t′ = 0, and B to cross the axis at a time later than this by uγ(u)L0/c2. In this time interval an observer in Σ judges B to move vertically parallel to the y′ axis through a distance Vy × uγ(u)L0/c 2 = V0 γ(u) × uγ(u)L0 c2 = uV0L0 c2 and horizontally through a distance Vx × (uγ(u)L0/c 2) = (u) × (uγ(u)L0/c 2) = γ(u) u2 c2 L0. (c) To obtain the horizontal separation of A and B, we must note the position of A and of B in the same frame in which the measurement is being made. A crosses the axis at t = 0 but B crosses the axis at the later time t = uγ(u)L0/c2 and at a position x = γ(u)L0. However in Σ, B has a horizontal velocity component Vx = u, and so in the time interval uγ(u)L0/c2 its horizontal position changes by Vx × (uγ(u)L0/c2) = u2γ(u)L0/c2. Thus we need to measure the horizontal separation of A and B at the same time in Σ γ(u)L0−γ(u) u2 c2 L0 = γ(u)L0 ( 1 − u2 c2 ) = L0 (1 − u2/c2) √ (1 − u2/c2) = L0√(1 − u2/c2) = L0 γ(u) . DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Solutions to Example Sheet 2 At a time t = t′ = 0, in Σ, the line AB will make an angle θ with the common x − x′ axis given by tan θ′ = uV0L0/c2 L0/γ(u) = γ(u) V0u c2 . 3. Choose λ0 = 630 nm to be the wavelength of the red light and λ = 530 nm to be the wavelength of the green light then λ λ0 = 530 630 = √ 1 − u/c 1 + u/c → ( 530 630 )2 = 1 − u/c 1 + u/c ≃ .708 → u c = 0.171 u ≃ 0.171 × 3 × 10 8 ms−1 ≃ 0.51 × 10 8 ms−1 = 5.1 × 10 7 ms−1 = 5.1 × 10 4 kms−1 = 5.1 × 10 4 × 3600 km hr−1 = 18.4 × 10 7km hr −1 The speed limit is 2 × 107 km hr −1 and so the driver exceeded the speed limit by(18.4 × 107 − 2 × 107) km hr −1 = 16.4 × 107km hr −1 and so the pilot of the rocket pays a ﬁne of £1.64 × 107. That will teach her to speed! 4. We have a relativistic Doppler Shift with source and observer retreating and so ν = ν0 ( 1 − u/c 1 + u/c )1/2 . Since c = νλ = ν0λ0 we have λ = λ0 ( 1 + u/c 1 − u/c )1/2 . Since u = 300 km s −1 = 300 × 103m s−1 = 3 × 105m s−1 then taking c = 3 × 108m s−1 we see that u/c = 10−3 and so λ = λ0 ( 1 + 10−3 1 − 10−3 )1/2 = λ0 ( 1.001 .999 )1/2 ≃ 1.001λ0. The shift in wavelength is λ − λ0 = 0.001λ0 ≃ 0.656 nm. 5. (a) The energy change of the non relativistic particle is the work done on if by the force F dE = F dx = F dx dt dt = F udt where u = dx/dt dE dt = F u. By Newton’s second law for a non relativistic particle F = dp dt = dm0u dt = m0 du dt → dE dt = m0 du dt u. But u du dt = 1 2 d dt (u 2) → dE dt = m0 2 du2 dt = d dt ( 1 2 m0u 2) → E = 1 2 m0u 2 + const DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Solutions to Example Sheet 2 The change ∆E in E when the velocity changes from u1 to u2 is thus ∆E = 1 2 m0u 2 2 − 1 2 m0u 2 1 as required. (b) The relativistic calculation is a little more complicated. we use the equation dE/dt = F u to deﬁne E. However p is now the relativistic momentum given by p = m(u)u = m0γ(u)u (rather than just m0u). F = dp dt = m0 d dt (γ(u)u) = m0 ( u dγ(u) dt + γ(u) du dt ) dγ(u) dt = dγ(u) du × du dt = du dt ( d(1 − u2/c2)−1/2 du ) = ˙u ( − 1 2 × (− 2u c2 ) (1 − u 2/c 2) −3/2 = ˙uu c2 1 (1 − u2/c2)3/2 = ˙uu c2 γ3(u) F = m0 ( u × ˙uu c2 γ3(u) + γ(u) du dt ) = m0 ( u × ˙uu c2 γ3(u) + γ(u) ˙u ) = m0 ˙u ( u2 c2 γ3(u) + γ(u)) Thus F u = m0u ˙u ( u2 c2 γ3(u) + γ(u) ) = m0u ˙uγ3(u) ( u2 c2 + 1 γ2(u) ) = m0u ˙uγ3(u) ( u2 c2 + 1 − u2 c2 ) = m0u ˙uγ3(u). But d dt m(u)c 2 = c 2m0 dγ(u) dt = c 2m0 dγ(u) du × du dt = c 2m0 ˙u d(1 − u2/c2)−1/2 du = c 2m0 ˙u × (− 1 2 ) ( − 2u c2 ) (1 − u 2/c 2)−3/2 = m0 ˙uuγ3(u) Hence F u = m0u ˙uγ3(u) = d dt m(u)c 2. But F u = dE/dt and so F u = dE dt = d dt m(u)c 2. Integrating this gives that a change ∆m(u) in th mass give s rise to a change ∆E = ∆(m(u)c 2) = c 2∆(m(u)) so that a change ∆m(u) in the mass gives rise to a change c2∆m(u) = ∆E in the mechanical energy of the particle. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Solutions to Example Sheet 2 6. We start with the pion at rest, so its energy and momentum are Ei = mπc 2 , Pi = 0 After the decay the produced muon and neutrino are moving away from each other along the line which we assume to coincide with x-axis. The muon moves with velocity V in the positive x-direction and the neutrino moves with momentum p in the negative x-direction. The energy and momentum of the muon are Eµ = mµc2 √ 1 − V 2 c2 , Pµ = mµV √ 1 − V 2 c2 and those of the neutrino are Eν = cp , Pν = −p . The conservation of energy/mass gives Ei = mπc 2 = Ef = Eµ + Eν = mµc2 √ 1 − V 2 c2 + cp and the conservation of momentum gives Pi = 0 = Pf = Pµ + Pν = mµV √ 1 − V 2 c2 − p Substituting p from the last equation into the energy conservation gives mπ = mµ √ 1 − V 2 c2 + mµV /c √ 1 − V 2 c2 = mµ √ 1 + V /c 1 − V /c , hence m2 π m2 µ = 1 + V /c 1 − V /c , V /c = m2 π − m2 µ m2 π + m2 µ ≃ 0.27 . If the life-time of the muon in its rest-frame is τ , then as a result of time dilation its mean life-time in the frame where it moves with velocity V will be τ ′ = γ(V )τ and the mena distance traveled is L = V τ ′ = 0.27cτ √ 1 − (0.27)2 ≃ 185m . 7. Let mp,mn and md be the masses of the proton,neutron and deuteron respectively. Then mp + mn = (1.6724 + 1.6747) × 10 −27 kg and md = 3.3433 × 10−27 kg. Thus (mp + mn − md) = 0.0038 × 10 −27 kg = 3.8 × 10 −30 kg. DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Solutions to Example Sheet 2 Thus the energy released is ∆E = (mp + mn − md) c 2 ≃ (3.8 × 10 −30 × 9 × 1016) J ≃ 3.4 × 10 −13J where we have taken c ≃ 3 × 108 ms−1. But 1eV ≡ 1.6 × 10−19 J and so the energy released in eV is ∆E ≃ 3.4 × 10−13 1.6 × 10−19 eV ≃ 2.1 × 10 6 eV ≃ 2.1 MeV. The rest mass of the electron is ≃ 0.5 MeV and so by comparison ∆E ∼ 4 electron masses. The deuteron contains one neutron and one proton and so 2 g of deuterium contains ∼ 6 × 1023 deuterons and 1g of deuterium contains roughly 3 × 1023 deuterons. Forming each deuteron by ﬁssion of a proton and a neutron releases about 2 MeV of energy and so the energy released in forming 1g of deuterium by ﬁssion is roughly (3 × 1023) × 2 ∼ 6 × 1023 MeV ∼ 6 × 1029 eV ∼ 6 × 1029 × 1.6 × 10−19 J ∼ 9.6 × 1010 J. By comparison, a 10 MW power station produces 10 × 106 Js−1 and so the time needed to produce 9.6 × 1010 J of energy is roughly 9.6 × 1010 J 10 × 106 Js−1 ∼ 9.6 × 10 3 s ∼ 2.7 hr. 8. (a) The relativistic momentum associated with a particle of rest mass m0 and velocity u is prel = m0γ(u)u and the non relativistic momentum is pnonrel = m0u. We require that prel − pnonrel pnonrel = 1 100 = γ(u) − 1 1 = γ(u) − 1 → γ(u) = 1 + 1 100 = 1.01 Hence γ2(u) = 1 1 − u2/c2 = 1.01 2 = 1.0201 → 1 − u 2/c 2 = 1 1.0201 → u 2/c 2 = 1 − 1 1.0201 = 0.0197 → u/c = 0.14. Since γ(u) > 1 and prel = γ(u)pnonrel then prel > pnonrel. (b) Since ∆E = 108J of energy are released, the mass equivalent of this is ∆E/c2 ≃ 108/ (3 × 108)2 kg = 0.111 × 10−8kg =1.11 × 10−9kg. (N.B. 108J ≡ 108/ (1.6 × 10−19) eV = 6.25 × 1026 eV). The fractional mass change in the chemical reaction in which 9 kg of water are produced is thus 1.11 × 10−9kg 9 kg = 0.123 × 10 −9 = 1.23 × 10 −10 and the percentage change is approximately 1.2 × 10−8 %. By comparison, the fractional change in mass in the nuclear ﬁssion reaction is (mp + mn − md) md = 3.8 × 10−30 kg 3.3433 × 10−27 kg = 1.13 × 10 −3 DM Gangardt School of Physics and Astronomy University of Birmingham Solutions to Example Sheet 2 and so the percentage change in mass in the nuclear reaction is 1.13 × 10 −3 × 10 2 ∼ 0.11 %. Hence whereas the percentage mass change in the nuclear reaction is 1.1 × 10 −1% whereas in a chemical reaction the percentage change in mass is 1.2 × 10−8 % i.e. the nuclear reaction produces a measurable mass change which is seven orders of magnitude larger than the unmeasurably small percentage change which occurs in a chemical reaction.
