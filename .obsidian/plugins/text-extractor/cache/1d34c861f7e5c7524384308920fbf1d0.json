WITH HONOURS FIRST-YEAR EXAMINATION 03 17483/20835 LC CHAOS IN NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS A/B SEMESTER 2 EXAMINATIONS 2022/23 Time Allowed: 1 hour Answer two questions. If you answer more than two questions, credit will only be given for the best two answers. The approximate allocation of marks to each part of a question is shown in brackets [ ]. All symbols have their usual meanings. Calculators may be used in this examination but must not be used to store text. Calculators with the ability to store text should have their memories deleted prior to the start of the examination. A formula sheet and a table of physical constants and units that may be required will be found at the end of this question paper. Page 1 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR Answer two questions. If you answer more than two questions, credit will only be given for the best two answers. 1. A weakly dissipative oscillator is described by the equation d2x dt2 + x = δ dx dt f [ x, dx dt ] (1) where δ ≪ 1. (a) Employ the position, x, and the momentum, p ≡ dx dt , to find the fundamental equation. [3] (b) Show that the energy E = 1 2 [(dx dt )2 + x2] (2) is conserved in the limit δ ↦→ 0 and determine how this energy changes, as a function of time, in the presence of the dissipation. [5] (c) Solve for the trajectory in the limit δ=0. [5] (d) Explain why the attractor must satisfy ∆E=0, where this change in energy is over a single period of the oscillation. [3] (e) For the particular case f [x, p] = 2 − x2 (3) find the attractor in the limit δ ↦→ 0. [9] A19919 Page 2 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 2. Consider the map xn+1 = r (xn − 1 xn ) (4) where r is a control parameter. (a) Find all the possible 1-cycles and establish for which range of control parameter they are stable. [8] (b) Find all the possible 2-cycles and establish for which range of control parameter they are stable. [13] (c) Find the attractor when it is either a 1-cycle or a 2-cycle.

(7) (a) Depict this map on the interval y ∈ [0, 1]. [3] (b) Depict the multiple maps M (2)[y] and M (3)[y] on the interval y ∈ [0, 1], where M (1)[y] ≡ M [y] and M (n+1)[y] ≡ M [M (n)[y]] . (8) [3] (c) Use these multiple maps to count the number of 1-cycles, 2-cycles, 3-cycles, 4-cycles, 5-cycles and 6-cycles for this map. [5] (d) Employ base 3 to find a useful representation for this map. [5] (e) Use base 3 to find all the possible 1-cycles, 2-cycles and 3-cycles. [6] (f) Find these cycles as fractions.
