The piece of 𝐴 in 𝐵 2. The piece of 𝐴 not in 𝐵 Mathematically this means 𝑃 𝐴 = 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 + 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵𝐶) Introduction to Probability For sets 𝐴 = 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 + |𝐴 ∩ 𝐵𝐶| Law of Total Probability If there is a sequence of disjoint sets 𝐵1, 𝐵2 … 𝐵𝑁 which “tile” 𝐴 then 𝑃 𝐴 = ෍ 𝑛=1 𝑁 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵𝑛) The distribution 𝑃 𝐴 is called the marginal distribution. Introduction to Probability Example If 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = 0.4 and 𝑃(𝐴 Introduction to Probability Total law: 𝑃 𝐴 = 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 + 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵𝐶 = 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6 Change of Notation Change of Notation From now on the union won’t play a large role Therefore 𝑃 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 → 𝑃(𝐴, 𝐵) This is called the joint distribution. Introduction to Probability Change of Notation (2) The previous equations are given by 𝑃 𝐴 = ෍ 𝑛=1 𝑁 𝑃(𝐴, 𝐵𝑛) 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 = 𝑃 𝐴, 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) 𝑃 𝐴, 𝐵 = P A P(B) Introduction to Probability Marginalising Conditional Probability Independence Example If the joint distribution 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) is given by the following What is 𝑃(𝑦)?

Introduction to Probability Using Bayes’ theorem 𝑃 𝐵|𝐴 = 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 𝑃(𝐴) = 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 + 𝑃 𝐴 ത𝐵 𝑃 ത𝐵 = 1 5 × 1 2 1 5 × 1 2 + 3 10 × 1 2 = 2 5 Example There are two boxes: 1. Box A has 5 gold coins and 5 silver. 2. Box B has 5 gold coins and 10 silver. If a box is picked at random, and a coin is then picked at random, what is the probability that the box chosen was A, given that the coin was silver? Introduction to Probability Let g be the event cold coin 𝑃 𝑔 𝐴 = 1 2 = 𝑃 ҧ𝑔 𝐴 𝑃 𝑔 𝐵 = 1 3 ; 𝑃 ҧ𝑔 𝐵 = 2 3 𝑃 𝐴 = 𝑃 𝐵 = 1 2 Then 𝑃 𝐴 ҧ𝑔 = 𝑃 ҧ𝑔 𝐴 𝑃(𝐴) 𝑃 ҧ𝑔 𝐴 𝑃 𝐴 + 𝑃 ҧ𝑔 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) = 1 2 1 2 + 2 3 = 3 7 Example You have two dice: One is a biased die is three times as likely to be even as odd. The other is fair. If you pick the die at random and throw an odd number, what is the probability you have the biased die? Introduction to Probability Let coin one (denoted c1) be biased. Then 1 = 3𝑝 + 9𝑝 → 𝑃 odd|c1 = 1 4 And 𝑃 odd|c2 = 1 2 𝑃 c1|odd = 𝑃 odd|c1 𝑃 𝑐1 𝑃 odd|c1 𝑃 𝑐1 + 𝑃 odd|c2 𝑃 𝑐2 = 1 4 1 4 + 1 2 = 1 3 Class Example Polygraphs are used to screen people. Each individual either tells the truth or lies. The (imperfect) polygraph returns 0 if it thinks the person is lying, or 1 for truthfulness, with the following probabilities: 𝑃 0 Lies = 0.88 𝑃 1 Truth = 0.86 People don’t lie commonly, approximately 1% of the time. What is the probability that the polygraph wrongly accuses someone of lying? Introduction to Probability We have P Lies = 0.01 so P Truth|0 = P 0|Truth 𝑃 Truth P 0|Truth 𝑃 Truth + P 0|Lies 𝑃 Lies = (1 − 0.86) × (1 − 0.01) (1 − 0.86) × (1 − 0.01) + 0.88 × 0.01 = 0.1386 0.1474 ≈ 0.94 Summary Law of Total Probability 𝑃 𝐴 = ෍ 𝐵 𝑃 𝐴, 𝐵 = ෍ 𝐵 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) Bayes’ Theorem 𝑃 𝐵|𝐴 = 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃 𝐵 𝑃(𝐴) = 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) σ𝐵 𝑃 𝐴 𝐵 𝑃(𝐵) Introduction to Probability Recap so far Introduction to Probability Recap Introduction to Probability Examples Example Given a part was defective from the following data, what is the probability it was manufactured by machine B?
