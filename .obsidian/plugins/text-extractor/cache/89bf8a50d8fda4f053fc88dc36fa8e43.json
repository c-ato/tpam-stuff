What is meant by the terms isothermal, isobaric, isochoric and adiabatic? [8] 2. 12 grams of 16O gas (molar mass of 32 amu) is expanded from its original volume of 2 litres at a ﬁxed temperature of 300 K. During this expansion, its pressure changes from 200 kPa to 100 kPa. Calculate (a) The work done by the gas; [6] (b) The heat added to the gas. [2] 3. Point charges of −2Q, Q, and q are ﬁxed at (x, y) coordinates (−a, 0), (a, 0), and (a, 2a) respectively. Derive the vector expression for the net electric force on the charge q. [8] 4. Derive an expression for the inductance of a solenoid of length l, radius R, and having n turns per unit length. (Hint: use Ampere’s law and a sensible integration path to ﬁnd the B-ﬁeld and hence ﬂux inside the solenoid for a given current. Then use the correct expression from the formula sheet.)

(b) With switches S open, calculate the readings at the ammeter in the two circuits and explain the comparison between the results. (c) With switches S closed, calculate again the ammeter readings in the two circuits. Why are the currents different with respect to the previous case? Also, in which of these circuits with closed switches is the greatest power dissipated? [8] A22259 Page 3 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR SECTION 2 Answer all three questions in this Section.

EITHER Part A (a) Sketch the approximate form of the potential felt by an atom that is bound to another atom as a function of the interatomic distance. On this sketch, label both ϵ, the work done to separate the two atoms to inﬁnity, and r0, the equilibrium bond length between the two atoms. [5] (b) Now, instead sketch the force described by this potential as a function of interatomic distance, indicating where this force is attractive and repulsive, with r0 clearly labelled. [3] (c) The general form of the Lennard-Jones potential is given by V (r) = A r12 − B r6 . Show that the generalised constants A and B can be related to ϵ and r0, with A = ϵr12 0 and B = 2ϵr6 0. [5] (d) A student puts some liquid argon, which has density ρ and surface tension γ, into a refrigerated tank with a small tube of radius r protruding vertically out of it. The liquid rises into the tube to a height h and forms a meniscus, with a contact angle θ between surface of the liquid and the wall of the tube. Derive an expression for the height the liquid reaches in the tube. You may assume the liquid undergoes an acceleration due to gravity of g m s −2. [7] A22259 Page 4 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR Part B (a) State the law of the equipartition of energy. [3] (b) Use this law to predict and justify the molar heat capacity at constant volume, cV , in terms of the gas constant R, for i. a monatomic gas; [2] ii. a diatomic gas; [3] iii. a solid comprised of atoms in a lattice. [3] (c) Oxygen gas (O2) and chlorine gas (Cl2) are experimentally found to have cV = 20.7 J K−1 mol−1 and cV = 24.8 J K−1 mol−1 respectively. What is the reason for this difference? [3] (d) For a set of particles of mass m at a temperature T , the distribution of their speeds v is given by the normalised Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution P (v) = 4π ( m 2πkBT ) 3 2 v2 exp (−mv2 2kBT ) i. Show that the most probable speed is √ 2kBT /m. [3] ii. Through use of the law of the equipartition of energy, justify that the root-mean square speed is given by √3kBT /m. [3] A22259 Page 5 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 7. EITHER Part A (a) An inﬁnite long wire with a uniform charge density, λ, along its length is placed along the z-axis. By choosing a suitable Gaussian surface, use Gauss’ Law to ﬁnd an expression for the electric ﬁeld at a distance r from this wire along the y-axis. [5] (b) An inﬁnite number of such inﬁnite long wires, each identical to the one described in part (a), are placed in the x-z plane, as shown in the ﬁgure below. All the wires are parallel to the z-axis and equally spaced so that there are N wires per unit length along the x direction. Use the superposition principle in combination with the result from (a) to derive an expression for the electric ﬁeld at a point, with distance d from the origin, along the y-axis [10] You may ﬁnd the follow sum useful: ∞∑ n=−∞ 1 a2 + n2 = π coth (πa) a , where a is any constant. (c) Show that when d is much greater than the wire spacing, your result from part (b) approximates to the electric ﬁeld from an inﬁnite charged plane with charge per unit area, σ. [5] A22259 Page 6 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR OR Part B (a) A uniform current density, J ﬂows through an inﬁnitely long wire of radius R. Use Ampere’s Law to derive expressions (in terms of J , R, r, and any constants) for the magnetic ﬁeld: i. outside the wire at a distance r > R; [3] ii. inside the wire at distance r < R. [4] (b) Describe (or make a sketch showing) the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld outside the wire mentioned in part (a) above. [3] (c) The ﬁgure below shows the cross-section of an inﬁnitely long conducting cylinder of radius 3a carrying a current density of J in the positive z direction (coming out of the page). Inside the cylinder is an inﬁnitely long cylindrical hole of radius a, which is displaced so that its centre is at a distance a from the centre of the the conducting cylinder (obviously, no current ﬂows inside the hole). Derive a vector expression for the magnitude and direction of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the hole. (Hint: use the superposition principle and remember the magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to both the current density and radial vector i.e. B ∝ J ∧ r.) [10] A22259 Page 7 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR 8.

[5] (b) Open the switch S1 and ﬁnd an expression for the current as a function of time (neglect the transient). [3] (c) Now open both switches S1 and S2, at which frequency the current is in phase with the voltage? For this frequency, calculate the total impedance of the circuit. Then calculate the maximum energy stored in the capacitor during the oscillations. [8] (d) Consider now the circuit below: obtain its series equivalent such that theR LV=V0 sin(t) A22259 Page 8 TURN OVER ANY CALCULATOR series circuit draws the same current and power at a given voltage and frequency ω.
