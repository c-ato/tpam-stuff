This is shown below. The combination of resistors is 1 + 9 6 = 1 + 3 2 = 2.5 Ω . The Thévenin voltage is VAB. This can be calculated as shown in the circuit below, V AB = 6 V 2 = 3 V . The load resistances to the right of the original AB line can be sketched as shown below. This combination gives two branches of 10 Ω, yielding 5 Ω. The current through the combined load resistor is I = V R = 3 7.5 = 0.4 A . The 5 Ω resistor is actually two branches of 10 Ω, so the current through each branch is half the total, i.e. 0.2 A. 6 V 3 Ω A B 3 Ω 10 Ω 1 Ω 4 Ω 6 Ω 3 Ω A B 3 Ω 1 Ω 3 Ω A B 1 Ω 3 Ω Can be redrawn 3 Ω A B 3 Ω 1 Ω 6 V No current Current flow 4 Ω A B 10 Ω 6 Ω Can be redrawn A B 10 Ω 4 Ω 6 Ω 6 V A B 5 Ω 2.5 Ω","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
