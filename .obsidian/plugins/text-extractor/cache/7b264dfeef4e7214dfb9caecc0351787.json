Q2: At any given time, what proportion of molecules in the atmosphere have a height greater than 8 km? Q3: Averaged over a long timescale, what fraction of the time does a particular molecule spend at an altitude > 8 km? Identical questions!

A: ~ 0.04 Boltzmann factors Remember that the quantity 𝑚𝑔ℎ 𝑘𝐵𝑇 must be dimensionless… what physically does it mean? 𝑚𝑔ℎ = (gravitational) potential energy 𝑘𝐵𝑇 = thermal energy 𝑃𝑟 ℎ = 𝐴𝜌𝑁(ℎ) 𝑁 = 𝑚𝑔 𝑘𝐵𝑇 ⅇ− 𝑚𝑔ℎ 𝑘𝐵𝑇 𝑃𝑟 ℎ ∝ ⅇ− 𝐸 𝑘𝐵𝑇 This is the Boltzmann factor – gives the probability of measuring a certain energy state at a given temperature","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
