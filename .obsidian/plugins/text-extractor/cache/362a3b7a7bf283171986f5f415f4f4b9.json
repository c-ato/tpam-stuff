Recap from last timeThermodynamic transitions Isothermal (fixed temperature): No change in temperature so no change in internal energy Δ𝑇 = Δ𝑈 = 0 In PV plane, 𝑃𝑉 = constant 0 = 𝑄𝑖𝑛 + 𝑊onPressure VolumePressure Temperature TemperatureVolume Thermodynamic transitions Isochoric (fixed volume): As 𝑊on = − ׬ 𝑃 ⅆ𝑉 and ⅆ𝑉 = 0, 𝑊on = 0 Δ𝑈 = 𝑄𝑖𝑛Pressure VolumePressure Temperature TemperatureVolume Thermodynamic transitions Isobaric (fixed pressure): No non-zero terms here, but… 𝑊on = − ׬ 𝑃 ⅆ𝑉 = (−)𝑃 Δ𝑉 Pressure VolumePressure Temperature TemperatureVolume Δ𝑈 = 𝑄𝑖𝑛 + 𝑃 Δ𝑉 Heat capacities of (ideal) gases Recall that Δ𝑄 = 𝐶Δ𝑇 → 𝐶 = ⅆ𝑄 ⅆ𝑇 … for gas, need more careful treatment Molar heat capacity: 𝐶 = 𝑛𝑐 At a constant volume: 𝐶𝑉 = ⅆ𝑄𝑖𝑛 ⅆ𝑇 𝑉 At a constant pressure: 𝐶𝑃 = ⅆ𝑄𝑖𝑛 ⅆ𝑇 𝑃 Mayer’s relation: 𝐶𝑃 = 𝐶𝑉 + 𝑛𝑅 Thus it is clear that 𝐶𝑃 < 𝐶𝑉 Volume, V Molar heat capacity data (1 mole at 298 K) Gas CV (J mol-1 K-1) CP (J mol-1 K-1) CP – CV (J mol-1 K-1) Helium (He) 12.52 20.79 8.27 Argon (Ar) 12.45 20.79 8.34 Krypton (Kr) 12.45 20.79 8.34 Xenon (Xe) 12.52 20.79 8.27 Hydrogen (H2) 20.42 28.74 8.32 Nitrogen (N2) 20.76 29.07 8.31 Oxygen (O2) 20.85 29.16 8.31 Carbon monoxide (CO) 20.85 29.16 8.31 Remember that 𝑅 = 8.31 J K-1 Monatomic gases give CP = 5R/2, CV = 3R/2 Diatomic gases give CP = 7R/2, CV = 5R/2 Law of equipartition (much later… probably week 10) Thermodynamic transitions Adiabatic (no heat transfer): No heat transfer, so 𝑄𝑖𝑛 = 0Pressure Volume TemperatureVolumeSteeper Less steep In the PV plane, adiabatic processes appear steeper than isothermal processes Adiabatic processes are steeper in the PV plane than in the VT plane Δ𝑈 = 𝑊on In PV plane, adiabatic processes are described by 𝑃𝑉𝛾 = constant In VT plane, adiabatic processes are described by T𝑉𝛾−1 = constant First law example question 1 gram of water (volume = 1 cm3) is boiled at a fixed temperature and atmospheric pressure (1.01 x 102 kPa) and turns into 1671 cm3 of steam. The latent heat of vaporisation of water is 2.26 MJ/kg Calculate: i) the work done by the water/steam = 167 J ii) the change in internal energy of the water/steam = 2093 J PV diagrams We can move through the PV plane through processes, which usually involve some heat transfer and work (like in the case on the left) If we go along the blue path, is the change in internal energy 𝑈𝐴𝐵 1) Larger than if we went via the red path? 2) smaller than if we went via the red path? 3) The same as if we went via the red path? As internal energy is a function of state it does not matter which path we take… U depends on solely on T, which itself depends on P and V (for same P and V, same T and hence same U)Pressure Volume A B PV diagrams We can move through the PV plane through processes, which usually involve some heat transfer and work (like in the case on the left) Is the work done by the gas, Wby, 1) Greater for the red path? 2) Greater for the blue path? 3) The same for both paths?
