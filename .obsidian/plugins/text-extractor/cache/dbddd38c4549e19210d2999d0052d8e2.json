Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. No calculator is permitted in this examination. Page 1 Turn over No Calculator Section A 1. (a) (i) Define what it means for a sequence of real numbers (an) to converge to a real number ℓ. (ii) Using the definition above, prove that the sequence (an) given by an = n2 + 2n + 1 2n2 + 3n − 1 converges to 1 2 . [6] (b) (i) Define what it means for a sequence of real numbers (an) to tend to infinity. (ii) Using the definition above, prove that the sequence (an) given by an = 2n2 + n + 1 3n + 1 tends to infinity. [5] (c) Establish which of the series below converge, justifying your assertions. (i) ∞ ∑ n=1 2n 3n . (ii) ∞ ∑ n=1 (2n)! 3n(n!)2 . (iii) ∞ ∑ n=1 (−1)n+1 √ n . (iv) ∞ ∑ n=1 2n + (−1)n n3 + 2 . (v) ∞ ∑ n=1 ( 1 + 1 n )n . In this question you may appeal to standard results on the convergence of sequences and series, provided you make it clear that you are doing so. [14] A34927 Page 2 Turn over No Calculator Section B In this section you may appeal to standard results on the convergence of sequences and series, provided you make it clear when you do so. 2. (a) A sequence of nonnegative real numbers (an) is defined recursively by the formula an+1 = 2 + an 3 + an , where a1 = 1. (i) Prove that an+2 − an+1 = an+1 − an (3 + an)(3 + an+1) for all n ∈ N. (ii) Use induction to show that (an) is decreasing. (iii) Show that (an) converges, and find its limit, carefully justifying any assertions that you make. (iv) Show further that an+1 − an ≤ 1 4 (1 9 )n−1 for all n ∈ N. [12] (b) (i) Define what it means for a series of real numbers ∞ ∑ n=1 an to converge. (ii) Use the definition to show that the series ∞ ∑ n=1 1 n2 − 1 4 converges, and find its sum. [6] (c) Suppose (an) is a sequence of real numbers such that |an|1/n → 1. Prove that the series ∞ ∑ n=1 anxn converges whenever |x| < 1.

Important Reminders • Coats and outer-wear should be placed in the designated area. • Unauthorised materials (e.g. notes or Tippex) MUST be placed in the des- ignated area. • Check that you DO NOT have any unauthorised materials with you (e.g. in your pockets, pencil case). • Mobile phones and smart watches MUST be switched off and placed in the designated area or under your desk. They must not be left on your person or in your pockets. • You are NOT permitted to use a mobile phone as a clock. If you have difficulty in seeing a clock, please alert an Invigilator. • You are NOT permitted to have writing on your hand, arm or other body part. • Check that you do not have writing on your hand, arm or other body part – if you do, you must inform an Invigilator immediately. • Alert an Invigilator immediately if you find any unauthorised item upon you during the examination. Any students found with non-permitted items upon their person during the examination, or who fail to comply with Examination rules may be subject to the Student Conduct procedures.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
