Consider the equation d2ρ dt2 = √π ∫ m A2 dv, where ρ, t, m, A and v are density, time, mass, area and speed respectively. (a) What are the dimensions of ρ, t, m, A and v? [4] (b) Is the equation dimensionally homogeneous? Justify your answer. [3] 2. At time t = 0, a projectile of mass m is launched from the origin at an angle α to the horizontal with speed U . (a) Let the position vector of the projectile be r = xi + zk. Neglecting air resistance, use Newton’s second law to show that x = U t cos α and z = − 1 2 gt 2 + U t sin α. [6] Hence determine an expression for the speed v of the projectile at time t. [2] (b) Hence determine an expression for the kinetic energy of the projectile in terms of the time t. [1] 3. Consider a star located at the origin of a coordinate system. A planet orbiting the star has polar coordinates (r, θ) where r is a constant. What is the shape of the orbit? If dθ dt = ω where ω is constant, write down an expression for the speed of the planet in terms of r and ω. [4] SECTION B 4. You may ﬁnd the following formulae useful in this question: er = cos θi + sin θj ? Turn over - 3 - Any Calculator eθ = − sin θi + cos θj. Consider a particle with mass m and polar coordinates (r, θ), where r and θ are functions of time t. The particle has position vector r = rer. (a) Determine expressions in terms of er and eθ for the velocity v and the acceleration a of the particle. [4] (b) The particle experiences a central force F = −F (r) er. Write down Newton’s second law for the motion of the particle. [1] (c) Prove that r2 ˙θ is constant, where ˙θ = dθ/dt. [2] (d) Prove that d2u dθ2 + u = F (1/u) mh2u2 , where u = 1/r and h = r2 ˙θ. [6] (e) Determine the general solution to the diﬀerential equation in (d) when F (r) = 1/r2. In this case, if the resulting orbit is circular, determine the radius of the orbit.
