Contents and Philosophy • Although Newton’s three laws of motion are very familiar to us, and may appear simple, they can lead to surprising results even in everyday situations. • In this course we will demonstrate how to model simple physical systems using Newton’s laws. • The physical situations we shall analyse are: • Kinematics of projectiles. • Statics of rigid bodies in equilibrium. • Hydrostatic equilibrium in fluids. • Laminar flow in a Newtonian fluid. Newtonian Mechanics • Newton’s three laws of motion are: N1: A body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless a force acts on it. N2: The rate of change of momentum of a body equals the total force acting upon it. N3: Any two bodies exert equal and opposite forces upon each other (along the line joining their centres). • In mathematical shorthand: N1: F = 0 → ˙v = 0 N2: F = ˙p constant mass → F = ma N3: F AB = −F BA (and F AB × rAB = 0 ) Projectiles • Consider a particle of mass m in a constant gravitational field g = −gj, with no air resistance or wind. Newton’s second law gives ma = F = mg, which in component form is ¨x = 0, ¨y = −g. • If the particle is projected from a point with speed v at angle θ to the horizontal, then we have initial conditions x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0, ˙x(0) = v cos θ, ˙y(0) = v sin θ. • Integrating the eqns of motion gives ˙x = c1 and ˙y = −gt + c2. The initial conditions give c1 = v cos θ and c2 = v sin θ, so that ˙x = v cos θ, ˙y = v sin θ − gt. • Integrating again gives x = vt cos θ + c3, y = vt sin θ − 1 2 gt 2 + c4. • The initial conditions give c3 = c4 = 0, so that x = vt cos θ, y = vt sin θ − 1 2 gt 2. • To find the shape of the trajectory, eliminate t by writing t = x/v cos θ, and substituting into the equation for y, y = v sin θ [ x v cos θ ] − 1 2 g [ x v cos θ ]2 = x tan θ − gx2 2v2 cos2 θ . • This is a parabola with endpoints at y = 0 so that x = 0 or x = 2v2 cos2 θ g tan θ = 2v2 g sin θ cos θ = v2 g sin 2θ. • The maximum range of the projectile occurs when θ = π/4, xmax = v2 g . • The total time the projectile is in the air is given by y = vt sin θ − 1 2 gt 2 = 0 → t = 2v sin θ g . • Consider now the range of a projectile on an inclined plane at angle β to the horizontal, whose equation is y = x tan β. • We first find the time the projectile is in flight by substituting the x(t) and y(t) equations into y = x tan β, vt cos θ tan β = vt sin θ − 1 2 gt 2 → v cos θ tan β = v sin θ − 1 2 gt → t = 2v g [ sin θ − cos θ tan β]. • The range is therefore x = vt cos θ = 2v2 g [ sin θ cos θ − cos2 θ tan β] . • The range along the plane is found by multiplying by sec β. • To find the maximum range, dx dθ = 0 → cos2 θ − sin 2 θ + 2 tan β sin θ cos θ = 0 → cos 2θ = − tan β sin 2θ → cot 2θ = − tan β. • Since cot α = tan (π/2 − α), it follows that π 2 − 2θ = −β → θ = π 4 + β 2 . • The maximum range is then x = v2 g [ sin 2θ − tan β(1 + cos 2θ) ] = v2 g [ cos β − tan β(1 − sin β) ] = v2 g cos2 β − sin β + sin2 β cos β = v2 g [ sec β − tan β]. Summary of Lecture 1 • Projectile with initial speed v at angle θ under constant gravity. • x = vt cos θ; y = vt sin θ − 1 2 gt 2; y = x tan θ − g 2v2 cos2 θ x2. • Trajectory is a parabola • If the projectile is fired on a plane inclined at an angle β to the horizontal, the time in the air and the range are given by t = 2v g [ sin θ − cos θ tan β], x = vt cos θ = 2v2 g [ sin θ cos θ − cos2 θ tan β]. • The range is maximised when θ = π 4 + β 2 , giving the value xmax = v2 g [ sec β − tan β]. Projectile on Inclined Plane: Rotated Axes • A more sophisticated way to solve the problem is to use rotated axes: • The initial velocity and acceleration in the y′-direction are v sin (θ − β) and −g cos β, respectively, so that ˙y′ = v sin (θ − β) − gt cos β y′ = vt sin (θ − β) − 1 2 gt 2 cos β • The initial velocity and acceleration in the x′-direction are v cos (θ − β) and −g sin β, respectively, so that ˙x′ = v cos (θ − β) − gt sin β x′ = vt cos (θ − β) − 1 2 gt 2 sin β • The time the projectile is in the air is found by setting y′ = 0 to give t = 2v g sin (θ − β) cos β = 2v g [ sin θ cos β − cos θ sin β cos β ] = 2v g [ sin θ − cos θ tan β] as before. • Substituting into the equation for x′ then gives x′ = vt cos (θ − β) − 1 2 gt 2 sin β = 2v sin (θ − β) g cos β [v cos (θ − β) − 1 2 g sin β 2v sin (θ − β) g cos β ] • Using double angle formulae, this becomes x′ = v2 g cos β ( sin 2(θ − β) − tan β[1 − cos 2(θ − β)]) • To find the maximum range, dx′ dθ = 0 → cos 2(θ − β) − tan β sin 2(θ − β) = 0 → tan 2(θ − β) = cot β → 2θ − 2β = π 2 − β → θ = π 4 + β 2 as before. • The coordinates of a point in the xy- and x′y′-frame are related by x′ = x cos β + y sin β ↔ x = x′ cos β − y′ sin β y′ = y cos β − x sin β ↔ y = y′ cos β + x′ sin β • Interesting fact: the initial and final velocities are perpendicular for the maximum range trajectory where θ = π 4 + β 2 . • To see this, consider the velocity in the x′y′-frame at time t, v′(t) = [ ˙x′(t) ˙y′(t) ] = [ v cos (θ − β) − gt sin β v sin (θ − β) − gt cos β ] . • It follows that v′ i = v [cos (θ − β) sin (θ − β) ] and v′ f = v [cos (θ − β) − 2 tan β sin (θ − β) − sin (θ − β) ] . • Taking the scalar product between these vectors gives v′ i · v′ f = v2[ − sin 2 (θ − β) + cos2 (θ − β) − 2 tan β sin (θ − β) cos (θ − β)] = v2[ cos 2(θ − β) − tan β sin 2(θ − β)] = 0. The Enveloping Parabola • If a projectile is launched from the origin, O, with speed, v, what region of the xy-plane can it access? • We know that if it is projected at angle θ, its trajectory is given by y = x tan θ − gx2 2v2 cos2 θ . • If we define T = tan θ and a = v2/g, we may rewrite this as y = xT − x2 2a (1 + T 2) → T 2 − 2a x T + 1 + 2ay x2 = 0. • Solving this quadratic to find T = tan θ gives T = 1 2 [ 2a x ± √ 4a2 x2 − 4 − 8ay x2 ] = a ± √ a2 − x2 − 2ay x . • The accessible region corresponds to T having two distinct real roots; the inaccessible region to T having complex roots. • The boundary of the accessible region thus occurs when T has a repeated real root i.e. the discriminant is zero a 2 − x2 − 2ay = 0 → y = a2 − x2 2a . • This curve is known as the enveloping parabola. Summary of Lecture 2 • For a projectile fired at an angle to the horizontal on to an inclined slope, the initial and final velocities are perpendicular for the maximum range trajectory. • If a projectile is launched from origin, O, with speed, v, it can reach the region of the xy-plane bounded by the enveloping parabola, 2ay = a2 − x2, where a = v2/g. • A projectile will pass through a point (x, y) in this region if fired at angle θ given by tan θ = a ± √ a2 − x2 − 2ay x . Statics Statics is the branch of mechanics concerned with bodies at rest and forces in equilibrium. • From Newton’s second law, F = ma, then since a = 0, the total external force on any object must be zero. • The types of force we will be considering include: • Tension T : The pulling force transmitted along a string, cable, chain or similar one-dimensional continuous object, or by each end of a rod or similar three-dimensional object. • Normal Force N : The force perpendicular to a surface that the surface applies to an object. • Friction F : The force parallel to a surface that the surface applies to an object. • Gravity Fg: The force of attraction between two massive bodies. If the masses are m1 and m2, and they are a distance r apart, the force has magnitude Fg = Gm1m2/r2. • Tension may be regarded as the action-reaction pair of forces acting at the end of each element of the continuous object. • There are two types of frictional force: • Static Friction: When the two bodies are at rest relative to each other, Ff ≤ µsN , where µs is the static coefficient of friction. • Dynamic Friction: When the two bodies are moving relative to each other, Ff = µkN where µk is the dynamic coefficient of friction. µk is usually less than µs for the same pair of materials. • If m is the mass of an object, M the mass of the Earth, and R the radius of the Earth, then the gravitational force is Fg = GM m R2 = mg where g = GM R2 . Block on Slope • Consider a block of mass, M , on a slope of angle, θ, with a horizontal force, F , applied. For which values of θ is the frictional force, Ff , large enough to keep the block at rest? • Resolve forces up the slope, and perpendicular to the slope: ∥ forces : Ff − M g sin θ + F cos θ = 0 → Ff = M g sin θ − F cos θ ⊥ forces : N − M g cos θ − F sin θ = 0 → N = M g cos θ + F sin θ • For static equilibrium we require |Ff | ≤ µN , so that −µM g cos θ−µF sin θ ≤ M g sin θ−F cos θ ≤ µM g cos θ+µF sin θ • The first inequality can be rearranged to give (F − µM g) cos θ ≤ (µF + M g) sin θ → F − µM g µF + M g ≤ tan θ • The second inequality can be rearranged to give (M g − µF ) sin θ ≤ (µM g + F ) cos θ → tan θ ≤ µM g + F M g − µF • The range of possible angles is thus given by F − µM g µF + M g ≤ tan θ ≤ µM g + F M g − µF • With no applied force this gives the result −θ0 ≤ θ ≤ θ0 where the angle of friction, θ0 is given by tan θ0 = µ. • µ is typically in the range 0.3 − 0.6, but can be as low as 0.04 for Teflon on Teflon, and greater than 1 for rubber on rubber. Torques • In addition to balancing forces for a static problem, we also need to balance torques (also known as moments). • Consider three forces applied to a rod as shown above. For the total force to add up to zero we need F1 + F2 = F3. • Thinking of the rod as a seesaw, we know that there is a further relation, F2(a + b) = F3a. • In other words, the torque (moment) – force times distance – around the left hand point must cancel. • In fact the torque around any point must equal zero. • If the forces are not perpendicular to the rod, it is only the perpendicular components that contribute to the torque. • In the figure above, the equation for torque balance around the point where F3 acts is F1a sin θ1 = F2b sin θ2. • In vector terms, the torque is defined by τ = r × F if the force F acts at a vector position r relative to the point about which torques are being evaluated. Summary of Lecture 3 • Statics is the branch of mechanics concerned with bodies at rest. The sum of forces on each body at rest must be zero. • The common forces encountered in statics are: • Tension in a string, cable, chain or rod. • Normal force exerted on a body by the surface it sits on. • Frictional force exerted when a body moves across a surface. • Gravity – usually constant and exerted by the Earth. • For rigid bodies, the sum of torques, τ = r × F , around any point must also add to zero. Aside: Newton’s Laws for Rigid Bodies • Consider a rigid body that is made up of N particles of mass mi at vector positions ri. Newton’s law for the i-th particle is mi d2ri dt2 = F tot i = F ext i + ∑ j̸=i Fij. • We have split the total force on the i-th particle, F tot i , into the external force, F ext i , plus the sum of the internal forces – Fij is the force on the i-th particle due to the j-th particle. • Our goal is to get rid of the internal forces, Fij. • If we add up the equations for the N particles we get N∑ i=1 mi d2ri dt2 = N∑ i=1 F ext i + N∑ i=1 ∑ j̸=i Fij. • In the double sum over Fij, there are N (N − 1) terms, which can be written as a sum over the N (N − 1)/2 distinct pairs ij, N∑ i=1 ∑ j̸=i Fij = N∑ i=1 N∑ j>i (Fij + Fji) = 0 (Newton’s third law) • Defining the centre of mass, R, by N∑ i=1 miri = [ N∑ i=1 mi ] R = M R → M d2R dt2 = F ext. • In other words, the rigid body behaves as if it were a particle of mass, M , and position, R, subject only to external forces. • In the static case this means that the sum of the external forces on the rigid body must be zero. • We still have to consider the angular motion of the rigid body about its centre of mass. • In the following we will need the result dLi dt = d dt [ri × mi dri dt ] = [ dri dt × mi dri dt ] + [ri × mi d2ri dt2 ] = ri × mi d2ri dt2 . • If we take the cross product of Newton’s second law for the i-th particle with ri we get dLi dt = ri × mi d2ri dt2 = ri × F tot i = ri × F ext i + ∑ j̸=i ri × Fij • Adding up the equations for the N particles then gives N∑ i=1 dLi dt = N∑ i=1 τ ext i + N∑ i=1 ∑ j̸=i ri × Fij. • Converting the double sum to a sum over pairs, then ij yields ri × Fij + rj × Fji = (ri − rj) × Fij = 0, where we have used the strong form of Newton’s third law – Fji = −Fij and parallel to ri − rj. • The linear and angular equations of motion for the rigid body may therefore be written as dP dt = F ext and dL dt = τ ext. • P and L are the total momentum and angular momentum of the body, respectively, P = ∑ i mivi and L = ∑ i ri × mivi. • F ext and τ ext are the total external force and external torque acting on the body, respectively. • In a static situation, P and L are both zero, so the external forces and torques on the body must both add up to zero. • The gravitational force acts at the centre of mass since τ ext = ∑ i ri × F ext i = ∑ i miri × g = R × M g. Summary of Lecture 4 • The linear and angular equations of motion for a rigid body are dP dt = F ext and dL dt = τ ext. • P and L are the total momentum and angular momentum of the body, respectively, P = ∑ i mivi and L = ∑ i ri × mivi. • F ext and τ ext are the total external force and external torque acting on the body, respectively. • In the static case, this means that the sum of external forces and external torques must equal zero on any rigid body. The Leaning Ladder • A ladder of mass m and length ℓ leans against a frictionless wall. If the ground has coefficient of friction µ, what is the smallest angle θ it can make with the ground and not slip? • We balance horizontal and vertical forces, and torques about the bottom of the ladder, F tot x = 0 → N2 = F F tot y = 0 → N1 = mg τ tot = 0 → 1 2 mgℓ cos θ = N2ℓ sin θ • Hence F = N2 = 1 2 mg cot θ and N1 = mg. • Since F ≤ µN1, it follows that cot θ ≤ 2µ, so that the minimum angle is given by tan θ = 1/2µ. • If the ladder is at the limit of stability, is it safe for a man of mass M to stand on the bottom rung of the ladder, a distance d from the bottom of the ladder? • Balancing forces and torques then gives F tot x = 0 → N2 = F F tot y = 0 → N1 = (m + M )g τ tot = 0 → 1 2 mgℓ cos θ + M gd cos θ = N2ℓ sin θ • Hence, noting that cot θ = 2µ at the limit of stability, F = N2 = ( 1 2 m + d ℓ M ) g cot θ = µmg + 2d ℓ µM g. • For stability we need F ≤ µN1 = µmg + µM g, which will be the case if d ≤ ℓ/2. • This explains why someone standing on the bottom rung of a ladder makes it more stable. Just don’t go past half-way up the ladder... The Capstan Equation • The capstan equation relates the hold-force to the load-force if a rope is wound around a cylinder (capstan). • The balance of the frictional forces and tension means that the tension in the rope wound around the capstan may be different on either side of the capstan. • A small holding force on one side can carry a much larger loading force on the other side. • To derive the capstan equation, consider the force balance on an infinitesimal piece of rope of angular extent dθ. • Resolving tangential forces, we see that the change in tension from T (θ) to T (θ + dθ) is balanced by the frictional force, dF , dF = T (θ + dθ) − T (θ) = dT dθ dθ. • Resolving perpendicular forces, we see that the normal force is balanced by the tension forces, dN = 2 T (θ) sin(dθ/2) = T dθ. • Assuming the frictional force has its maximum value, dF = µ dN → dT dθ = µ T → T (θ) = T (0) e µθ. • It follows that if the winding angle of the rope is θ, the maximum load that can be supported is given by Tload = Thold eµθ. • For µ = 0.3, three turns of the rope – θ = 6π – gives a factor of 286 between load and hold forces. • In rock-climbing, if a climber is top-roped, a lighter person may belay them due to this effect – and thus be able to support their weight if they fall. A Rope Between Two Slopes • A rope is draped between two planes with coefficient of friction µ = 1. Both planes are at the same angle, θ, and the rope has uniform density ρ. Can this be a static situation? • Suppose that the length of rope in contact with the slope is x, and the total length of the rope is 2ℓ. • Balancing the normal force with the perpendicular component of the gravitational force acting on the length of rope in contact with the slope gives N = ρgx cos θ. • The frictional force therefore satisfies Ff ≤ ρgx cos θ. • Balancing the vertical components of the normal force and friction against the gravitational force acting on the rope of length ℓ gives N cos θ + F sin θ = ρgℓ. • At the point of instability, F = µN = N = ρgx cos θ, so that ρgx cos θ[ cos θ + sin θ] = ρgℓ → x = ℓ cos2 θ + cos θ sin θ . • To find the smallest x for which the rope can be static, d dθ [ cos2 θ + cos θ sin θ] = −2 sin θ cos θ + cos2 θ − sin 2 θ = − sin 2θ + cos 2θ = 0, from which it follows that tan 2θ = 1 and hence θ = π/8. • The minimum value of x is therefore, x = 2ℓ 1 + cos 2θ + sin 2θ = 2ℓ 1 + √2 . • The maximum fraction of the rope that can be free-hanging is f = ℓ − x ℓ = √2 − 1 √2 + 1 = (√2 − 1 )2 = 3 − 2 √2 ∼ 0.172. • The maximum value of the angle θ will occur when x = ℓ which gives cos 2θ + sin 2θ = 1 → √2 sin (2θ + π/4) = 1 → 2θ + π/4 = π/4, 3π/4 → θ = π/4. Summary of Lecture 5 • For a ladder leaning against a smooth wall and on a floor with coefficient of friction, µ, the minimum angle to the ground is given by tan θ = 1/2µ. • The Capstan Equation: • Rope wrapped around a cylinder with coefficient of friction µ. • Find tension varies in rope according to T (θ) = T0eµθ. • A small hold force can balance a much larger load force. • A Rope Between Two Slopes: • A rope of length 2ℓ and density ρ resting on slopes of angle θ with coefficient of friction µ = 1. • The length of rope in contact with each slope is then given by x = 2ℓ/(1 + cos 2θ + sin 2θ); minimum value when θ = π/8. The Hanging Chain • Consider a chain of uniform mass per unit length, ρ, which is supported at both ends, and hanging under gravity. What curve, y(x), does it form? • To find y(x), consider the forces acting on the segment of chain of arc length, s, starting at the lowest point where (x, y) = (0, 0), and ending at (x(s), y(s)). • The forces acting on this length of chain are the tensions, T0 and T at the two ends, and the gravitational force, −ρgsj. • Balancing forces in the horizontal and vertical directions gives T cos θ = T0 and T sin θ = ρgs → tan θ = ρgs T0 = s a . • Since dy dx = tan θ, and ds dx = √ 1 + ( dy dx )2, it follows that ds dx = √s2 + a2 a → ds √ s2 + a2 = dx a → sinh −1 ( s a ) = x a → s = a sinh ( x a ) → dy dx = sinh ( x a ) → y = a cosh ( x a ). • If a chain of length s hangs from points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) then y2 − y1 = a cosh ( x2 a ) − a cosh ( x1 a ), s = a sinh ( x2 a ) − a sinh ( x1 a ). • It follows that s 2−(y2−y1) 2 = 2a 2 [cosh ( x2 − x1 a ) − 1] = 4a 2 sinh 2 ( x2 − x1 2a ). • It follows that the a parameter can be found by solving the transcendental equation √ s2 − (y2 − y1)2 = 2a sinh ( x2 − x1 2a ) • The actual curve has offsets, x0 and y0, and is given by y − y0 = a cosh ( x − x0 a ) . • Once a has been determined, we can find x0 and y0 by adding and subtracting the equations relating x1 to y1 and x2 to y2. Cotton Reel • A cotton reel has an axle of radius r and outer radius R. A thread is wrapped around the axle and pulled with angle θ to horizontal. What is the allowable θ so the reel doesn’t move? • Balancing horizontal forces gives F = T cos θ. • Balancing torques around centre of the reel gives F R = T r. • It follows that cos θ = r/R. This is just the angle so that the tension meets the ground at the same point as the normal, frictional and gravitational forces. Truss Bridge • Consider the above truss bridge made from 3 equilateral triangles. All 7 beams are assumed massless. • Vertical forces at C: 2T3 sin 60◦ = mg → T3 = mg/ √3. • Vertical forces at B: T1 sin 60◦ = T3 sin 60◦ → T1 = T3. • Horizontal forces at B: T4 = (T1 + T3) cos 60◦ → T4 = T3. • If we assume the normal force at A is purely vertical, then the horizontal force balance at A gives T2 = T1 cos 60◦ = T1/2. • We see that the forces in all the truss elements are equal to T = mg/ √3, except the forces in the bottom elements, which equal T /2. • This method of solving the problem is the method of joints. • This type of truss is a Warren truss. There are various other types of trusses. Summary of Lecture 6 • The Hanging Chain: • Chain of density ρ supported at both ends, hangs under gravity. • It forms a catenary: y − y0 = a cosh [ (x − x0)/a] . • The Cotton Reel: • Pull on a cotton reel with spool radius, r, and outer radius, R. • Need to pull at angle given by cos θ = r/R to avoid rotation. • Warren Truss Bridge: • Modelled a truss bridge as massless beams joined at joints. • Method of joints: need to balance forces at each joint. Fluid Mechanics • A fluid is a material which deforms indefinitely under the application of a tangential or shear stress. • A solid will only deform until the elastic stresses in the material balance the applied stress. • In reality the distinction can be blurred: silly putty, toothpaste. The actual behaviour of the material depends upon timescales. • Liquids are (nearly) incompressible; gases are compressible. • Continuum Hypothesis: we describe the fluid as a continuum, instead of a collection of molecules. • This is clearly not true on very short (nanometre) length scales. • Shear stress only occurs if the fluid is flowing (unlike a solid). Hydrostatics (Fluids at Rest) • Consider a small element of a fluid at rest in a tank. What are the forces acting upon it? • The forces acting on the fluid are all body forces, proportional to the volume of the liquid. • We can show the pressure is isotropic (the same in all directions) by balancing forces on the prism of liquid: Fx : p2ac = p3ad sin θ Fz : p1ab = p3ad cos θ + 1 2 ρabcg • Since sin θ = c/d and cos θ = b/d, it follows that p2 = p3 and p1 = p3 + 1 2 ρcg. • Taking the prism size to zero, it follows that p1 = p2 = p3: the pressure is the same in all directions, independent of angle θ. Pascal’s Principle: The pressure exerted anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted equally in all directions, in such a way that initial variations in pressure are not changed. • Although the pressure is isotropic, it will not be constant throughout the body: pressure increases with depth in the ocean, and decreases with height in the atmosphere. • The hydraulic press, patented by Joseph Bramah in 1795, works using Pascal’s principle. • Assuming that the fluid is in equilibrium, and ignoring g, the constancy of pressure means that p = F1 A1 = F2 A2 → F2 = A2 A1 F1. • If A2 > A1, we can use a small force to lift a larger weight. • If the fluid in the left side moves down by h1, whilst that on the right side moves up by h2, then A1h1 = A2h2 by the incompressibility of the liquid. The net work done is then F1h1 − F2h2 = pA1h1 − pA2h2 = 0. Pressure Distribution in a Fluid at Rest • Since the fluid is at rest, there is no shear stress. • Consider a horizontal cylinder between x and x + dx, and assume that dx ≪ L and dA ≪ L2, where L is some characteristic length of the system. • Resolving forces in the x-direction, we see that p(x)dA = p(x + dx)dA → p(x) is constant. • Now repeat for a cyinder oriented in the y-direction. • Resolving forces in the y-direction, p(y+dy) dA+ρg dA dy = p(y) dA → p(y + dy) − p(y) dy = −ρ(y)g. • Taking the limit dy → 0, and assuming that ρ is constant, dp dy = −ρg → p2 − p1 = ρg(y1 − y2). (Pascal’s Law) The Atmosphere • We live at the bottom of an ocean of air – the atmosphere. • Let us assume that the temperature, T , of the atmosphere is constant, so that pV = nRT → ρ = nMm V = Mm RT p → ρ ∝ p. • It follows that the pressure, p(y), and density, ρ(y), of the atmosphere both vary with height, y, and that ρ(y) ∝ p(y). • From the previous analysis, dp dy = −ρ(y)g = − ρ0g p0 p(y) → p(y) = p0e−αy (law of atmospheres) • The parameter, α, is given by α = ρ0g p0 = Mmg RT ≈ 1 10 km . • The pressure at sea level is approximately 10N/cm2 ≡ 105Pa. • This is found using a barometer – a column of liquid, usually mercury, in a glass tube which is supported against gravity by the atmospheric pressure. • Typically h ≈ 76 cm for mercury, which has a density of 13.6 g/cm3, so that p0 = ρgh ≈ 1.03 × 105 Pa. • For water, with a density of 1 g/cm3, the corresponding column of water is about 10 m in height. This experiment was first performed by Torricelli in 1643. Summary of Lecture 7 • Pascal’s Principle: The pressure exerted anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted equally in all directions, in such a way that initial variations in pressure are not changed. • Hydraulic Press: Constant pressure in an incompressible fluid (neglecting gravity) means that a small force, F1, acting over a small area, A1, can balance a large force, F2, acting over a large area, A2, since p = F1/A1 = F2/A2. • In the presence of a gravitational field in the y-direction, pressure in a fluid varies according to dp dy = −ρ(y)g. • In an isothermal (constant temperature) atmosphere, p(y) = p0e−αy where α = Mmg RT ≈ 1 10km . Manometers and Snorkelling • The manometer is a device which allows us to measure pressure differences, with the sign indicating an over- or under-pressure, p1 = p0 + ρgh. • A typical person can cause h = 1 m momentarily in a water manometer, so snorkelling is restricted to this depth. • Elephants can actually snorkel up to the full 2 m length of their trunks – this is due to the different structure of their lungs (confirmed in 1992). Archimedes Principle • Consider the following thought experiment: a very thin plastic bag filled with water is placed in a swimming pool. Does it sink or float? • It appears static, so which forces are being balanced? There is a downward gravitational force, mg, on the mass of water in the bag, so there must be an upward buoyancy force, Fb = mg. • What is the origin of this force? The pressure at the bottom of the bag is greater than that at the top. • If we now imagine removing the plastic bag and leaving a hole. There is now only the upward buoyancy force Fb = mg acting on the hole. • Now consider placing a stone which exactly fits the hole. The volume of the stone is the same, but its density is greater than that of water, and so it will sink. • The apparent weight of the stone is less due to the buoyancy force – the apparent weight is F = M g − mg = (ρs − ρw)V g. • Replace the stone with a block of wood of the same size: the buoyancy force is greater than mwg, and the wood will rise to the surface. Archimedes’ Principle: A body which is fully or partially immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyancy force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. The Stability of Floating Objects • First of all we need to determine what we mean by “stable”. • If a body has exactly the same density as the fluid it is in, it will remain at rest wherever it is placed in the fluid: it is said to be neutrally buoyant. • A floating body may not be statically unstable, like a pencil balanced on its point. Any small disturbance will cause it to find a new equilibrium. • We check stability by disturbing the object from its initial position, and seeing whether it develops a restoring moment to return to its original position. • The object experiences two equal and opposite forces: gravity and the buoyancy force. • Gravity acts at the centre of mass, G, of the object. • Buoyancy acts at the centre of buoyancy, B, which is the centre of mass of the volume of fluid that has been displaced. • This will be identical to the centre of mass of the submerged portion of the object, if we assume it has uniform density. • If we tilt the object, its centre of buoyancy will change, and we will have to calculate its new position, B1. in order to see if the object will experience a restoring moment. • The point at which the line of action of the buoyant force cuts the original vertical line through G is the metacentre, M . • If M lies below G, an overturning moment is produced, and we have an unstable equilibrium. • If M lies above G, a righting moment is produced, and we have a stable equilibrium. • If M coincides with G, no moment is produced, and we have a neutral equilibrium. • Calculating the new centre of buoyancy, B1, can be difficult even for simple shapes. • As an iceberg melts, it may change its shape, and hence may change its stability. This can lead to an iceberg tsunami. Summary of Lecture 8 • Archimedes’ Principle: A body which is fully or partially immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyancy force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. • A floating object experiences two equal and opposite forces: its weight, acting at the centre of mass; the buoyancy force, acting at the centre of buoyancy (the centre of mass of the displaced fluid). These may combine to form a net moment. • To test the stability of a floating object, tilt it slightly, and see whether a righting or overturning moment is produced. • A neutrally buoyant object is in stable equilibrium when its centre of buoyancy lies above its centre of mass. • A floating object floats stably when its metacentre lies above its centre of mass. Viscosity • Viscosity is the resistance of one layer of fluid moving relative to adjacent layers of fluid. • We consider steady flow, where the velocity, v(r) at a point r does not depend upon time. • Such a viscous flow exhibits no velocity relative to a solid boundary e.g. water in a pipe. These are known as no-slip boundary conditions. • Consider a one-dimensional steady flow in a gap of height, h, between two parallel plates where the lower plate is stationary, and the upper plate moves with velocity v = ui. • Newton postulated that the tangential shear stress (force per unit area) need to maintain the upper plate at velocity u relative to the lower one is τ = µu h . • µ is the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid, and is constant for a particular fluid at a given temperature and pressure. • What are the dimensions of µ: [ τ ] = [F ]/[A] = M LT −2 · L −2 = M L−1T −2 [ µ ] = [τ ][ h] /[ u ] = M L−1T −2 · L · T L −1 = M L−1T −1. • The SI unit of viscosity is 1kg m−1s−1 =1 Pa s. Engineers often use Poise where 1 Poise=0.1 Pa s. • The viscosities of air and water at 300 K are 1.85×10−5 Pa s and 9.1×10−4 Pa s, respectively. • If we have a fluid flow, v(r) ≡ vx(y), then a similar analysis for the tangential shear stress between planes of fluid at y and y + δy gives τ (y) = µ lim δy→0 δvx δy = µ dvx dy . • This empirical linear result works surprisingly well for many fluids, and is the definition of a Newtonian fluid. • A shear-thickening fluid is one whose apparent viscosity appears to increase when the shear rate (velocity gradient) increases e.g. corn starch dissolved in water. • A shear-thinning fluid is one whose apparent viscosity appears to decrease when the shear rate (velocity gradient) increases e.g. ketchup and wall paint. • A viscoelastic material shows a combination of elastic and viscous properties. Laminar Viscous Flow • Consider the situation shown above where the upper plate moves relative to the lower at velocity ui. • The fluid velocity will only have a component in the x-direction, and this will only vary as a function of y i.e. v(r) = vx(y)i. • Consider the forces on an fluid element of size dx × dy × dz. • For this geometry, steady state flow implies no acceleration. The sum of external forces on this element must be zero. Fx: [ p(x) − p(x + dx)] dydz + [τ (y + dy) − τ (y)] dxdz = [ dτ dy − dp dx ] dxdydz Fy: [ p(y) − p(y + dy)] dxdz = − dp dy dxdydz • Since the pressure is constant, then the total force per unit volume on the element is in the x-direction, and is given by fx = dτ dy = 0 → µ d2vx dy2 = 0 → vx(y) = Cy + D. • As we know that vx(0) = 0 and vx(h) = u, it follows that we get the linear behaviour vx = uy h . Summary of Lecture 9 • Viscosity is the resistance of one layer of fluid relative to adjacent layers of fluid, τ = µ dvx dy , where τ is the tangential stress, dvx/dy is the rate of shear, and µ is the coefficient of viscosity. Poiseuille Flow in a Cylindrical Pipe • Suppose fluid of viscosity µ flows along a cylindrical pipe of radius a and length ℓ due to a pressure difference p. • Consider a cylinder of fluid of radius r < a – this experiences a force πr2p due to the pressure difference. • The cylinder may be viewed as being made up of cylindrical shells which exert forces on each other given by µ A dv/dr, where dv/dr is the velocity gradient, and A the shell’s area. • The viscous force on the outermost shell is balanced by the pressure force, since we have laminar flow, so that µA dv dr + πr2p = 0 → µ · 2πrℓ · dv dr + πr2p = 0 → dv dr = − pr 2µℓ → v(r) = − p 4µℓ r2 + c. • Since v = 0 when r = a, it follows that v(r) = p 4µℓ (a 2 − r2). • The total volume of fluid flowing along the pipe per second is dV dt = ∫ S v(r) dS = ∫ a 0 v(r)·2πrdr = πp 2µℓ ∫ a 0 (a 2−r2)rdr = πpa4 8µℓ . • To understand this formula, consider the formula for current in a cylindrical wire of radius a, length ℓ, and resistivity ρ, I = V R = V ρ × ℓ/πa2 • The Poiseuille formula may be written in the form dV dt = p × πa2 8πµ × ℓ/πa2 = F 8πµ × ℓ/πa2 • It follows that 8πµ is analogous to the resistivity, ρ. Streamlines and Continuity • A streamline is the path traced out by an infinitesimal element of the fluid. • The velocity of the fluid element is tangential to the streamline. • Streamlines do not cross one another. • A set of streamlines define a tube of flow, the borders of which the fluid does not cross. • The mass of fluid passing through area A1 in time ∆t must be the same as that passing through area A2 in time ∆t, so that ρ1A1v1∆t = ρ2A2v2∆t → ρ1A1v1 = ρ2A2v2. (continuity eqn) • If the fluid is incompressible, ρ1 = ρ2, so that the continuity equation becomes A1v1 = A2v2. • Consider the decrease in area of a stream of water from a tap. • Energy conservation and the continuity equation give v2 2 = v2 1+2gh and A1v1 = A2v2 → A2 = v1 v2 A1 = v1A1√ v2 1 + 2gh . Bernoulli’s Equation • Incompressible, inviscid, steady flow in a pipe of small radius. • Consider two points in the fluid, where pressure, cross-section, velocity, and height are (p1, A1, v1, y1) and (p2, A2, v2, y2). • The change in the total energy (kinetic plus potential) of a fluid element of volume ∆V in moving from point 1 to 2 is ρ ∆V ( 1 2 v2 2 + gy2 − 1 2 v2 1 − gy1). • If this is the amount of fluid that flows in time ∆t, then ∆V = A1v1∆t = A2v2∆t. • The work done on the fluid by the pressure gradient is then F1∆ℓ1 − F2∆ℓ2 = p1A1v1∆t − p2A2v2∆t = (p1 − p2)∆V. • Equating the work done on the fluid to the change in energy, we see that ∆V [ 1 2 ρ (v2 2 − v2 1) + ρg(y2 − y1) + (p2 − p1) ] = 0. • This may be rewritten in the form p + 1 2 ρv2 + ρgy = const. (Bernoulli’s equation) Applications of Bernoulli’s Equation • Aerofoils: If the air flows faster over the top surface of an aerofoil than the bottom, the pressure on the top surface will be lower than on the bottom, and there will be a net lift force. • A Pitot tube measures airspeed of an aircraft. A closed tube is pointed directly into the airflow, the air comes to rest, and the stagnation pressure is measured. This is then compared to the dynamic pressure, which is measured using static ports. • A Venturi flow meter measures fluid flow rate, Q, by increasing fluid velocity by constricting from area A1 to A2, and using the consequent pressure difference to find the velocities v1 and v2: Q = v1A1 = v2A2 and p1 − p2 = 1 2 ρ(v2 2 − v2 1) → Q = A1A2 √ 2(p1 − p2) ρ(A2 1 − A2 2) . Summary of Lecture 10 • Poiseuille Flow: Fluid of viscosity µ flows along a cylindrical pipe of radius a and length ℓ due to a pressure difference p. The velocity profile, v(r), is v(r) = p 4µℓ (a 2 − r2) . • Streamline: path traced out by an infinitesimal element of fluid. • Consider a fluid flowing in a pipe of variable cross-section. If ρ1, v1, A1, and ρ2, v2, A2, are the density, velocity and areas at points 1 and 2, then the mass flow rate is ˙M = ρ1v1A1 = ρ2v2A2. • Bernoulli’s Equation: For incompressible, inviscid, steady flow in a pipe of small radius, p + 1 2 ρv2 + ρgy = constant. The Advective Derivative • Consider the motion of an element of fluid of volume dV in a velocity field v(r, t). Newton’s second law gives ρ dV d dt [v(r, t) ] = f dV → ρ dv dt = f. • For now let us assume incompressible flow, so that ρ is constant. The fluid element moves through the velocity field, so that the time-derivative is more complicated, d dt [ vx(x(t), y(t), z(t), t) ] = ∂vx ∂x dx dt + ∂vx ∂y dy dt + ∂vx ∂z dz dt + ∂vx ∂t = vx ∂vx ∂x + vy ∂vx ∂y + vz ∂vx ∂z + ∂vx ∂t = (v · ∇)vx + ∂vx ∂t . • The vector differential operator, ∇, known as nabla or del, is defined by ∇ = i ∂ ∂x + j ∂ ∂y + k ∂ ∂z . • The v · ∇ operator is v · ∇ = vx ∂ ∂x + vy ∂ ∂y + vz ∂ ∂z . • The advective derivative is then given by dv dt = ∂v ∂t + (v · ∇) v. • The force per unit volume due to a pressure gradient is fp = − ∂p ∂x i − ∂p ∂y j − ∂p ∂z k = −∇p. • The force per unit volume due to gravity is fg = ρg, where g is the gravitational field strength. • Finally, for an incompressible fluid, the force per unit volume due to viscosity may be shown to be fv = µ∇ 2v where ∇ 2 = ∂2 ∂x2 + ∂2 ∂y2 + ∂2 ∂z2 . • The Navier-Stokes equation of motion for an incompressible fluid is thus ρ ∂v ∂t + ρ (v · ∇) v = −∇p + ρg + µ∇ 2v. • In terms of the individual components of the fluid velocity ∂vx ∂t + vx ∂vx ∂x + vy ∂vx ∂y + vz ∂vx ∂z = − 1 ρ ∂p ∂x − gx + µ ρ [ ∂2vx ∂x2 + ∂2vx ∂y2 + ∂2vx ∂z2 ] • The incompressibility of the fluid gives the additional condition ∇ · v = 0 ≡ ∂vx ∂x + ∂vy ∂y + ∂vz ∂z = 0. Summary of Lecture 11 • Advection is the transport of a substance or quantity by the bulk motion of a fluid. • A fluid element can be accelerated by a static fluid flow pattern, as the fluid element is advected by the flow. Newton’s second law applies to the fluid element, and not the fluid flow pattern. • If a fluid has a velocity field, v(r, t), the acceleration of the fluid element at a point is given by the advective derivative dv dt = ∂v ∂t + (v · ∇)v where ∇ = i ∂ ∂x + j ∂ ∂y + k ∂ ∂z .","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
