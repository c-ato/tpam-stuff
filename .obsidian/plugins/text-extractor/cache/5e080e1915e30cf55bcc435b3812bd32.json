He was awarded a Nobel Prize for his hypothesis in 1929 4 Davisson & Germer experiment In 1925 Elsasser predicted that electrons would be diffracted by crystalline materials • This was observed experimentally in 1927 by Davisson & Germer, and independently by G.P. Thomson • de Broglie’s hypothesis appeared in his PhD thesis in 1924. He was awarded a Nobel Prize for his hypothesis in 1929 • Davisson and Thomson shared a Nobel Prize for their experimental work in 1937 5 Davisson & Germer experiment - Results Diffraction peaks from a crystal, just like we found from X-rays: 6 GP Thomson experiment – powder electron diffraction G.P. Thomson was the son of J.J. Thomson – his father discovered the electron, and he established its wave behaviour – they both won Nobel Prizes (in 1906 and 1937) Can use the same target to diffract both X-rays and electrons:","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
