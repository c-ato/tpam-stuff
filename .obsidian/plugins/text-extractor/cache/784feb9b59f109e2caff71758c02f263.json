It can be at any angle with E. • This work done by an E-field represents a decrease in the electric potential energy 𝜹𝑼 = −𝜹𝑾 6 𝛿𝑊 = 𝑞𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 𝛿𝑈 = −𝑞𝑬 ∙ 𝑑𝒍 Electrical Potential Energy • For +q, moving along E for dl distance, U is negative. Energy decrease. • For –q, moving along E for dl distance, U is positive. Energy increase. • If the E-field varies as particle moves from a point a to b we need to integrate to find the total change in potential energy • 𝑈𝑏 − 𝑈𝑎 = −𝑞 ׬𝑎 𝑏 𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑙 7 Ub - Ua = -q' E.dl a b ò a b dl Ub < Ua a b dl Ub - Ua = -q' E.dl a b ò Ub < Ua q’ is positive charge moving from a to b Electrical Potential Energy • Electric potential energy for a charged particle in an electric field depends on: 1) The property of the electric field. 2) The charge, both magnitude and sign. • We want to describe the potential energy on a “per unit charge” basis. – Similar to: Electric field “E” describes the force per unit charge. 9 Definition of Electric Potential, V • V is Potential Energy of the system per unit charge 10 𝑉 = 𝑈 𝑞 𝑈𝑏 − 𝑈𝑎 = −𝑞 න 𝑎 𝑏𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑙 𝑉𝑏 − 𝑉𝑎 = − න 𝑎 𝑏𝐸 ∙ 𝑑𝑙 It is a property of a point in an E-field.

If released the positive charge will accelerate in the direction of the electric field, from high V to low V. 19 E-field lines and Equipotential Surfaces 20 Note that lines of force are always perpendicular to the equipotentials •Surfaces over which V is constant are called equipotentials Vb - Va = - E.dl a b ò Calculation of E from the Electric Potential: • Electric field can be calculated from V, and there are cases where it is easier finding V first, because V is a scalar quantity 21 ò-= ldEV .

Why? Charged water droplets on wire become elongated to a point because of repulsion.
