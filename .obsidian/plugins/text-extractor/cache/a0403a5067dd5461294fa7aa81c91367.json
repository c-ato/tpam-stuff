Applying Gauss’s law to the closed cylindrical Gaussian surface as shown, no ﬂux through end faces, E is constant over curved face and always perpendicular to the surface, one has: ∫ S E · dS = Q ϵ0 2πrlE = λl ϵ0 ⇒ E = λ 2πϵ0r The electric ﬁeld is pointing in the direction shown in the ﬁgure. Students are expected to express the result in vector form or explicitly state the direction in which the ﬁeld is pointing. [2] 2. If the cylindrical Gaussian surface has now radius greater than r2 the enclosed charge is zero. The total area of the surface is ﬁnite and therefore ⃗E outside the tube is zero everywhere. [1] 3. We apply Gauss’s law again with the charge density on the outer tube which is twice the initial value: (a) For r1 < r < r2 nothing changes, and the result is as above; [1] (b) For r > r2 the net charge is now different from zero and is −λ. The ﬁeld is therefore ⃗E = − λ 2πϵ0r ˆr . Students should express the result either in vector form, or if simply E is reported they should state that the ﬁeld is pointing towards the centre of the rod/tube. [1] 4. We use Vb − Va = − ∫ b a ⃗E · d⃗r Vb − Va = − λ 2πϵ0 ln ( rb ra ) Computing it between the tube and the rod the result is: V (r2) − V (r1) = − λ 2πϵ0 ln ( r2 r1 ) [2] 5. If the potential is set to zero at inﬁnity, V (r → ∞) = 0, then V (r = r2) = 0, because the ﬁeld is zero outside the tube; Hence: V (r2) − V (r) = 0 − V (r) = − λ 2πϵ0 ln ( r2 r ) and one obtains: V (r1) = λ 2πϵ0 ln ( r2 r1 ) [1] 6. Sketch is shown below. Students should show that the ﬁeld is zero inside the rod and outside the tube, the descrease of the ﬁeld and of the potential between r1 and r2, with potential constant and non-zero inside the rod.
