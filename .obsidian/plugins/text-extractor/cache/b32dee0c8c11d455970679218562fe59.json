What are the global maximum and minimum values of this function? Assessed Problems 1 Richard Mason 03 33961 Introduction to Probability and Statistics Problem 1. A busy shop has three queues of people. Unfortunately the three tills are somewhat unreliable. • Till A fails with probability 0.1. • Till B fails with probability 0.1. • Till C fails with probability 0.05. Once a till fails it must be reset, and then it continues to work. After an hour, 30 people used Till A, 35 used Till B and 35 used Till C. 1. What is the probability that someone (if selected at random) used till A or C? [2] 2. What is the probability of someone having a till failure if selected at random? Hint: Marginalise. [2] 3. Two poeple are selected at random. What is the probability that exactly one of them had a till failure? [2] 4. Thee people are selected at random. What is the probability that they all used diﬀerent tills? State your sampling assumptions (with or without replacement). [1] 5. Given that someone experienced a failing till, what is the probability that the till they used was B? [2] 6. What is the probability that that person did not use Till B?

The particle initially has velocity v at angle of elevation θ with respect to the x-axis, and air resistance may be neglected. You may freely use the results for x(t), y(t) and y(x) derived in lectures. (a) Derive expressions for the horizontal range, X, and the maximum height, H, in terms of the parameters of the problem. [3] (b) Derive an expression for the angle of elevation, θ, as a function of X and H. [2] (c) Derive an expression for the velocity of projection, v, in terms of X, H and g. [3] (d) Derive an expression for the time of ﬂight, T , in terms of X, H and g. [2]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
