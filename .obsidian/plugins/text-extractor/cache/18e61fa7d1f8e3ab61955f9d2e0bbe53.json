Each question carries equal weight. You are advised to initially spend no more than 45 minutes on each question and then to return to any incomplete questions if you have time at the end. An indication of the number of marks allocated to parts of questions is shown in square brackets. Page 1 Turn over Section A 1. (a) Let f : R → R. Deﬁne what it means that lim x→−∞ f (x) = ∞.
