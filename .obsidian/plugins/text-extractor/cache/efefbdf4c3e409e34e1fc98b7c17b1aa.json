R = R1 + R2 Thermal resistances add like electrical resistances in parallel! 1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 Recap from last time Black bodies emit and absorb EM radiation of all wavelengths, without reflecting any (unlike a white body, which reflect all light incident on them) If a black body is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings (both at some temperature T), they emit exactly the same power spectrum as they absorb 𝑢 λ, 𝑇 = 8𝜋ℎ𝑐 λ5 1 (ⅇ − ℎ𝑐 λ𝑘𝐵𝑇 − 1) Planck’s law Non-black bodies characterised by emissivity, ε (fraction of black body spectrum absorbed) Recap from last time By finding the maximum of the spectrum (through differentiation), you can find the wavelength corresponding to the maximal power output 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 ≈ ℎ𝑐 5𝑘𝐵𝑇 ≈ 2.9×10−3 mK 𝑇 Can also integrate the whole spectrum to give ሶ𝑄, the total power output (energy per unit time) https://phys.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/15630/CNX_UPhysics_39_01_BBradcurve.jpg?revision=1 ሶ𝑄 = 𝜀𝜎𝐴𝑇4 Emissivity (=1 for a black body) Stefan’s constant 5.67 x 10-8 W m-2 K-1 Surface area of body (that is radiating power) Temperature Kinetic theory of gases Gas molecules move “randomly” – in that they can have vastly differing velocities (and positions) Ideally we would be able to describe a gas in terms of the individual molecules… but pretty hard to do that for 1023 molecules Kinetic theory of gases Easiest way to do this is statistically – like we have previously touched upon with temperature With huge numbers of particles, statistical predictions improve (so can reliably work with probabilities of velocities) e.g. uncertainty of a Poisson distribution 𝜎 = 𝑁 𝑁 Probability Probability exists on a number line between 0 and 1 e.g. throwing a 7 on a 6 sided die or throwing either a 1,2,3,4,5,6? 0 (will never happen) 1 (will happen) Have to be careful in the real world with saying something is 100% certain (P=1)! Probability Probability of getting any specific number on a 6-sided die (basically) 1/6 Probability of getting two of the same number 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 as these are INDEPENDENT Probability of getting n of the same number? (1/6)n Monkeys on a typewriter How would we work out the probability that given 100 monkeys typing (essentially randomly) for the entire age of the universe, one would be able to write A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens? It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times?! You stupid monkey 140000 words in ToTC Average word length 5 characters Age of the universe ~1018 seconds 44 keys on the typewriter Monkeys can type 10 characters a second How would we work out the probability that given 100 monkeys typing (essentially randomly) for the entire age of the universe, one would be able to write A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens? Chance of a monkey getting the first character right: 1/44 Chance of a monkey getting all of the characters right: (1/44)140000*5 = 10-1150417 Number of characters that a monkey can type: 10 x 1018 = 1019 Number of sequences of 700000 characters: 1019 – 700000 = 1019 Probability of typing ToTC for 100 monkeys: 10-1150417 x 1019 x 100 = 10-1150396 What about for infinity monkeys? 10-1150417 x 1019 x infinity = infinity Probabilities greater than 1 Probabilities greater than 1 usually indicate that the event will occur multiple times during one measurement Probability of producing a positron: 0.94278 Probability of producing a 511 keV gamma is double https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Birthday_paradox_probability.svg/1280px-Birthday_paradox_probability.svg.png Probability of a pair of people having the same birthday reaches 50% for only 23 people – seems counterintuitive for 365 days: (23x22)/2 = 253 possible pairs! The atmosphere Ionosphere: essentially a mirror which reflects EM radiation of <40 MHz (> 7.5 metres) Stratosphere: region of the atmosphere where the ozone layer exists Troposphere: bottom few km of the atmosphere which we will focus on here https://ilearncana.com/upload/original/8352cdd9e03ef06d44b860024116e885.jpg Isothermal model of the atmosphere Assumptions: 1) Atmosphere is isothermal (in reality, dT/dh ~ 10 K km-1) [5.8] 2) Treat the atmosphere as consisting of an ideal gas (good assumption for majority of component gases at low pressure – not water vapour) 3) The Earth is flat (~15 km << 6400 km) 4) The atmosphere is stationary and thus in mechanical equilibrium dh Cross-sectional area A dh Cross-sectional area A 𝑃 = 𝜌𝑁𝑘𝐵𝑇 Number density (N/V) P(0) sea level P(dh) Forces: forces due to pressure and gravity (in equilibrium) 0 = 𝑃 0 𝐴 − 𝑃 ⅆℎ 𝐴 − 𝑚 𝜌𝑁 ⅆℎ 𝐴𝑔 0 = 𝑑𝑃𝐴 − 𝑚 𝜌𝑁 ⅆℎ 𝐴𝑔 Isothermal model of the atmosphere 𝜌𝑁 ℎ = 𝜌𝑁 0 ⅇ − 𝑚𝑔ℎ 𝑘𝐵𝑇 𝑃 ℎ = 𝑃 0 ⅇ− 𝑚𝑔ℎ 𝑘𝐵𝑇 𝑚𝑔ℎ 𝑘𝐵𝑇 must be dimensionless, and so 𝑘𝐵𝑇 𝑚𝑔 must have dimensions of h -> scale height, h0 ( at which P(h0) = P(0)e-1 ) Scale heights Particle Mass Scale height O2 gas 32 amu = 5.3137e-26 kg ~10 km N2 gas 28 amu = 4.6495e-26 kg ~10 km Covid virus ~10-18 kg ~0.5 mm Smallest known virus ~10-21 kg ~50 cm Bacteria ~10-15 kg ~5 μm Dr Stuart Pirrie ~102 kg ~50 ym (10-24 m is 1 ym)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
