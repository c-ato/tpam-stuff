(a) Let the symbols A, V , u, t, m, ρ represent area, volume, speed, time, mass and density. What are the dimensions of A, V , u, t, m, ρ. [3] (b) In ﬂuid dynamics Bernoulli’s Law says that B = p ρ + 1 2 u 2 + gz, where B is Bernoulli’s constant, p is pressure, ρ is density, u is speed, g is the constant acceleration of gravity and z is vertical displacement. Given that Bernoulli’s Law is dimensionally correct, what are the dimensions of pressure p and Bernoulli’s constant B. [4] 2. A projectile with mass m is ﬁred at an angle θ to the horizontal with speed V . (a) Neglecting air resistance, and assuming that the acceleration of gravity is constant, use Newton’s Second Law of Motion to determine the location of the projectile as a function of time. [5] (b) Calculate the speed of the projectile as a function of time. [2] (c) Show that the sum of the projectile’s kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy is constant. [3] 3. A particle is located at position r with respect to the origin of a 2-dimensional co-ordinate system. If i and j are the unit vectors in a (x, y) Cartesian co-ordinate system and er and eθ are the unit vectors in a (r, θ) polar coordinate system: (a) Determine expressions for er and eθ in terms of i and j. [4] (b) Derive an expression for the velocity dr dt of the particle in polar coordinates. [6] ? Turn over - 3 - Any Calculator SECTION B 4. A particle of mass m is attached to a spring with a Hooke’s constant of k. Suppose that the particle is on a horizontal frictionless surface and x measures the distance of the particle away from the equilibrium length of the spring. (a) Use Hooke’s law to determine the force acting on the particle due to the spring. [3] (b) Write down Newton’s second law for the particle and hence determine the location of the particle as a function of time, if at time t = 0, x = xo and dx dt = 0. [7] (c) Show that the sum of the particles kinetic energy and potential energy is constant. [5] (d) If we now assume that the particle is subject to a frictional resistance force equal to −b dx dt , determine the location of the particle as a function of time, where once again at time t = 0, x = xo and dx dt = 0. The constants k and b are related by k = 3b2 16m . In this case, what is lim t→∞ x? [10] 5. In polar coordinates Newton’s second law for a particle of mass m can be written as F = Frer + Fθeθ = m ([ d2r dt2 − r ( dθ dt )2] er + [ 2 dr dt dθ dt + r d2θ dt2 ] eθ ) . Assume that the particle is subject to a central force with Fr = −g(r) (for some function g) and Fθ = 0. (a) Show that the quantity h = r2 dθ dt is constant and hence or otherwise show that the position vector of the particle sweeps out equal areas about the origin in equal times. [8] (b) If u = 1/r show that the radial component of Newton’s second law becomes d2u dθ2 + u = g (1/u) mh2u2 , where h is the constant identiﬁed above. [10] (c) Determine the general form of the orbit r(θ) of the particle if g(r) = γ/r2 where γ is a dimensional constant. What are the dimensions of γ? [5] (d) Under what condition are the orbits calculated above bounded? [2] ?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
