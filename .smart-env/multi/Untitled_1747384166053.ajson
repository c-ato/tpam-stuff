So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_1 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_1 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1$, and there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.\n    Consider the sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2$:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Using the associativity and commutativity of vector addition in $V$, we can rearrange this as:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) + (\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, their sum $\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ is also in $U$ (by closure under addition in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$, their sum $\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$ is also in $W$ (by closure under addition in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} = \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.

Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$.

The zero vector is in $U + W$.\n2.  $U + W$ is closed under vector addition.\n3.  $U + W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHere is the proof:\n\n**Proof that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$:**\n\nSince $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$, they satisfy the subspace properties themselves.\n\n1.  **Zero Vector:** Since $U$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in U$. Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$. Thus, $\\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in $U+W$. So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_1 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_1 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1$, and there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.\n    Consider the sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2$:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Using the associativity and commutativity of vector addition in $V$, we can rearrange this as:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) + (\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, their sum $\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ is also in $U$ (by closure under addition in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$, their sum $\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$ is also in $W$ (by closure under addition in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} = \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} \\in W$.\n    The sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_{sum} + \\mathbf{w}_{sum}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 \\in U+W$. This shows that $U+W$ is closed under vector addition.\n\n3.  **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be any vector in $U+W$ and let $c$ be any scalar. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}$.\n    Consider the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w})$\n    Using the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in $V$, we have:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u} + c\\mathbf{w}$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{u}$ is also in $U$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{w}$ is also in $W$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} \\in W$.\n    The scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}_{scaled} + \\mathbf{w}_{scaled}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $c\\mathbf{v} \\in U+W$.

The zero vector is in $U + W$.\n2.  $U + W$ is closed under vector addition.\n3.  $U + W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHere is the proof:\n\n**Proof that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$:**\n\nSince $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$, they satisfy the subspace properties themselves.\n\n1.  **Zero Vector:** Since $U$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in U$. Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$. Thus, $\\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in $U+W$. So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_1 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_1 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1$, and there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.\n    Consider the sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2$:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Using the associativity and commutativity of vector addition in $V$, we can rearrange this as:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) + (\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, their sum $\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ is also in $U$ (by closure under addition in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$, their sum $\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$ is also in $W$ (by closure under addition in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} = \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} \\in W$.\n    The sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_{sum} + \\mathbf{w}_{sum}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 \\in U+W$. This shows that $U+W$ is closed under vector addition.\n\n3.  **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be any vector in $U+W$ and let $c$ be any scalar. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}$.\n    Consider the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w})$\n    Using the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in $V$, we have:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u} + c\\mathbf{w}$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{u}$ is also in $U$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{w}$ is also in $W$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} \\in W$.\n    The scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}_{scaled} + \\mathbf{w}_{scaled}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $c\\mathbf{v} \\in U+W$.

The zero vector is in $U + W$.\n2.  $U + W$ is closed under vector addition.\n3.  $U + W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHere is the proof:\n\n**Proof that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$:**\n\nSince $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$, they satisfy the subspace properties themselves.\n\n1.  **Zero Vector:** Since $U$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in U$. Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$. Thus, $\\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in $U+W$. So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_1 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_1 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1$, and there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.\n    Consider the sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2$:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Using the associativity and commutativity of vector addition in $V$, we can rearrange this as:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) + (\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, their sum $\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ is also in $U$ (by closure under addition in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$, their sum $\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$ is also in $W$ (by closure under addition in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} = \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} \\in W$.\n    The sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_{sum} + \\mathbf{w}_{sum}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 \\in U+W$. This shows that $U+W$ is closed under vector addition.\n\n3.  **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be any vector in $U+W$ and let $c$ be any scalar. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}$.\n    Consider the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w})$\n    Using the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in $V$, we have:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u} + c\\mathbf{w}$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{u}$ is also in $U$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{w}$ is also in $W$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} \\in W$.\n    The scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}_{scaled} + \\mathbf{w}_{scaled}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $c\\mathbf{v} \\in U+W$.

The zero vector is in $U + W$.\n2.  $U + W$ is closed under vector addition.\n3.  $U + W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHere is the proof:\n\n**Proof that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$:**\n\nSince $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$, they satisfy the subspace properties themselves.\n\n1.  **Zero Vector:** Since $U$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in U$. Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$. Thus, $\\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in $U+W$. So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_1 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_1 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1$, and there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.\n    Consider the sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2$:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Using the associativity and commutativity of vector addition in $V$, we can rearrange this as:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) + (\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, their sum $\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ is also in $U$ (by closure under addition in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$, their sum $\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$ is also in $W$ (by closure under addition in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} = \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} \\in W$.\n    The sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_{sum} + \\mathbf{w}_{sum}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 \\in U+W$. This shows that $U+W$ is closed under vector addition.\n\n3.  **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be any vector in $U+W$ and let $c$ be any scalar. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}$.\n    Consider the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w})$\n    Using the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in $V$, we have:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u} + c\\mathbf{w}$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{u}$ is also in $U$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{w}$ is also in $W$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} \\in W$.\n    The scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}_{scaled} + \\mathbf{w}_{scaled}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $c\\mathbf{v} \\in U+W$.

The zero vector is in $U + W$.\n2.  $U + W$ is closed under vector addition.\n3.  $U + W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHere is the proof:\n\n**Proof that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$:**\n\nSince $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$, they satisfy the subspace properties themselves.\n\n1.  **Zero Vector:** Since $U$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in U$. Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$. Thus, $\\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in $U+W$. So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_1 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_1 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1$, and there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.\n    Consider the sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2$:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Using the associativity and commutativity of vector addition in $V$, we can rearrange this as:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) + (\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, their sum $\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ is also in $U$ (by closure under addition in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$, their sum $\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$ is also in $W$ (by closure under addition in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} = \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} \\in W$.\n    The sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_{sum} + \\mathbf{w}_{sum}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 \\in U+W$. This shows that $U+W$ is closed under vector addition.\n\n3.  **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be any vector in $U+W$ and let $c$ be any scalar. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}$.\n    Consider the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w})$\n    Using the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in $V$, we have:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u} + c\\mathbf{w}$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{u}$ is also in $U$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{w}$ is also in $W$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} \\in W$.\n    The scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}_{scaled} + \\mathbf{w}_{scaled}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $c\\mathbf{v} \\in U+W$.

Current I2 is shown flowing from the 2Ω resistor into node 'a'.\n- A 5V voltage source is connected in series with a 3Ω resistor. The positive terminal of the 5V source is on the right, connected to the 3Ω resistor, and the negative terminal is connected to the common bottom line. The other end of the 3Ω resistor is connected to node 'a'. Current I3 is shown flowing from node 'a' through the 3Ω resistor.\n- A 1Ω resistor is connected between node 'a' and the common bottom line. Current I1 is shown flowing from node 'a' through the 1Ω resistor.\n- The common bottom line serves as a reference node, connected to the negative terminals of both voltage sources and one end of the 1Ω resistor.\n\nThe diagram also indicates the directions of currents I1, I2, and I3 at node 'a'. I2 flows into node 'a', while I1 and I3 flow out of node 'a'. This setup suggests that Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) can be applied at node 'a', stating that I2 = I1 + I3."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":615,"completion_tokens":377,"total_tokens":1456}},"gemini-1747384338478":{"id":"gemini-1747384338478","object":"chat.completion","created":1747384338478,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"","tool_calls":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"lookup","arguments":"{\"hypotheticals\":{\"1\":\"How to solve problem 4bii from A36781_LCVecGeoLinAlgebra_QP_Main2024.pdf?\",\"2\":\"Explain the concepts needed to solve problem 4bii from A36781_LCVecGeoLinAlgebra_QP_Main2024.pdf.\",\"3\":\"Provide the solution to problem 4bii from A36781_LCVecGeoLinAlgebra_QP_Main2024.pdf.\"}}"}}]},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1240,"completion_tokens":126,"total_tokens":1725}},"gemini-1747384362349":{"id":"gemini-1747384362349","object":"chat.completion","created":1747384362481,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Based on the information I have, I encountered an error when trying to retrieve the content of the PDF file `Year 1/Formative Problems/Problem sheet/Exam papers/2024/Paper/A36781_LCVecGeoLinAlgebra_QP_Main2024.pdf`.\n\nTherefore, I cannot directly help you with question 4bii from that specific document at this time.\n\nIf you can provide the text of question 4bii, or describe the problem, I would be happy to try and help you based on the information you provide."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":9161,"completion_tokens":123,"total_tokens":9620}},"gemini-1747384384486":{"id":"gemini-1747384384486","object":"chat.completion","created":1747384384656,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Thank you for providing the file path again.\n\nUnfortunately, I am still encountering an error when trying to retrieve the content from the PDF file located at `Year 1/Formative Problems/Problem sheet/Exam papers/2024/Paper/A36781_LCVecGeoLinAlgebra_QP_Main2024.pdf`.\n\nIt seems I am unable to access the content of this specific file.\n\nIf you can copy and paste the question you need help with (question 4bii) directly into our chat, I would be happy to assist you based on the text you provide."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":9442,"completion_tokens":129,"total_tokens":9986}},"gemini-1747384443051":{"id":"gemini-1747384443051","object":"chat.completion","created":1747384447417,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Based on the image you provided, question 4b(ii) asks to prove that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$, where $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of a vector space $V$, and $U + W = \\{\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w} : \\mathbf{u} \\in U \\text{ and } \\mathbf{w} \\in W\\}$.\n\nTo prove that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$, we need to show that it satisfies the three conditions for a subspace:\n1.  The zero vector is in $U + W$.\n2.  $U + W$ is closed under vector addition.\n3.  $U + W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHere is the proof:\n\n**Proof that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$:**\n\nSince $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$, they satisfy the subspace properties themselves.\n\n1.  **Zero Vector:** Since $U$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in U$. Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$. Thus, $\\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in $U+W$. So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_1 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_1 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1$, and there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.\n    Consider the sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2$:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Using the associativity and commutativity of vector addition in $V$, we can rearrange this as:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) + (\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, their sum $\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ is also in $U$ (by closure under addition in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$, their sum $\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$ is also in $W$ (by closure under addition in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} = \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} \\in W$.\n    The sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_{sum} + \\mathbf{w}_{sum}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 \\in U+W$. This shows that $U+W$ is closed under vector addition.\n\n3.  **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be any vector in $U+W$ and let $c$ be any scalar. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}$.\n    Consider the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w})$\n    Using the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in $V$, we have:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u} + c\\mathbf{w}$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{u}$ is also in $U$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{w}$ is also in $W$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} \\in W$.\n    The scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}_{scaled} + \\mathbf{w}_{scaled}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $c\\mathbf{v} \\in U+W$.

They also state that $\\alpha$ is chosen to eliminate the cross term $xy$.\n\nLet's proceed using the method implied by your notes: substitute the rotation formulas into the equation $-2x^{2}+2\\sqrt[  ]{ 3 }xy-4=0$ and choose $\\alpha$ such that the coefficient of the $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term becomes zero.\n\nFrom the notes, the coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ after substitution is related to the terms involving $\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ and $\\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha$.\n\nLet's re-do the substitution carefully, focusing on the $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ terms:\n$$-2x^2 = -2(\\tilde{x}\\cos\\alpha - \\tilde{y}\\sin\\alpha)^2 = -2(\\tilde{x}^2\\cos^2\\alpha - 2\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha + \\tilde{y}^2\\sin^2\\alpha)$$\nThe $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term from this part is $-2(-2\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha)\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} = 4\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$.\n\n$$2\\sqrt{3}xy = 2\\sqrt{3}(\\tilde{x}\\cos\\alpha - \\tilde{y}\\sin\\alpha)(\\tilde{x}\\sin\\alpha + \\tilde{y}\\cos\\alpha)$$\n$$ = 2\\sqrt{3}(\\tilde{x}^2\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha + \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}\\cos^2\\alpha - \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}\\sin^2\\alpha - \\tilde{y}^2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha)$$\nThe $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term from this part is $2\\sqrt{3}(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha)\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$.\n\nThe original equation is $-2x^{2}+2\\sqrt[  ]{ 3 }xy-4=0$. The terms contributing to $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ are from $-2x^2$ and $2\\sqrt{3}xy$.\nThe total coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ in the transformed equation is:\n$$ 4\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha + 2\\sqrt{3}(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha) $$\nWe want this coefficient to be zero:\n$$ 4\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha + 2\\sqrt{3}(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha) = 0 $$\nUsing double angle identities ($\\sin(2\\alpha) = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ and $\\cos(2\\alpha) = \\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha$):\n$$ 2\\sin(2\\alpha) + 2\\sqrt{3}\\cos(2\\alpha) = 0 $$\n$$ 2\\sin(2\\alpha) = -2\\sqrt{3}\\cos(2\\alpha) $$\nIf $\\cos(2\\alpha) \\neq 0$, we can divide by $2\\cos(2\\alpha)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{\\cos(2\\alpha)} = -\\sqrt{3} $$\n$$ \\tan(2\\alpha) = -\\sqrt{3} $$\n\nThe general solution for $2\\alpha$ is $2\\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} + n\\pi$ for integer $n$. A common choice is $2\\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, which gives $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\nNow, using $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, we have $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nSubstitute these values into the rotation formulas:\n$$ x = \\tilde{x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\tilde{y}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{x} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}) $$\n$$ y = \\tilde{x}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + \\tilde{y}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{y}) $$\n\nNow substitute these into the original equation $-2x^{2}+2\\sqrt[  ]{ 3 }xy-4=0$:\n$$-2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{x} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}) \\right]^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{x} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}) \\right] \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{y}) \\right] - 4 = 0$$\n$$-2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(\\tilde{x}^2 - 2\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} + 3\\tilde{y}^2) \\right] + 2\\sqrt{3} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - 3\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}^2) \\right] - 4 = 0$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{x}^2 - 2\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} + 3\\tilde{y}^2) + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}^2 - 2\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}^2) - 4 = 0$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - \\frac{3}{2}\\tilde{y}^2 + \\frac{3}{2}\\tilde{x}^2 - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - \\frac{3}{2}\\tilde{y}^2 - 4 = 0$$\n\nCombine the terms:\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\tilde{x}^2 + (\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{3})\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} + \\left(-\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\tilde{y}^2 - 4 = 0 $$\n$$ 1\\tilde{x}^2 + 0\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - 3\\tilde{y}^2 - 4 = 0 $$\n$$ \\tilde{x}^2 - 3\\tilde{y}^2 = 4 $$\n\nThis is the expression for the conic section in the rotated coordinate system, derived using the rotation formulas and the condition to eliminate the $xy$ term, as implied by your notes."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":35552,"completion_tokens":1768,"total_tokens":38122}},"gemini-1747393353885":{"id":"gemini-1747393353885","object":"chat.completion","created":1747393353885,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"","tool_calls":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"lookup","arguments":"{\"hypotheticals\":{\"1\":\"Explain why eliminating the xy term in a conic equation simplifies the equation.\",\"2\":\"What is the purpose of rotating coordinate axes when dealing with conic sections?\",\"3\":\"How does the coefficient of the xy term relate to the orientation of a conic section?\"}}"}}]},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":37483,"completion_tokens":71,"total_tokens":38290}}},"messages":{"user-1-1747384225679-1":1,"user-2-1747384230702-1":2,"user-3-1747384270558-1":3,"assistant-4-1747384273766-1":4,"user-5-1747384335719-1":5,"assistant-6-1747384338479-1":6,"tool-7-1":7,"assistant-8-1747384362349-2":8,"assistant-9-1747384372869-1":9,"user-10-1747384380558-1":10,"assistant-11-1747384384486-1":11,"user-12-1747384435432-1":12,"assistant-13-1747384443051-1":13,"user-14-1747384469864-1":14,"assistant-15-1747384472111-1":15,"user-16-1747384500535-1":16,"assistant-17-1747384502770-1":17,"user-18-1747384515423-1":18,"assistant-19-1747384517037-1":19,"user-20-1747384531055-1":20,"assistant-21-1747384534320-1":21,"user-22-1747384555382-1":22,"assistant-23-1747384558717-1":23,"user-24-1747384569023-1":24,"assistant-25-1747384573214-1":25,"user-26-1747384591679-1":26,"assistant-27-1747384594730-1":27,"user-28-1747393027288-1":28,"assistant-29-1747393031231-1":29,"tool-30-1":30,"assistant-31-1747393040503-1":31,"user-32-1747393087192-1":32,"assistant-33-1747393103322-1":33,"user-34-1747393223617-1":34,"assistant-35-1747393230940-1":35,"user-36-1747393266128-1":36,"assistant-37-1747393276322-1":37,"tool-38-1":38,"assistant-39-1747393283402-1":39,"user-40-1747393347992-1":40,"assistant-41-1747393353885-1":41,"tool-42-1":42},"branches":{"8":[{"assistant-8-1747384342717-1":8}]},"class_name":"SmartThread2","key":"Untitled 1747384166053"},

The zero vector is in $U + W$.\n2.  $U + W$ is closed under vector addition.\n3.  $U + W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHere is the proof:\n\n**Proof that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$:**\n\nSince $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$, they satisfy the subspace properties themselves.\n\n1.  **Zero Vector:** Since $U$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in U$. Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$. Thus, $\\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in $U+W$. So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$.

By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}$.\n    Consider the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w})$\n    Using the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in $V$, we have:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u} + c\\mathbf{w}$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{u}$ is also in $U$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{w}$ is also in $W$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{w}$.

The zero vector is in $U + W$.\n2.  $U + W$ is closed under vector addition.\n3.  $U + W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.\n\nHere is the proof:\n\n**Proof that $U + W$ is a subspace of $V$:**\n\nSince $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$, they satisfy the subspace properties themselves.\n\n1.  **Zero Vector:** Since $U$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in U$. Since $W$ is a subspace, the zero vector $\\mathbf{0} \\in W$. By the definition of $U+W$, the sum of a vector from $U$ and a vector from $W$ is in $U+W$. Thus, $\\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$ is in $U+W$. So, $U+W$ contains the zero vector.\n\n2.  **Closure under Vector Addition:** Let $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ be any two vectors in $U+W$. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_1 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_1 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1$, and there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, $\\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2$.\n    Consider the sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2$:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_1) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Using the associativity and commutativity of vector addition in $V$, we can rearrange this as:\n    $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) + (\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2)$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in U$, their sum $\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ is also in $U$ (by closure under addition in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\in W$, their sum $\\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$ is also in $W$ (by closure under addition in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} = \\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} = \\mathbf{w}_1 + \\mathbf{w}_2$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{sum} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{sum} \\in W$.\n    The sum $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{u}_{sum} + \\mathbf{w}_{sum}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 \\in U+W$. This shows that $U+W$ is closed under vector addition.\n\n3.  **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be any vector in $U+W$ and let $c$ be any scalar. By the definition of $U+W$, there exist vectors $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ such that $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}$.\n    Consider the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v}$:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w})$\n    Using the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in $V$, we have:\n    $c\\mathbf{v} = c\\mathbf{u} + c\\mathbf{w}$\n    Since $U$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{u} \\in U$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{u}$ is also in $U$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $U$).\n    Since $W$ is a subspace and $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$, the scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{w}$ is also in $W$ (by closure under scalar multiplication in $W$).\n    Let $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} = c\\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{u}_{scaled} \\in U$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{scaled} \\in W$.\n    The scalar multiple $c\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}_{scaled} + \\mathbf{w}_{scaled}$ is in the form of a vector from $U$ added to a vector from $W$.\n    Therefore, $c\\mathbf{v} \\in U+W$.

They also state that $\\alpha$ is chosen to eliminate the cross term $xy$.\n\nLet's proceed using the method implied by your notes: substitute the rotation formulas into the equation $-2x^{2}+2\\sqrt[  ]{ 3 }xy-4=0$ and choose $\\alpha$ such that the coefficient of the $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term becomes zero.\n\nFrom the notes, the coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ after substitution is related to the terms involving $\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ and $\\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha$.\n\nLet's re-do the substitution carefully, focusing on the $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ terms:\n$$-2x^2 = -2(\\tilde{x}\\cos\\alpha - \\tilde{y}\\sin\\alpha)^2 = -2(\\tilde{x}^2\\cos^2\\alpha - 2\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha + \\tilde{y}^2\\sin^2\\alpha)$$\nThe $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term from this part is $-2(-2\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha)\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} = 4\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$.\n\n$$2\\sqrt{3}xy = 2\\sqrt{3}(\\tilde{x}\\cos\\alpha - \\tilde{y}\\sin\\alpha)(\\tilde{x}\\sin\\alpha + \\tilde{y}\\cos\\alpha)$$\n$$ = 2\\sqrt{3}(\\tilde{x}^2\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha + \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}\\cos^2\\alpha - \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}\\sin^2\\alpha - \\tilde{y}^2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha)$$\nThe $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term from this part is $2\\sqrt{3}(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha)\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$.\n\nThe original equation is $-2x^{2}+2\\sqrt[  ]{ 3 }xy-4=0$. The terms contributing to $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ are from $-2x^2$ and $2\\sqrt{3}xy$.\nThe total coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ in the transformed equation is:\n$$ 4\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha + 2\\sqrt{3}(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha) $$\nWe want this coefficient to be zero:\n$$ 4\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\alpha + 2\\sqrt{3}(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha) = 0 $$\nUsing double angle identities ($\\sin(2\\alpha) = 2\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha$ and $\\cos(2\\alpha) = \\cos^2\\alpha - \\sin^2\\alpha$):\n$$ 2\\sin(2\\alpha) + 2\\sqrt{3}\\cos(2\\alpha) = 0 $$\n$$ 2\\sin(2\\alpha) = -2\\sqrt{3}\\cos(2\\alpha) $$\nIf $\\cos(2\\alpha) \\neq 0$, we can divide by $2\\cos(2\\alpha)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{\\cos(2\\alpha)} = -\\sqrt{3} $$\n$$ \\tan(2\\alpha) = -\\sqrt{3} $$\n\nThe general solution for $2\\alpha$ is $2\\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} + n\\pi$ for integer $n$. A common choice is $2\\alpha = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, which gives $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\nNow, using $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, we have $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nSubstitute these values into the rotation formulas:\n$$ x = \\tilde{x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\tilde{y}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{x} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}) $$\n$$ y = \\tilde{x}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + \\tilde{y}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{y}) $$\n\nNow substitute these into the original equation $-2x^{2}+2\\sqrt[  ]{ 3 }xy-4=0$:\n$$-2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{x} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}) \\right]^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{x} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}) \\right] \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{y}) \\right] - 4 = 0$$\n$$-2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(\\tilde{x}^2 - 2\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} + 3\\tilde{y}^2) \\right] + 2\\sqrt{3} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - 3\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}^2) \\right] - 4 = 0$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{x}^2 - 2\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} + 3\\tilde{y}^2) + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(\\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}^2 - 2\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{y}^2) - 4 = 0$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - \\frac{3}{2}\\tilde{y}^2 + \\frac{3}{2}\\tilde{x}^2 - \\sqrt{3}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - \\frac{3}{2}\\tilde{y}^2 - 4 = 0$$\n\nCombine the terms:\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\tilde{x}^2 + (\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{3})\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} + \\left(-\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\tilde{y}^2 - 4 = 0 $$\n$$ 1\\tilde{x}^2 + 0\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} - 3\\tilde{y}^2 - 4 = 0 $$\n$$ \\tilde{x}^2 - 3\\tilde{y}^2 = 4 $$\n\nThis is the expression for the conic section in the rotated coordinate system, derived using the rotation formulas and the condition to eliminate the $xy$ term, as implied by your notes."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":35552,"completion_tokens":1768,"total_tokens":38122}},"gemini-1747393353885":{"id":"gemini-1747393353885","object":"chat.completion","created":1747393353885,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"","tool_calls":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"lookup","arguments":"{\"hypotheticals\":{\"1\":\"Explain why eliminating the xy term in a conic equation simplifies the equation.\",\"2\":\"What is the purpose of rotating coordinate axes when dealing with conic sections?\",\"3\":\"How does the coefficient of the xy term relate to the orientation of a conic section?\"}}"}}]},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":37483,"completion_tokens":71,"total_tokens":38290}},"gemini-1747393359340":{"id":"gemini-1747393359340","object":"chat.completion","created":1747393360431,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Based on your notes and the problem statement, the rotation is specifically \"chosen to eliminate the cross term $xy$\".\n\nWhen we substitute the rotation formulas ($x = \\tilde{x}\\cos\\alpha - \\tilde{y}\\sin\\alpha$ and $y = \\tilde{x}\\sin\\alpha + \\tilde{y}\\cos\\alpha$) into the original equation, we get a new equation in terms of $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$.

You are absolutely correct: $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ is **not** the same as $xy$.\n\nHere's the clarification:\n\n1.  **Original Equation:** The equation you started with, $-2x^{2}+2\\sqrt[  ]{ 3 }xy-4=0$, is expressed in terms of the original coordinates $x$ and $y$. The term $2\\sqrt{3}xy$ is the cross term in this original coordinate system.\n\n2.  **Rotation:** We apply a rotation of the coordinate axes by an angle $\\alpha$. This creates a *new* coordinate system with axes labeled $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$.

In other words, we want the coefficient $\\tilde{B}$ of the $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term in the transformed equation to be zero.\n\nSo, we set the coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ in the *transformed* equation to zero to achieve the elimination of the cross term that was present in the *original* equation.

This new equation will have the form:\n    $\\tilde{A}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\tilde{B}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} + \\tilde{C}\\tilde{y}^2 + \\tilde{D}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{E}\\tilde{y} + \\tilde{F} = 0$\n\n4.  **Eliminating the Cross Term:** The goal stated in the problem is to \"eliminate the cross term $xy$\". This means we want the *transformed* equation (in terms of $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$) to *not* have a term involving the product of the new coordinates. In other words, we want the coefficient $\\tilde{B}$ of the $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term in the transformed equation to be zero.\n\nSo, we set the coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ in the *transformed* equation to zero to achieve the elimination of the cross term that was present in the *original* equation. The rotation effectively \"rotates away\" the interaction between the $x$ and $y$ components, resulting in an equation in the new $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ system that is aligned with the principal axes of the conic section and thus has no $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":40556,"completion_tokens":574,"total_tokens":41829}},"gemini-1747393561668":{"id":"gemini-1747393561668","object":"chat.completion","created":1747393565015,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Okay, let's elaborate further on why we need to set the coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ to zero and what that achieves.\n\n1.  **The Original Equation and the Cross Term:** You start with an equation like $-2x^{2}+2\\sqrt[  ]{ 3 }xy-4=0$. The term $2\\sqrt{3}xy$ is called the **cross term**. When a conic section equation in $x$ and $y$ has a cross term ($Bxy$ where $B \\neq 0$), it means the principal axes of the conic (like the major/minor axes of an ellipse or the symmetry axes of a hyperbola/parabola) are *not* aligned with the standard $x$ and $y$ coordinate axes. The conic is \"tilted\".\n\n2.  **The Goal of Rotation:** The purpose of rotating the coordinate system is to find a *new* set of axes, which we call the $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$ axes, that *are* aligned with the principal axes of the conic section.\n\n3.  **The Transformed Equation:** When you substitute the rotation formulas ($x = \\tilde{x}\\cos\\alpha - \\tilde{y}\\sin\\alpha$ and $y = \\tilde{x}\\sin\\alpha + \\tilde{y}\\cos\\alpha$) into the original equation, you are rewriting the equation in terms of these new $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$ coordinates. The resulting equation will look something like:\n    $$\\tilde{A}\\tilde{x}^2 + \\tilde{B}\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y} + \\tilde{C}\\tilde{y}^2 + \\tilde{D}\\tilde{x} + \\tilde{E}\\tilde{y} + \\tilde{F} = 0$$\n    where the coefficients $\\tilde{A}, \\tilde{B}, \\tilde{C}, \\tilde{D}, \\tilde{E}, \\tilde{F}$ depend on the original coefficients $A, B, C, D, E, F$ and the rotation angle $\\alpha$.\n\n4.  **Eliminating the New Cross Term:** If the new $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\tilde{y}$ axes are successfully aligned with the conic's principal axes, the equation in the $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ system will *not* have a cross term. That is, the coefficient $\\tilde{B}$ of the $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term in the *transformed* equation must be zero.\n\nTherefore, setting the coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ in the *transformed* equation to zero is the mathematical condition that determines the specific angle $\\alpha$ needed to align the new axes with the conic's symmetry axes. This eliminates the cross term in the new coordinate system, which was the goal of the rotation.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The original equation has an $xy$ term because the conic is tilted relative to the $x, y$ axes.\n*   We rotate to a new $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ system.\n*   The goal is to choose the rotation angle $\\alpha$ such that the conic is *not* tilted relative to the $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ axes.\n*   This non-tilted state in the $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ system is characterized by the absence of the $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ term.\n*   So, we calculate the coefficient of $\\tilde{x}\\tilde{y}$ in the transformed equation and set it equal to zero to find the correct angle $\\alpha$.\n\nThis process simplifies the equation significantly, making it much easier to identify the type of conic section (ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola) and analyze its properties."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":41139,"completion_tokens":817,"total_tokens":43684}}},"messages":{"user-1-1747384225679-1":1,"user-2-1747384230702-1":2,"user-3-1747384270558-1":3,"assistant-4-1747384273766-1":4,"user-5-1747384335719-1":5,"assistant-6-1747384338479-1":6,"tool-7-1":7,"assistant-8-1747384362349-2":8,"assistant-9-1747384372869-1":9,"user-10-1747384380558-1":10,"assistant-11-1747384384486-1":11,"user-12-1747384435432-1":12,"assistant-13-1747384443051-1":13,"user-14-1747384469864-1":14,"assistant-15-1747384472111-1":15,"user-16-1747384500535-1":16,"assistant-17-1747384502770-1":17,"user-18-1747384515423-1":18,"assistant-19-1747384517037-1":19,"user-20-1747384531055-1":20,"assistant-21-1747384534320-1":21,"user-22-1747384555382-1":22,"assistant-23-1747384558717-1":23,"user-24-1747384569023-1":24,"assistant-25-1747384573214-1":25,"user-26-1747384591679-1":26,"assistant-27-1747384594730-1":27,"user-28-1747393027288-1":28,"assistant-29-1747393031231-1":29,"tool-30-1":30,"assistant-31-1747393040503-1":31,"user-32-1747393087192-1":32,"assistant-33-1747393103322-1":33,"user-34-1747393223617-1":34,"assistant-35-1747393230940-1":35,"user-36-1747393266128-1":36,"assistant-37-1747393276322-1":37,"tool-38-1":38,"assistant-39-1747393283402-1":39,"user-40-1747393347992-1":40,"assistant-41-1747393353885-1":41,"tool-42-1":42,"assistant-43-1747393359341-1":43,"user-44-1747393480998-1":44,"assistant-45-1747393486261-1":45,"user-46-1747393549607-1":46,"assistant-47-1747393561668-1":47},"branches":{"8":[{"assistant-8-1747384342717-1":8}]},"class_name":"SmartThread2","key":"Untitled 1747384166053"},
