\section{The figure shows, in cross-section, portions of two infinitely large, parallel, non-conducting sheets, each with a uniform charge distribution. The charge density for the sheet on the left is $+3\sigma$ and that for the sheet on the right is $-\sigma$. Find the magnitude and direction of the total electric field $\mathbf{\underline{E}}$ in terms of $\sigma$:}

\subsection{To the left of both sheets.}

$$
E_{LP}=\frac{3\sigma}{2\varepsilon_{0}}\qquad E_{RP}=- \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_{0}}
$$
$$
E_{LP}+E_{RP}= \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}}\text{ to the left}
$$
\subsection{Between the sheets.}
$$
E_{LP}-E_{RP}= \frac{2\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}}\text{ to the left}
$$
\subsection{To the right of both sheets.}
$$
E_{LP}+E_{RP}= \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_{0}}\text{ to the right}
$$
\section{A sphere $S_{1}$ of radius $R_{1}$ contains charge with a uniform density $\rho$. A spherical cavity $S_{2}$ of radius $R_{2}$ is cut out of the sphere. The centres of the spheres are separated by a vector distance $a$, with $R_{2} + a < R_{1}$. Derive an expression for the electric field $E$ as a function of $a$ and $\rho$ in a generic location inside the spherical cavity. (Hint: Use the superposition principle to replace this sphere by two objects which are equivalent and keep everything in vector form.)}
$$
\underline{\mathbf{E}}= \int ^{}_{} -q\rho  \, d \underline{R_{2}}
