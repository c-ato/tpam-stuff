1.1 Applying Kirchhoff’s Current Law at node $a$, which of the following equations is correct? (Refer to the circuit diagram below for current labels.)

![[{0BF39147-AD3C-48AE-A839-FA7F10DEB482}.png]]
$$
I_{2}=I_{1}+I_{3}
$$
1.2 Apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to the loop containing the $10 V$ source, but not the $5 V$ source. Which of the following equations is correct?
$$
2I_{2}+3I_{3}=10=2I_{2}+I_{1}\implies 10-2I_{2}-I_{1}=0
$$
1.3 Apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to the loop containing the $5 V$ source, but not the $10 V$ source. Which of the following equations is correct?
$$
2I_{2}+3I_{3}=5=I_{1}+3I_{3}\implies I_{1}+3I_{3}-5=0
$$
1.4 Use Kirchoff's laws to find the current in the $1\Omega$ resistor in the circuit shown.}
$$
\begin{array}{}
3I_{A}+I_{B}&=&10 \\
I_{A}+4I_{B}&=&5 \\
I_{A}+I_{B}&=&I_{C}
\end{array}
$$
$$
I_{A}= \frac{35}{11}\qquad I_{B}=\frac{5}{11}\qquad I_{C}= \frac{40}{11}=3.636\dots A
$$
