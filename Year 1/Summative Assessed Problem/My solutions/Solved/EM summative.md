1) $N$ charged raindrops each with radius $a$ all have the the same potential. Assume that they are far enough apart so that the charge distribution on each is not affected by the others (that is, each are spherically symmetric).

 1. What is the total capacitance of the system? [2]
$$
C=4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a\implies C_{Total}=NC=4\pi\varepsilon_{0}Na
	$$
 2. If there is a total charge Q on the raindrops, what is the potential of each of them? [1]
$$
Q=CV\iff V=\frac{Q}{C}=\frac{Q_{Total}}{C_{Total}}=\frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}Na}
$$
 3. How does the capacitance compare with the capacitance in the case where the drops are combined into one big drop? (the total volume of water does not change) [2]
$$
\frac{4}{3}\pi a^{3}N=\frac{4}{3}\pi A^{3}\implies A=aN^{1/3}\qquad C=4\pi\varepsilon_{0}A=4\pi\varepsilon_{0}aN^{1/3}
$$
2) A spherical conducting shell has radius $R$ and potential $\phi$. (If you wish, you may consider it to be part of a capacitor with the other shell at infinity.) You compress the shell down to zero size (always keeping it spherical), while a battery holds the potential constant at $\phi$.
 
 1. What are the initial and final energies stored in the system? [2]
$$
C=4\pi\varepsilon_{0}R\qquad\frac{1}{2}C\phi^{2}=W
$$
$$
W_{initial}\overset{ R=R }{ = }2\pi\varepsilon_{0}R\phi^{2}\qquad W_{final}\overset{ R=0 }{ = }0
$$
 2. What is the final charge on the shell? [1]
$$
Q=CV\overset{ R=0 }{ \implies }Q=0
$$
 3. What is the work done by or on the battery? [1]
$$
\Delta W_{\text{on bat}}=W_{final}-W_{initial}=-2\pi\varepsilon_{0}R\phi^{2}
$$
 4. What is the work done by or on you? [1]
$$
\Delta W_{\text{on me}}=2\pi\varepsilon_{0}R\phi^{2}
$$
