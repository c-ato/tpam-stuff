1. In the circuit shown above, what is the initial voltage across the $3\,k\Omega$ resistor immediately after the switch $S$ is closed? [2 points]

There exists a path with $0\Omega$ so all current takes that path so no current across the $3k\Omega$ 

2. In the circuit shown above, what is the initial voltage across the $3\,k\Omega$ resistor after the switch S has been closed for a long time? [2 points]
$$
\frac{3}{4}\cdot 28=21V
$$
3. In the circuit shown above, what is the initial power dissipated in the network immediately after the switch S is closed? [3 points]
For all resistors, the $V=0$
$$
\therefore P=0W
$$
4. In the circuit shown above, what is the initial power dissipated in the network after the switch S has been closed for a long time? [3 points]
$$
\frac{7^{2}}{1k}+ \frac{21^{2}}{3k}=196mW
$$
