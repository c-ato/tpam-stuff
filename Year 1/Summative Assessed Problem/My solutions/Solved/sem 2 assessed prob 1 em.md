\section{Three charges, $+q$, $+Q$ and $-Q$, are placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle as shown in the Figure.}

\subsection{Which of the following statements is true? The net force on the charge $+q$ due to the other two charges is:}
(e), horizontally to the right

\subsection{Which of the above statements is true if the $-Q$ charge is replaced by a $+Q$ charge}
(b), vertically down

\section{Two charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are placed at the vertices of a right-angled triangle as shown in the Figure below. The value of the charge $q_{1}$ is $|q_{1}| = 15 \mu C$, but its sign is not know. For the charge $q_{2}$, both the sign and the magnitude are not known. The resulting electric field $E$ produced by the two charges at $P$ is as shown, in the negative $y$ direction.}

\subsection{Based on symmetry considerations, deduce the sign of the charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$.}
They will both be negative - $E$ is down towards and nothing horizontally

\subsection{Evaluate the value of the charge $q_{2}$.}
$$
\sin \theta= \frac{5}{13}\qquad \cos \theta= \frac{12}{13}\qquad \tan \theta = \frac{5}{12}
$$
We may consider that the $E_{x}$ component is equal to 0 so:
$$
\frac{q_{1}}{\cancel{ 4\pi\varepsilon_{0} }\cdot5^{2}}\sin \theta= \frac{q_{2}}{\cancel{ 4\pi\varepsilon_{0} }\cdot 12^{2}}\cos \theta\iff q_{2}= q_{1} \left( \frac{12}{5} \right)^{2}\tan \theta=q_{1} \frac{12}{5}=-36\mu C
$$
\subsection{Evaluate the magnitude of the electric field $E$ at $P$.}
$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{q_{1}}{0.05^{2}}\cos \theta+\frac{q_{2}}{0.12^{2}}\sin \theta \right)=5.841\dots \times 10^{7} NC^{-1}
$$
