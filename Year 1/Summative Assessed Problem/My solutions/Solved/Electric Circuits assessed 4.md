After being open for a long time, the switch $S$, in the circuit shown below is closed at $t=0$ for $1\, ms$, and then opened again.

1. What is the behaviour of the inductor immediately after the switch is closed at $t=0$?

Open circuits

2. What is the initial voltage across the $125 \,\Omega$ resistor immediately after the switch is closed $(0<t<1\,ms)$?
$$
V(R_{125\Omega})=24V
$$
3. After a sufficiently long time after the switch has been closed, how does the inductor behave?

S/C

4. After a sufficiently long time after the switch is closed, what will be the voltage across the $125\,\Omega$ resistor?
$$
V(R_{125\Omega})=0V
$$
5. While the switch is closed, what is the Thévenin equivalent resistance looking back into the circuit from the inductor’s perspective?
$$
R_{Th}=100\Omega
$$
6. What is the time constant of the circuit when $0 < t < 1\,ms$?
$$
\tau= \frac{L}{R}=0.2\,ms
$$
7. What is the voltage across the $125\,\Omega$ resistor at $t = 1\,ms$?
$$
V_{init}-V_{init}\left( 1-e^{ - \frac{t}{\tau}} \right)=V_{init}e^{ - \frac{t}{\tau} }= 24\cdot e^{ - \frac{1\times 10^{-3}}{2\times 10^{-4}} }=14.5\dots V\approx 15V
$$
8. What is the current flowing through the inductor at $t = 1\,ms$?
$$
i=\frac{V}{R}\left( 1-e^{ - \frac{Rt}{L} } \right)=0.094\dots A
$$
9. What is the voltage across the $125\,\Omega$ resistor immediately after the switch is opened $(t > 1\,ms)$?
$$
V=15V
$$
10. What is the time constant of the circuit after the switch is opened $(t > 1\,ms)$?
$$
\tau=0.2\, ms
