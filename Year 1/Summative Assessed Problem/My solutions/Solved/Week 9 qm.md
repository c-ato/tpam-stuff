\subsection{Estimate the minimum energy of a proton of mass $1.673 \times 10^{–27} kg$ confined to an infinite one-dimensional potential well of width $10^{–14}$ m. Express your answer in $MeV$. [2 marks]}

$$
E= n^{2} \frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}},n=1,L=10^{-14}\implies E_\text{min}=3.28\dots \times 10^{-13}J=2.047\dots MeV
$$

\subsection{State Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle for momentum and position and briefly explain its physical significance. [2 marks]}

We cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle to higher degrees as their products errors: $\Delta x \times \Delta p< \frac{\hbar}{2}$. This has implications on the resolution and certainty that physics experiments can have.

\subsection{A beam of $50 eV$ electrons travelling in the $+x$ direction passes through a slit that is parallel to the y-axis and $6 \mu m$ wide. A diffraction pattern is observed at a distance $1 m$ from the slit as illustrated in the figure below.

From classical wave theory, the angle of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by $\theta =\sin ^{-1}\left( \frac{\lambda}{d} \right)$, where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons and $d$ is the width of the slit. Show that the observed width of the central maximum, measured by the distance between the two minima either side of $z=0$, does not violate Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle. [6 marks]}
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}=\frac{h}{\sqrt[  ]{ 2Em }}=1.73\dots \times 10^{-10}m
$$
$$
\Delta x \Delta p > \frac{\hbar}{2} \iff \Delta x > \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta p}, p=\pm \frac{h}{\lambda}\therefore \Delta p=\frac{h}{\lambda}\implies \Delta x > \frac{\lambda}{4\pi}=1.38\dots \times 10^{-11}m
$$
Given that $\theta$ is small, we use the small angle approximation $\tan \theta\approx \sin \theta$
$$
 \theta=\sin ^{-1} \frac{\lambda}{d}  \implies \sin \theta=\frac{\lambda}{d}, x=\pm L\tan \theta\implies\Delta x = L\tan \theta \approx L\sin \theta= \frac{L\lambda}{d}\overset{ L,n=1 }{ \underset{d=6\mu m}{\implies} }2.89\dots\times 10^{-5}
$$
$\therefore$ the distances measured for the minima do not violate Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle as the uncertainty of $x$ given by it, is higher than the lowest possible uncertainty
