\section{Molybdenum is commonly used as a target material in commercial X-ray tubes. The average ionisation energies of the $K$, $L$ and $M$ electron shells in molybdenum are $20002 eV$, $2573 eV$, and $284 eV$, respectively.}

\subsection{If electrons are accelerated toward the target through a potential difference of $35 kV$, what is the cutoff wavelength in the Bremsstrahlung spectrum? [2 marks]}
$$
\frac{hc}{\lambda_{min}}=eV\implies\lambda_{min}=\frac{hc}{eV}=3.544\dots \times 10 ^{-11}m
$$
\subsection{Use the data provided to calculate the wavelengths of any discrete lines that may appear in the spectrum. [3 marks]} 
$$
hc\left( \frac{1}{eV_{M}}-\frac{1}{eV_{L}} \right)=\lambda_{ML}=3.88\dots\times 10^{-9}m,\lambda_{MK}=4.30\dots \times 10^{-9},\lambda_{LK}=4.20\dots \times 10^{-10}
$$

\subsection{Use the information gathered in parts (a) and (b) to draw a reasonably accurate diagram of the wavelength spectrum of X-rays that will be produced in a $35 kV$ molybdenum X-ray tube. Label the key features in the spectrum. [3 marks]}

\subsection{How would the X-ray spectrum change if the acceleration potential difference is lowered to 19.8 kV?[2 marks]}
$$
\text{No changes except }\lambda_{min}=6.266\dots \times 10^{-11}m
$$
