\section{An airplane is flying at a constant altitude at a steady speed $u$ which is greater than the speed of sound. At one instant in time, the shock wave arrives at point $B$. In the diagram below, $\theta$ is the Mach cone angle}

\subsection{For the moment an observer at point $B$ heard the sonic boom, what did observers at $A$, $C$ and $D$ hear? Explain your reasoning. Just in case that you get worried about the observer at point $D$, I can assure you that the observer at point $D$ can move out of the way with super-supersonic speed and hence would not cause unnecessary damage to the airplane due to a potential head-on collision. [4]}

The observer at A will be hearing the receding and doppler shifted (to lower frequencies/higher wavelengths) sounds of the plane as the plane's Mach cone has already intersected point A at a previous and current moment and therefore the sound waves of the plane are able to reach it as they propagate in all directions from the planes previous points with c. It is doppler shifted because as the plane travelled forwards there are less wave fronts behind as it is generating and moving along with the wavefronts at the front.

The observer at C will not be able to hear any of the sounds yet, as the sound waves are travelling with the Mach cone (made from the sounds waves) which is travelling at c (speed of sound) from the previous and current which have not arrived yet as u is greater than c so the plane has travelled farther (above C) than the waves and it also takes time for the sound to propagate downwards.

D will also not hear anything as the plane travels faster than c at which the sound waves arrives.

\subsection{Two train whistles, $A$ and $B$, each has a frequency of $390 Hz$. $A$ is stationary and $B$ is moving away towards the right at a speed of $40.0 m/s$. An athlete is running after train $B$ at a speed of $14.0 m/s$. What is the frequency from $A$ heard by the athlete? What is the frequency from $B$ heard by the athlete? (Speed of sound in air is 340m s-1) [4]}
$$
v_{A}=0,v_{Ath}=14.0,v_{B}=40.0,c=40
$$
$$
f_{A}=\frac{340+14}{340+40}390=363.31\dots Hz\qquad f_{B}=\frac{340-14}{340}390=373.74\dots Hz
$$
\subsection{The athlete also hears an echo of whistle $A$ from the back of train $B$. What frequency is this echo? [2]}
$$
\left( \frac{340-40}{340}\times390 \right) \times\frac{340 +14}{340+40}=320.57\dots Hz
$$
