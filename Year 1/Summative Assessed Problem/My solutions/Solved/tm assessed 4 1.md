1. Consider the isothermal compression $0.1$ mole of an ideal gas at a temperature $T=27 °C$. Initially, the gas is at atmospheric pressure, and the initial volume is one-eighth of the initial volume. What is the work done on the gas? [2] 
$$
\Delta U=0=Q_{in}+W_{on} \iff W_{on}=-\int ^{\frac{V}{8}}_{V} p \, dV\qquad 
$$
$$
p=\frac{nRT}{V}\implies W_{on}= nRT\int ^{V}_{\frac{V}{8}} \frac{1}{V} \, dV==nRT\ln \left( \frac{V}{\frac{V}{8}} \right)=0.1\cdot 8.314\cdot 300 \cdot \ln\left( 8 \right)=518.65\dots J
$$
2. What is the change in internal energy of the gas during the isothermal compression described in Question 1? [1͐] 
$$
\Delta U=0J
$$
3. During the isothermal compression, which of the below describes the heat exchanged of the gas with its surroundings? \[Note: The answers state magnitude in Joules and direction\] [1͐] 

$518.65\dots J$ out of the system, into the environment

4. A petrol engine takes in air at $20°C$ and atmospheric pressure and compresses it adiabatically to one-third the original volume. What is final temperature of the air, assuming air is an ideal gas with $\gamma=1.4$ [2͑] 
$$
=T_{1}V_{1}^{0.4}=k=T_{2}\left( \frac{V_{1}}{3} \right)^{0.4}\implies T_{2}= T_{1} \cdot 3^{0.4}=293\cdot 3^{0.4}=454.69\dots K=181.69\dots °C
$$
5. For the adiabatic compression in Question 4, what is the final pressure of the air? [͐1]
$$
p_{1}V_{1}^{\gamma}=p_{2}\left( \frac{V_{1}}{3} \right)^{\gamma}=3^{\gamma}p_{1}=3^{1.4}\cdot 100kPa=465.55\dots kPa
