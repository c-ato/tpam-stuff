An ideal gas is initially in a state $i$ labelled by $p_{i}$, $V_{i}$ and $T_{i}$. It undergoes an isothermal expansion to an intermediate state $m$ for which the pressure is $p_{m} = p_{i}/2$. The gas is then isobarically compressed to a final state $f$ until the volume has returned to its initial value, $V_{i}$.

1. Define the terms isothermal and isobaric. If the ideal gas was in a closed container and unable to exchange heat with its surroundings, what kind of expansion would this be? [3]

Isothermal refers to changing a system without changing its temperature.

Isobaric refers to changing a system without changing its pressure.

Am expansion in a closed contained where head exchange does not happen is adiabatic expansion.

2. Determine the values of the variables $p$, $V$ and $T$ for the states $m$ and $f$ in terms of $p_{i}$, $V_{i}$ and $T_{i}$. [7]
$$
p_{m}=\frac{p_{i}}{2}\qquad T_{i}=T_{m}\implies V_{m}=2V_{i}\qquad V_{f}=\frac{V_{m}}{2}=V_{i}\qquad p_{m}=p_{f}=\frac{p_{i}}{2}\implies T_{f}=\frac{T_{m}}{2}=\frac{T_{i}}{2}
$$
