The loop of wire in the figure below forms a right triangle and carries a current $I=5A$ in the direction shown. The loop is in a uniform magnetic field that has magnitude $B=3T$ and the same direction as the current inside $PQ$ of the loop.

1. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by the magnetic field on side PQ of the triangle?
$$
F_{PQ}=0
$$
2. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by the magnetic field on side PR of the triangle?
$$
F=I \mathbf{\underline{L}}\times \mathbf{\underline{B}}=5\cdot3\cdot 0.8=12N
$$
3. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by the magnetic field on side QR of the triangle?
$$
F=BIL\cos \theta = 5 \cdot 3 \cdot QR \cdot \frac{0.8}{QR}=12N
$$
4. What is the magnitude of the net torque on the loop?
$$
m=Fd=12\cdot 0.3=3.6
$$
5. Does the torque tend to rotate point Q into the plane of the figure or out of the plane?

Into the plane

6. An interstellar dust grain of mass $m=10^{-16}\,kg$ is roughly spherical with a radius of $3\times 10^{-7}\,m$. It has acquired a negative charge such that its potential is $-0.15V$. To the nearest whole number, how many extra electrons has the dust grain picked up?
$$
Q=CV=4\pi\varepsilon_{0}rV\implies N_{e^{-}}= \frac{Q}{-e}= \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}rV}{-e}=31.25\dots \approx 31
$$
7. What is the strength of the electric field on the surface of the dust grain?
$$
\sigma=\frac{Q}{A}=\frac{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}rV}{4\pi r}= \varepsilon_{0}V\qquad E= \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_{0}}=\frac{V}{2}=-0.075NC^{-1}
$$
8. The dust grain moves freely (with velocity much smaller than the speed of light) in a plane perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field, which in that region has a strength of $3×10^{-10}T$. What is the “cyclotron frequency” associated with the dust grain’s motion?
$$
f= \frac{QB}{2\pi m}=2.39\dots \times 10^{-12}
$$
9. Approximately how many years will it take for the dust grain to complete a circular orbit?
$$
v=\omega r=\frac{2\pi r}{T}\qquad BQv=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\implies BQ=\frac{2\pi mr}{Tr}\implies T=\frac{2\pi m}{BQ}= \frac{2\pi m}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}rVB}=\frac{m}{2\varepsilon_{0}r_{dust}VB} 
$$
$$
=\frac{10^{-16}}{3\times 10^{-10}\cdot 0.15\cdot3\times 10^{-7}\cdot\varepsilon_{0}\cdot 2}=4.18\dots \times 10^{11}s=13255.11\dots years
