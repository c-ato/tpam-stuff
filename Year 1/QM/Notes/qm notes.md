Coulomb Potential Energy: $u(r)=\frac{qQ}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}r}$

#side-note integrating force gives energy, so likewise diff energy equation gives a force equation for the energy's respective force

Force: $F(r)=-\frac{du}{dr}=- \frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}$

$$
\int ^{u_{2}}_{u_{1}}  \, du =-\int ^{r_{2}}_{r_{1}} F(r) \, dr 
$$
$$
\underbrace{ u_{2}-u_{1} }_{ \Delta u }=-\int ^{r_{2}}_{r_{1}} F(r) \, dr 
$$

Outside entire plum model is considered Q, whereas within the pudding, it is treated as a smaller point charge Q'(r)

Force within a point charge is 0 - EMI lectures next term

If charge spread evenrly, total  $Q\propto V$ 

$$
\frac{Q'}{Q}=\frac{4\pi r^{3}}{4\pi a^{3}}\implies Q'=Q \frac{r^{3}}{a^{3}}
$$

$$
{ \Delta u }=-\int ^{a}_{\infty} F(r) \, dr 
$$
$$
\Delta u=\frac{3}{2} \frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}a}\overset{ a=10^{-10} }{ \implies }\Delta u=3.41keV\ll E_{\alpha}=5MeV
$$

Therfore the plum pudding cannot backscatter a 5MeV $\alpha$ particle

 but sufficiently small can

$$
{ \Delta u }=-\int ^{a}_{\infty} F(r) \, dr =5MeV\implies a\leq 45fm
$$
So atom is $10^{-10}m$ and nucleus is $45fm$
